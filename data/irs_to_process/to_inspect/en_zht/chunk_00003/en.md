#### Self-Employment (SE) Tax
SE tax is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves. It is similar to the social security and Medicare taxes withheld from the pay of most wage earners.
**Social security coverage.**
Social security benefits are available to self-employed persons just as they are to wage earners. Your payments of SE tax contribute to your coverage under the social security system. Social security coverage provides you with retirement benefits, disability benefits, survivor benefits, and hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits.
_**How to become insured under social security.**_
You must be insured under the social security system before you begin receiving social security benefits. You are insured if you have the required number of credits (also called quarters of coverage), discussed next. 
_**Earning credits in 2024 and 2025.**_
For 2024, you received one credit, up to a maximum of four credits, for each $1,730 ($1,810 for 2025) of income subject to social security tax. Therefore, for 2024, if you had income (self-employment and wages) of $6,920 that was subject to social security tax, you received four credits ($6,920 ÷ $1,730). 
For an explanation of the number of credits you must have to be insured and the benefits available to you and your family under the social security program, consult your nearest SSA office.
**The SSA time limit for posting self-employment income.**
Generally, the SSA will give you credit only for self-employment income reported on a tax return filed within 3 years, 3 months, and 15 days after the tax year you earned the income. If you file your tax return or report a change in your self-employment income after this time limit, the SSA may change its record but only to remove or reduce the amount. The SSA will not change its records to increase your self-employment income. 
**Who must pay SE tax.**
You must pay SE tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040) if either of the following applies. 
  1. Your net earnings from self-employment (excluding church employee income) were $400 or more.
  2. You had church employee income of $108.28 or more. 
**SE tax rate.**
The SE tax rate on net earnings is 15.3% (12.4% social security tax plus 2.9% Medicare tax). 
**Maximum earnings subject to SE tax.**
Only the first $168,600 of your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 is subject to any combination of the 12.4% social security part of SE tax, social security tax, or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax. 
All your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 are subject to any combination of the 2.9% Medicare part of SE tax, Medicare tax, or Medicare part of railroad retirement tax.
If wages and tips you receive as an employee are subject to either social security tax or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax, or both, and total at least $168,600, do not pay the 12.4% social security part of the SE tax on any of your net earnings. However, you must pay the 2.9% Medicare part of the SE tax on all your net earnings.
**Additional Medicare Tax.**
A 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax may apply to you if your net earnings from self-employment exceed one of the following threshold amounts (based on your filing status).
  * Married filing jointly—$250,000
  * Married filing separately—$125,000
  * Single, Head of household, or Qualifying surviving spouse—$200,000
If you have both wages and self-employment income, the threshold amount for applying the Additional Medicare Tax on the self-employment income is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. Use Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax, to figure this tax.
**More information.**
