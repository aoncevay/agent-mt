## 6. How To Figure Cost of Goods Sold
#### Introduction
If you make or buy goods to sell, you can deduct the cost of goods sold from your gross receipts on Schedule C. However, to determine these costs, you must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year.
This chapter applies to you if you are a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer or if you are engaged in any business that makes, buys, or sells goods to produce income. This chapter does not apply to a personal service business, such as the business of a doctor, lawyer, carpenter, or painter. However, if you work in a personal service business and also sell or charge for the materials and supplies normally used in your business, this chapter applies to you.
#### Figuring Cost of Goods Sold on Schedule C, Lines 35 Through 42
Figure your cost of goods sold by filling out lines 35 through 42 of Schedule C. These lines are reproduced below and are explained in the discussion that follows.
**35** | Inventory at beginning of year. If different from last year's closing inventory, attach explanation | _____  
---|---|---  
**36** | Purchases less cost of items withdrawn for personal use | _____  
**37** | Cost of labor. Do not include any amounts paid to yourself | _____  
**38** | Materials and supplies | _____  
**39** | Other costs |   
**40** | Add lines 35 through 39 | _____  
**41** | Inventory at end of year |   
**42** | **Cost of goods sold.** Subtract line 41 from line 40. Enter the result here and on line 4 |   
#### Line 35—Inventory at Beginning of Year
If you are a merchant, beginning inventory is the cost of merchandise on hand at the beginning of the year that you will sell to customers. If you are a manufacturer or producer, it includes the total cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and materials and supplies used in manufacturing the goods (see _Inventories_ in chapter 2).
Opening inventory will usually be identical to the closing inventory of the year before. You must explain any difference in a schedule attached to your return.
**Donation of inventory.**
If you contribute inventory (property that you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can claim as a contribution deduction is the smaller of its fair market value on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of donated inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold.
If the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year.
A special rule may apply to certain donations of food inventory. See Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.
**Example 1.**
You are a calendar year taxpayer who uses an accrual method of accounting. In 2024, you contributed property from inventory to a church. It had a fair market value of $600. The closing inventory at the end of 2023 properly included $400 of costs due to the acquisition of the property, and in 2023, you properly deducted $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property as business expenses. The charitable contribution allowed for 2024 is $400 ($600 − $200). The $200 is the amount that would be ordinary income if you had sold the contributed inventory at fair market value on the date of the gift. The cost of goods sold you use in determining gross income for 2024 must not include the $400. You remove that amount from opening inventory for 2024.
**Example 2.**
If, in _Example 1_ , you acquired the contributed property in 2024 at a cost of $400, you would include the $400 cost of the property in figuring the cost of goods sold for 2024 and deduct the $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property for that year. You would not be allowed any charitable contribution deduction for the contributed property.
#### Line 36—Purchases Less Cost of Items Withdrawn for Personal Use
If you are a merchant, use the cost of all merchandise you bought for sale. If you are a manufacturer or producer, this includes the cost of all raw materials or parts purchased for manufacture into a finished product.
**Trade discounts.**
The differences between the stated prices of articles and the actual prices you pay for them are called trade discounts. You must use the prices you pay (not the stated prices) in figuring your cost of purchases. Do not show the discount amount separately as an item in gross income.
An automobile dealer must record the cost of a car in inventory reduced by any manufacturer's rebate that represents a trade discount. 
**Cash discounts.**
Cash discounts are amounts your suppliers let you deduct from your purchase invoices for prompt payments. There are two methods of accounting for cash discounts. You can either credit them to a separate discount account or deduct them from total purchases for the year. Whichever method you use, you must be consistent. If you want to change your method of figuring inventory cost, you must file Form 3115. For more information, see _Change in Accounting Method_ in chapter 2.
If you credit cash discounts to a separate account, you must include this credit balance in your business income at the end of the tax year. If you use this method, do not reduce your cost of goods sold by the cash discounts.
**Purchase returns and allowances.**
You must deduct all returns and allowances from your total purchases during the year.
**Merchandise withdrawn from sale.**
If you withdraw merchandise for your personal or family use, you must exclude this cost from the total amount of merchandise you bought for sale. Do this by crediting the purchases or sales account with the cost of merchandise you withdraw for personal use. You must also charge the amount to your drawing account. 
A drawing account is a separate account you should keep to record the business income you withdraw to pay for personal and family expenses. As stated above, you also use it to record withdrawals of merchandise for personal or family use. This account is also known as a withdrawals account or personal account. 
#### Line 37—Cost of Labor
Labor costs are usually an element of cost of goods sold only in a manufacturing or mining business. Small merchandisers (wholesalers, retailers, etc.) usually do not have labor costs that can properly be charged to cost of goods sold. In a manufacturing business, labor costs properly allocable to the cost of goods sold include both the direct and indirect labor used in fabricating the raw material into a finished, saleable product.
**Direct labor.**
Direct labor costs are the wages you pay to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. They also include a part of the wages you pay to employees who work directly on the product part time if you can determine that part of their wages. 
**Indirect labor.**
Indirect labor costs are the wages you pay to employees who perform a general factory function that does not have any immediate or direct connection with making the saleable product, but that is a necessary part of the manufacturing process.
**Other labor.**
Other labor costs not properly chargeable to the cost of goods sold can be deducted as selling or administrative expenses. Generally, the only kinds of labor costs properly chargeable to your cost of goods sold are the direct or indirect labor costs and certain other costs treated as overhead expenses properly charged to the manufacturing process, as discussed later under _Line 39—Other Costs_.
#### Line 38—Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies, such as hardware and chemicals, used in manufacturing goods are charged to cost of goods sold. Those that are not used in the manufacturing process are treated as deferred charges. You deduct them as a business expense when you use them. Business expenses are discussed in chapter 8.
#### Line 39—Other Costs
Examples of other costs incurred in a manufacturing or mining process that you charge to your cost of goods sold are as follows.
**Containers.**
Containers and packages that are an integral part of the product manufactured are a part of your cost of goods sold. If they are not an integral part of the manufactured product, their costs are shipping or selling expenses. 
**Freight-in.**
Freight-in, express-in, and cartage-in on raw materials, supplies you use in production, and merchandise you purchase for sale are all part of cost of goods sold. 
**Overhead expenses.**
Overhead expenses include expenses such as rent, heat, light, power, insurance, depreciation, taxes, maintenance, labor, and supervision. The overhead expenses you have as direct and necessary expenses of the manufacturing operation are included in your cost of goods sold. 
#### Line 40—Add Lines 35 Through 39
The total of lines 35 through 39 equals the cost of the goods available for sale during the year.
#### Line 41—Inventory at End of Year
Subtract the value of your closing inventory (including, as appropriate, the allocable parts of the cost of raw materials and supplies, direct labor, and overhead expenses) from line 40. Inventory at the end of the year is also known as closing or ending inventory. Your ending inventory will usually become the beginning inventory of your next tax year.
#### Line 42—Cost of Goods Sold
When you subtract your closing inventory (inventory at the end of the year) from the cost of goods available for sale, the remainder is your cost of goods sold during the tax year.

## 6. 如何計算銷貨成本
#### 介紹
如果您製造或購買商品以進行銷售，您可從附表 C 上的總收入中扣除銷貨成本。然而，為確定這些成本，在每個稅務年度初和末，您須估算庫存的價值。
如果您是生產商、批發商，或從事任何生產、購買或出售商品的業務以產生收入，則本章適用於您。本章不適用於個人服務型業務，例如醫師、律師、木工或油漆工等業務。然而，如果您從事個人服務業務，且也出售通常在您的業務中使用的物料和供應品，或收取這些物料和供應品的費用，則本章適用於您。
#### 計算銷貨成本—— 附表 C 第 35 行至第 42 行
請填寫附表 C第 35 行至第 42 行，以計算您的銷貨成本。這幾行複製如下，並在 隨後的討論中予以解釋。
**35** | 年初庫存。如果與去年的年末庫存不同，請附上解釋 | _____  
---|---|---  
**36** | 採購額減去支取以供個人使用的商品的成本 | _____  
**37** | 人工成本。請不要包含向您自己支付的任何金額 | _____  
**38** | 物料和供應品 | _____  
**39** | 其他成本 |   
**40** | 將第 35 行至第 39 行相加 | _____  
**41** | 年末庫存 |   
**42** | **銷貨成本。** 第 40 行減去第 41 行。 在此處和第 4 行輸入結果 |   
#### 第 35 行, 年初庫存
如果您是商家，期初庫存是您將出售給客戶的年初現有商品的成本。如果您是生產商或製造商，此項目包含原材料、在製品、成品和生產商品時使用的物料和供應品的總成本（請參閱第 2 章 _庫存_ ）。
年初庫存通常與前一年的年末庫存相同。您須在報稅表隨附的附表中對任何差額作出解釋。
**庫存捐贈。**
如果您捐贈庫存（即您在業務過程中出售的財產），您可以申報的捐贈扣除額是您捐贈庫存之日其公平市值與庫存基數中的較小者。已捐贈的庫存的基數是在捐贈当年本應包含在您的年初庫存中、在較早年度因庫存而產生的任何成本。您須從您的年初庫存中扣除您的捐贈扣除額。這不是銷貨成本的一部分。
如果已捐贈庫存的成本沒有包含在您的年初庫存中，則庫存的基數為零，所以您不能申報慈善捐贈扣除額。按照您通常採用的會計方法處理庫存成本。例如，將當年購買和捐贈的庫存的購買價格計入當年的銷貨成本中。
特別規則可能適用於若干類食品庫存捐贈。請參閱 526 號刊物【慈善捐獻】。
**範例 1。**
您是採用日曆年度的納稅人，使用應計會計制。2024 年，您從庫存向教會捐獻了財產。該財產的公平市值是 600 美元。2023 年底的期末庫存適當地包含了因收購該財產而產生的 400 美元成本，且在 2023 年，作為營業費用，您適當地扣除了 50 美元因該財產而產生的行政和其他支出。2024 年允許的慈善捐獻額是 400 美元（600 美元 − 200 美元）。假如您在捐獻之日按公平市值出售捐獻的庫存，那麼 200 美元就是普通收入的金額。用於確定 2024 年總收入的銷貨成本不得包括 400 美元。您要在 2024 年的期初庫存中去除該金額。
**範例 2。**
如果在 _範例 1_ 中，您以 400 美元成本在 2024 年收購了捐獻的財產，您會在計算 2024 年的銷貨成本時包含該財產的 400 美元成本，並扣除該年度內該財產所產生的 50 美元行政和其他支出。您無法就捐贈的財產進行任何慈善捐贈扣除。
#### 第 36 行, 採購額減去支取以供個人使用的商品的成本
如果您是商家，請使用您為出售而購買的全部商品的成本。如果您是生產商或製造商，這包括為生產成品而購買的全部原材料或零件的成本。
**貿易折扣。**
商品的訂明價格和您支付這些商品的實際價格之間的差額，稱為貿易折扣。在計算採購成本時，您須使用您支付的價格（而非訂明的價格）。請不要在總收入中將折扣金額單獨顯示為一個項目。
汽車經銷商須記錄庫存汽車的成本，並減去任何生產商作為貿易折扣的回扣。
**現金折扣。**
現金折扣是您的供應商讓您從採購發票中扣除的金額，以便及時付款。有兩種現金折扣會計方法。您可將現金折扣記入獨立折扣帳戶的貸方，或從年內的總採購額中扣除。無論您使用哪種方法，都要貫徹使用。如果您想變更計算庫存成本的方法，您須提交 3115 表。如需了解更多資訊，請參閱第 2 章 _變更會計方法_ 。
如果您將現金折扣記入獨立帳戶的貸方，在稅務年度末，您須在營業收入中包含該貸方餘額。如果您使用這種方法，您不可透過現金折扣來降低您的銷貨成本。
**採購額退款和津貼。**
您須從年內的總採購額中扣除全部退款和津貼。
**從銷售中支取的商品。**
如果您支取商品以供個人或家庭使用，則必須從您購買用於銷售的商品總額中扣除該成本。請將您支取以供個人或家庭使用的商品的成本記入採購或銷售帳戶的貸方。您也須從您的提款帳戶中扣除該金額。 
提款帳戶是您應保留的獨立帳戶，用以記錄您為支付個人和家庭支出而提取的營業收入。如上所述，您也使用提款帳戶記錄供個人或家庭使用而支取的商品。該帳戶也稱為支取帳戶或個人帳戶。
#### 第 37 行, 人工成本
人工成本通常是僅存在於製造業或採礦業的銷貨成本元素。小型貿易商（批發商、零售商等）通常沒有可適當地計入銷貨成本的人工成本。在製造業務中，可適當地分配至銷貨成本的人工成本，包括把原材料造成可出售的成品所用的直接和間接人工。
**直接人工。**
直接人工成本是您向用全部時間直接處理待生產的產品的員工支付的工資。這些成本也包括向直接處理產品的兼職員工支付的一部分工資（如果您能確定這部分工資）。
**間接人工。**
間接人工成本是您向履行一般工廠職能的員工支付的工資，而這些職能與生產可出售的產品沒有任何即時或直接的關聯，但卻是生產流程必不可少的一環。
**其他人工。**
不可適當地計入銷貨成本的其他人工成本可以作為銷售或行政支出予以扣除。一般來說，可適當計入銷貨成本的幾類人工成本，是直接或間接人工成本，以及被視為已適當從生產流程中扣除的管理費用的若干其他成本，正如下文 _第 39 行，其他成本_ 所討論一樣。
#### 第 38 行, 物料和供應品
用於生產商品的物料和供應品（例如硬體和化學品）計入銷貨成本內。並非用於生產商品的物料和供應品被視為遞延支出。您在使用這些物料和供應品時，要作為營業費用予以扣除。營業費用會在 第 8 章中加以討論。
#### 第 39 行, 其他成本
在製造或採礦流程中產生、計入銷貨成本的其他成本舉例如下。
**容器。**
作為生產的產品一部分的容器及包裝是銷貨成本的一部分。如果容器及包裝不是生產的產品一部分，那麼這些成本就是運輸或銷售支出。
**進貨運費。**
您在生產中使用的原材料、供應品和您為出售而購買的商品的進貨運費、進貨快遞費和進貨搬運費，全都是銷貨成本的一部分。
**管理費用。**
管理費用包括租金、熱能、照明、電力、保險、折舊、稅務、維護、人工和監管等支出。您產生的作為製造業務的直接必要支出的管理費用計入您的銷貨成本中。
#### 第 40 行, 將第 35 行至第 39 行相加
第 35 行至第 39 行的總計等於年內可供出售商品的成本。
#### 第 41 行, 年末庫存
第 40 行減去您的年末庫存的價值（在適當的情況下，包括原材料和供應品成本、直接人工成本和管理費用的可分配部分） 。年末庫存也稱為期末或最後庫存。您的最後庫存通常會成為下一個稅務年度的年初庫存。
#### 第 42 行, 銷貨成本
當您以可供出售商品的成本減去期末庫存（年末庫存）時，餘額即該稅務年度內的銷貨成本。
