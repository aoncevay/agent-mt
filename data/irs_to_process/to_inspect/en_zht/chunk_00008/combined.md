#### Rule 9—Your Qualifying Child Cannot Be Used by More Than One Person To Claim the EIC
Sometimes a child meets the tests to be a qualifying child of more than one person. However, only one of these persons can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. Only that person can use the child as a qualifying child to take all of the following tax benefits (provided the person is eligible for each benefit).
  1. The child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit.
  2. Head of household filing status. 
  3. The credit for child and dependent care expenses.
  4. The exclusion for dependent care benefits.
  5. The EIC.
The other person can’t take any of these benefits based on this qualifying child. In other words, you and the other person can’t agree to divide these tax benefits between you. The other person can’t take any of these tax benefits unless that person has a different qualifying child. 
The tiebreaker rules, which follow, explain who, if anyone, can claim the EIC when more than one person has the same qualifying child. However, the tiebreaker rules don't apply if the other person is your spouse and you file a joint return.
**Tiebreaker rules.**
To determine which person can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the five tax benefits just listed, the following tiebreaker rules apply. For purposes of these tiebreaker rules, the term “parent” means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It does not include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.
  * If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.
  * If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.
  * If the parents don't file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher AGI for the year.
  * If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year.
  * If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent claims the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of the child's parents who can claim the child.
Subject to these tiebreaker rules, you and the other person may be able to choose which of you claims the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 1 through 12.
If you can’t claim the EIC because your qualifying child is treated under the tiebreaker rules as the qualifying child of another person for 2024, you may be able to take the EIC using a different qualifying child, or take the EIC using the rules in chapter 3 for people who don't have a qualifying child.
**If the other person cannot claim the EIC.**
If you and someone else have the same qualifying child but the other person can’t claim the EIC because the other person isn't eligible or their earned income or AGI is too high, you may be able to treat the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 6 and 7. But you can’t treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the EIC if the other person uses the child to claim any of the other five tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter.
**Examples.**
The following examples may help you in determining whether you can claim the EIC when you and someone else have the same qualifying child.
**Example 1—Child lived with parent and grandparent.**
You and your 2-year-old child Sam lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. Your only income was $9,000 from a part-time job. Your parent's only income was $22,000 from a job, and their AGI is $22,000. Your child’s other parent did not live with you or Sam. The special rule explained later for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply. Sam is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Sam meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only one of you can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and the other tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter for which that person qualifies). Sam isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, including the child’s other parent. If you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which your parent qualifies).
**Example 2—Parent has higher AGI than grandparent.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your AGI is $25,000. Because your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your parent can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only you can claim Sam.
**Example 3—Two persons claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you and your parent both claim Sam as a qualifying child. In this case, you as the child's parent will be the only one allowed to claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC and the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier based on Sam. Your parent can't take the EIC for a taxpayer without a qualifying child because your parent’s AGI is more than $18,591.
**Example 4—Qualifying children split between two persons.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you also have two other young children who are qualifying children of both you and your parent. Only one of you can claim each child. However, if your parent's AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your parent to claim one or more of the children. For example, if you claim one child, your parent can claim the other two.
**Example 5—Taxpayer who is a qualifying child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you are only 18 years old. This means you are a qualifying child of your parent. Because of _Rule 10_ , discussed next, you can’t claim the EIC and can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only your parent may be able to treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC. If your parent meets all the other requirements for claiming the EIC and you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can claim both you and Sam as qualifying children for the EIC.
**Example 6—Grandparent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that your parent earned $50,000 from employment. Because your parent's earned income is too high for your parent to claim the EIC, only you can claim the EIC using Sam.
**Example 7—Parent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you earned $50,000 from your job and your AGI is $50,500. Your earned income is too high for you to claim the EIC. But your parent can’t claim the EIC either, because your parent’s AGI isn't higher than yours.
**Example 8—Separated parents.**
You, your spouse, and your 10-year-old child, Jordan, lived together until August 1, 2024, when your spouse moved out of the household. In August and September, Jordan lived with you. For the rest of the year, Jordan lived with Jordan's other parent. Jordan is a qualifying child of both you and your spouse because Jordan lived with each of you for more than half the year and because Jordan met the relationship, age, and joint return tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written separation agreement, so the _Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_.") doesn't apply. 
You and your spouse will file separate returns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This means, if your spouse doesn't claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any of the tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any tax benefit listed earlier for which you qualify. However, you can't take the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and, while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet the requirements for certain separated spouses to take the EIC when they don’t file a joint return. See Rule 3. You also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.
**Example 9—Separated parents claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 8_ , except that you and your spouse both claim Jordan as a qualifying child. In this case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This is because, during 2024, Jordan lived with your spouse longer than with you. You can’t claim the EIC because you are a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return and you don’t have a qualifying child. However, your spouse's filing status is also married filing separately, so your spouse can’t claim the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 or you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn't meet the requirements to claim the EIC as a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return. See Rule 3. Your spouse also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your spouse’s filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.
**Example 10—Unmarried parents.**
You, your 5-year-old child, Logan, and Logan’s other parent lived together all year. You and Logan’s other parent aren't married. Logan is a qualifying child of both you and Logan’s other parent because Logan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and Logan’s other parent. Your earned income and AGI are $12,000, and Logan’s other parent’s earned income and AGI are $14,000. Neither of you had any other income. Logan’s other parent agrees to let you treat the child as a qualifying child. This means if Logan’s other parent doesn't claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify.
**Example 11—Unmarried parents claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 10_ except that you and Logan’s other parent both claim Logan as a qualifying child. In this case, only Logan’s other parent will be allowed to treat Logan as a qualifying child. This is because Logan’s other parent’s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, $12,000. You can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.
**Example 12—Child did not live with a parent.**
You and your sibling’s child, Morgan, lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your only income was from a part-time job. Your parent’s AGI is $15,000. Your parent’s only income was from a job. Morgan’s parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and don't live with you or Morgan. Morgan is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Morgan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only your parent can treat Morgan as a qualifying child. This is because your parent’s AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.
**Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).**
A child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all of the following statements are true.
  1. The parents:
    1. Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;
    2. Are separated under a written separation agreement; or
    3. Lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024.
  2. The child received over half of the child’s support for the year from the parents.
  3. The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of 2024.
  4. Either of the following statements is true.
    1. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that the custodial parent will not claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches the form or statement to their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. 
    2. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024.
For details, see Pub. 501. If a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under this special rule for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), only the noncustodial parent can claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents for the child. However, only the custodial parent, if eligible, or another eligible taxpayer can claim the child as a qualifying child for the EIC. For details and examples, see _Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_ in Pub. 501.

#### 規則 9—您的合資格子女不能被多人用於申報 EIC
有時，一個子女通過了成為多人的合資格子女的測試。然而，這些人當中只有一個人可以真正將子女視為合資格的子女。只有該人可以將子女作為合資格的子女來享有以下所有稅收優惠（前提是該人有資格獲得每項福利）。
  1. 子女稅優惠、其他被撫養人的優惠或額外的子女稅收優惠。
  2. 戶長報稅身份。
  3. 適用於子女和被撫養人的照護費用抵免。
  4. 被撫養人照護福利的排除。
  5. EIC 。
其他人不能基於這個合資格的子女獲得任何這些福利。換句話說，您和其他人不能約定在您們之間分配這些稅收優惠。其他人不能享受任何這些稅收優惠， 除非該人有不同的合資格的子女。 
下文的決勝局法則解釋了當不止一個人擁有相同的合資格的子女時，誰可以申報 EIC 。然而，如果其他人是您的配偶並且您們提交聯合報稅表，則決勝局法則不適用。
**決勝局法則。**
確定哪個人可以憑藉該子女的合條件子女身份來申請以上列出的五項稅收福利時，適用以下決勝局法則。出於這些決勝局法則的目的，「parent」(父母) 一詞是指個人的親生父母或收養父母。這不包括繼父母或養父母，除非該人收養了該子女。
  * 如果其中只有一人是該名子女的父母，則該子女被視為其父母的合資格的子女。
  * 如果父母一起提交聯合報稅表並且可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，則該子女將被視為其父母雙方的合資格子女。
  * 如果父母雙方沒有一起提交聯合報稅表，但父母雙方都將該子女申報為合資格的子女，國稅局會將該子女視為相關年度與該 子女同住時間較長的父母一方的合資格子女。如果子女與父母雙方居住的時間相同，國稅局會將子女視為相關年度調整後總收入 (AGI) 較高的父母一方的合資格子女。
  * 如果沒有父母可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，則該子女被視為相關年度 AGI 最高之人的合資格子女。
  * 如果父母可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，但沒有父母這樣做，則該子女被視為相關年度AGI 最高之人的合資格子女，但前提是該人的 AGI 高於可以將該子女申報為合資格子女的任何父母的最高 AGI。
根據這些決勝局法則，您和其他人可以選擇您們當中誰來將該名子女申報為合資格的子女。請參閱範例 1 至 範例 12。
如果您無法申報 EIC 是因為您的合資格子女在 2024 年依照決勝局法則被視為其他人的合資格子女，您可以憑藉不同的合資格子女申報 EIC ，或使用第 3 章中適用於沒有合資格子女的納稅人的規則。
**如果其他人無法申報 EIC 。**
如果您和其他人有同一個合資格的子女，但其他人因為不符合條件或其收入或 調整後總收入太高而無法申報 EIC ，您可以將子女視為合資格的子女。請參閱 範例 6  和 範例 7。然而，如果其他人憑藉子女來申報本章前面列出的其他五項稅收優惠中的任何一項，則您無法將子女視為合資格的子女來申報 EIC 。
**範例。**
以下範例可以幫助您判定當您和其他人有相同的合資格的子女時，您是否可以申報 EIC 。
**範例 1 - 子女與父母和祖父母同住。**
您和您 2 歲的子女 Sam 全年都與您父母同住。您 25 歲，未婚，您的 AGI 為 9,000 美元。您的唯一收入是兼職工作獲得的 9,000 美元。您父母的唯一收入是工作獲得的 22,000 美元，而其 AGI 是 22,000 美元。您子女的另一方父母未與您和 Sam 同住。下文介紹的適用於離異或分居父母的特殊規定不適用。 Sam 是您和您父母的合資格子女，因為 Sam 通過了針對您和您父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。但是，您和您父母只有一方可以憑藉其合資格子女身份來申報 EIC（以及本章上文列出的該人有資格享受的其他稅收福利）。 Sam 不屬於任何其他人的合條件子女，包括其另一方父母。如果您未為了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以憑藉其合資格子女身份來申報 EIC（以及上文列出的您父母有資格享受的任何其他稅收福利）。 
**範例 2—父母的調整後總收入高於祖父母。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您的 AGI 是 25,000 美元。因為您父母的 AGI 並不比您高，所以您父母不能將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。只有您可以將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。 
**範例 3—兩個人申報同一個子女。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和您父母同時將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，您作為 Sam 的父母將是唯一被允許為了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有資格享受的其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女的人。 IRS 將不允許您父母憑藉 Sam 來申報 EIC 以及上文列出的任何其他稅收福利。您父母不能享受無任何合資格子女的納稅人可享受的 EIC，因為您父母的 AGI 超過了 18,591 美元。 
**範例 4—合資格的子女分配給兩個人。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您還有另外兩個年幼的子女，他們都是您和您父母的合資格子女。每個子女僅供您和您父母中的一人申報為合資格子女。但是，如果您父母的 AGI 比您高，您可以讓您父母將一個或多個子女申報為合資格子女。例如，如果您將一個子女申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以將您另外兩個子女申報為合資格子女。 
**範例 5—納稅人是合資格的子女。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您只有 18 歲。這意味著您是您父母的合資格子女。根據接下來要討論的 _規則 10_ ，您不能申報 EIC，也不能將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。只有您父母可以憑藉 Sam 的合資格子女身份來申報 EIC。如果您父母符合申報 EIC 的所有其他要求，而您未為了享受上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以為了享受 EIC 而將您和 Sam 同時申報為合資格子女。 
**範例 6—祖父母的勞動所得過多而無法申報 EIC 。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您父母的工作收入是 50,000 美元。您父母因勞動所得太高而不能申報 EIC，因此只有您可以憑藉 Sam 申報 EIC。 
**範例 7—父母的勞動所得過多而無法申報 EIC 。**
事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您的工作收入是 50,000 美元，您的 AGI 是 50,500 美元。您因勞動所得太高而不能申報 EIC。但是您父母也不能申報 EIC，因為您父母的 AGI 並不比您高。 
**範例 8—分居的父母。**
您、您配偶和您 10 歲的子女 Jordan 一直同住，直到 2024 年 8 月 1 日您配偶搬出去。 8 月和 9 月，Jordan 和您同住。在這一年剩下的時間裡，Jordan 和您配偶（Jordan 的另一方父母）同住。 Jordan 同時是您和您配偶的合資格子女，因為 Jordan 和您們兩人都同住了半年以上的時間，而且 Jordan 通過了針對您們倆的關係、年齡和聯合報稅表測試。到年底時，您和您配偶仍未離異、合法分居或根據書面分居協議進行分居，因此 _離婚或分居的父母（或分開生活的父母）的特殊規定_ 不適用。 
您和您配偶將分別提交單獨報稅表。您配偶同意讓您將 Jordan 視為合資格子女。這意味著，如果您配偶未為了享受上文列出的任何稅收福利而將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女，則您可以為了享受上文列出的您有資格享受的任何稅收福利而將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女。但是，您不能獲取 EIC，因為您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分居，而且，雖然您們在 2024 年底確實分居，但您們並沒有根據書面分居協議或單獨撫養令合法分居。因此，您不符合某些分居配偶在不提交聯合報稅表的情況下享受 EIC 的要求。請參閱規則 3。您也不能享受子女和被撫養人護理費用抵免，因為您的申報身份是已婚分別申報，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住。請參閱 503 號刊物。 
**範例 9—分居父母申報同一個子女。**
事實與 _示例 8_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和您配偶同時將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，只有您配偶可以將 Jordan 視為合資格子女。這是因為，Jordan 在 2024 年與您配偶同住的時間比與您同住的時間長。您不能申報 EIC，因為您是沒有聯合報稅的分居配偶，而且您沒有一個合資格的子女。但是，您配偶的申報身份也是已婚分別申報，所以您配偶不能申報 EIC，因為您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住，或者您們沒有根據書面分居協議或分開撫養的法令合法分居。因此，您配偶作為沒有提交聯合報稅表的分居配偶，不符合申報 EIC 的要求。請參閱規則 3。您配偶也不能享受子女和被撫養人護理費用抵免，因為您配偶的申報身份是已婚分別申報，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住。請參閱 503 號刊物。 
**範例 10—未婚父母。**
您、您 5 歲的子女 Logan 以及您子女的另一方父母全年同住。您和 Logan 的另一方父母未婚。 Logan 是您和 Logan 的另一方父母的合資格子女，因為 Logan 通過了針對您和 Logan 另一方父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。您的勞動所得和 AGI 均為 12,000 美元，Logan 的另一方父母的勞動所得和 AGI 均為 14,000 美元。您們都沒有任何其他收入。 Logan 的另一方父母同意讓您將 Logan 視為合資格子女。這意味著，如果 Logan 的另一方父母沒有為了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Logan 申報為合資格子女，則您可以為了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有資格享受的任何其他稅收福利而將 Logan 申報為合資格子女。 
**範例 11—未婚父母申報同一個子女。**
事實與 _示例 10_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和 Logan 的另一方父母同時將 Logan 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，只有 Logan 的另一方父母可以將 Logan 視為合資格子女。這是因為其 AGI（14,000 美元）比您的 AGI（12,000 美元）高。您可以申請無任何合資格子女時可申請的 EIC。 
**範例 12—子女沒有和父母同住。**
您和您兄弟姐妹的子女 Morgan 全年都與您父母同住。您今年 25 歲，您的 AGI 為 9,300 美元。您唯一的收入來自兼職工作。您父母的 AGI 是 15,000 美元。您父母唯一的收入來自工作。 Morgan 的父母聯合報稅，他們的 AGI 低於 9,000 美元，並且他們不與您和 Morgan 同住。 Morgan 同時是您和您父母的合資格子女，因為 Morgan 通過了針對您和您父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。但是，只有您父母可以將 Morgan 視為合資格子女。這是因為您父母的 AGI（15,000 美元）比您的 AGI（9,300 美元）高。 
**離婚或分居父母（或分開生活的父母）的特殊規定。**
如果以下所有聲明均屬實，則子女將被視為其非監護父母的合資格子女。
  1. 父母：
    1. 根據離婚法令或分居贍養令離婚或合法分居;
    2. 根據書面分居協議分居; 或
    3. 在 2024 年的最後 6 個月內一直處於分居狀態。
  2. 子女在這一年裡從父母那裡得到了一半以上的支援。
  3. 子女在 2024 年的一半以上時間由父母一方或雙方監護。
  4. 以下任一聲明屬實。
    1. 監護父母簽署《表格 8332》或實質上類似的聲明，表明不會將子女申請為該年度的被撫養人，並且非監護父母將表格或聲明附於其申報表中。如果離婚法令或分居協議在 1984 年之後和 2009 年之前生效，非監護父母可以附上法令或協議中的某些頁面，而非《表格 8332》。
    2. 適用於 2024 年的 1985 年之前的離婚法令或單獨贍養費或書面分居協議，非監護父母可以將子女視為被撫養人，並且非監護父母在 2024 年期間至少提供 600 美元用於撫養子女。
如需了解詳情，請參閱 501 號刊物。如果子女根據離婚或分居父母（或分居的父母）的子女特殊規則被視為非監護父母的合資格的子女，則只有非監護父母可以申請子女稅收抵免或其他被撫養人的抵免。然而，只有監護父母（如符合條件）或其他符合條件的納稅人才能將子女申請為 EIC 的合資格的子女。有關詳細資訊和範例，請參閱501 號刊物中 _應用於離婚或分居父母（或分居的父母）的決勝局法則_ 。
