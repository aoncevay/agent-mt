## 3. Rules if You Do Not Have a Qualifying Child
Use this chapter if you don't have a qualifying child and have met all the rules in chapter 1. This chapter discusses _Rules 11_ through _14_. You must meet all four of these rules, in addition to the rules in chapters 1 and 4, to qualify for the EIC without a qualifying child. If you meet all the rules in chapter 1 and this chapter, read chapter 4 to find out what to do next.
**If you have a qualifying child.**
If you meet _Rule 8_ , you have a qualifying child. If you meet _Rule 8_ and don't claim the EIC with a qualifying child, you can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.
#### Rule 11—You Must Meet the Age Requirements
You must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. If you are married filing a joint return, either you or your spouse must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. It doesn't matter which spouse meets the age test, as long as one of the spouses does.
You meet the age test if you were born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000. If you are married filing a joint return, you meet the age test if either you or your spouse was born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000.
If neither you nor your spouse meets the age test, you can't claim the EIC. Enter "No" on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**Example 1.**
You are age 28 and unmarried. You meet the age test.
**Example 2—Spouse meets age test.**
You are married and filing a joint return. You are age 23 and your spouse is age 27. You meet the age test because your spouse is at least age 25 but under age 65.
**Death of spouse.**
If you are filing a joint return with your spouse who died in 2024, you meet the age test if you are at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024, or your spouse was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.
Your spouse is considered to reach age 25 on the day before their 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; your spouse reaches age 65 on their 65th birthday.
Even if your spouse was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.
_**Example 1.**_
You are married and filing a joint return with your spouse who died in August 2024. You are age 67. Your spouse would have become age 65 in November 2024. Because your spouse was under age 65 at the time of death, you meet the age test.
**Example 2.**
Your spouse was born on February 14, 1999, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 25 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 25 at the time of death and isn't at least age 25 at the end of 2024.
**Death of taxpayer.**
A taxpayer who died in 2024 meets the age test if the taxpayer was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.
A taxpayer is considered to reach age 25 on the day before the taxpayer’s 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; a taxpayer reaches age 65 on the taxpayer’s 65th birthday.
Even if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.
#### Rule 12—You Cannot Be the Dependent of Another Person
If you **aren't** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check the box under your name that says "Someone can claim you as a dependent."
If you **are** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check either box that says "Someone can claim you as a dependent" or "Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent."
If you aren't sure whether someone else can claim you as a dependent, get Pub. 501 and read the rules for claiming a dependent.
If someone else can claim you as a dependent on their return, but doesn't, you still can’t claim the credit unless the person who can claim you on their tax return isn't required to file an income tax return and doesn't file a tax return or files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
**Example 1.**
In 2024, you were age 25, single, and living at home with your parents. You worked and weren't a student. You earned $7,500. Your parents can’t claim you as a dependent. When you file your return, you do not check the "Someone can claim you as a dependent" checkbox. You meet this rule. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements.
**Example 2.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ , except that you earned $2,000. Your parents can claim you as a dependent but decide not to. You don't meet this rule. You can’t claim the credit because your parents could have claimed you as a dependent.
**Joint returns.**
You generally can’t be claimed as a dependent by another person if you are married and file a joint return.
However, another person may be able to claim you as a dependent if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be claimed as a dependent by another person if you claim the EIC on your joint return.
**Example 1—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**
You are 26 years old. You and your spouse live with your parents and had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. Neither you nor your spouse is required to file a tax return. You don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of your pay so you file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. Your parents aren't disqualified from claiming you as a dependent just because you filed a joint return.
**Example 2—Return filed to get EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except no taxes were taken out of your pay. Also, you and your spouse aren't required to file a tax return, but you file a joint return to claim an EIC of $63 and get a refund of that amount. Because claiming the EIC is your reason for filing the return, you aren't filing it only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. Your parents can’t claim you or your spouse as a dependent.
#### Rule 13—You Cannot Be a Qualifying Child of Another Taxpayer
You are a qualifying child of another taxpayer (your parent, guardian, foster parent, etc.) if all of the following statements are true.
  1. You are that person's son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them. Or, you are that person's brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them. 
  2. You were:
    1. Under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly);
    2. Under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly); or
    3. Permanently and totally disabled, regardless of age.
  3. You lived with that person in the United States for more than half of the year.
  4. You aren't filing a joint return for the year (or are filing a joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).
For more details about the tests to be a qualifying child, see Rule 8. 
If you are a qualifying child of another taxpayer, you can’t claim the EIC. This is true even if the person for whom you are a qualifying child doesn't claim the EIC or meet all of the rules to claim the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**Example.**
You lived with your parent all year. You are age 26, unmarried, and permanently and totally disabled. Your only income was from a community center where you went 3 days a week to answer telephones. You earned $5,000 for the year and provided more than half of your own support. Because you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests, you are a qualifying child of your parent for the EIC. Your parent can claim the EIC if your parent meets all the other requirements. Because you are a qualifying child of your parent, you can’t claim the EIC. This is so even if your parent can’t or doesn’t claim the EIC.
**Joint returns.**
You generally can’t be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you are married and file a joint return.
However, you may be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you claim the EIC on your joint return.
**Child of person not required to file a return.**
You aren't the qualifying child of another taxpayer (and so may qualify to claim the EIC) if the person for whom you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests isn't required to file an income tax return and either:
  * Doesn't file an income tax return, or
  * Files a return only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.
**Example 1—Return not required.**
You lived all year with your parent. You are 27 years old, unmarried, permanently and totally disabled, and earned $13,000. You have no other income, no children, and provided more than half of your own support. Your parent had no gross income, isn't required to file a 2024 tax return, and doesn't file a 2024 tax return. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.
**Example 2—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your parent had wages of $1,500 and had income tax withheld from wages. Your parent files a return only to get a refund of the income tax withheld and doesn't claim the EIC or any other tax credits or deductions. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.
**Example 3—Return filed to get EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 2_ except your parent claimed the EIC on their return. Since your parent filed the return to get the EIC, your parent isn't filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld. As a result, you are your parent’s qualifying child. You can’t claim the EIC.
#### Rule 14—You Must Have Lived in the United States More Than Half of the Year
Your home (and your spouse's if filing a joint return) must have been in the United States for more than half the year. 
If it wasn't, enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**United States.**
This means the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It doesn't include Puerto Rico or U.S. territories such as Guam.
**Homeless shelter.**
Your home can be any location where you regularly live. You don't need a traditional home. If you lived in one or more homeless shelters in the United States for more than half the year, you meet this rule. 
**Military personnel stationed outside the United States.**
U.S. military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty (defined in chapter 2) are considered to live in the United States during that duty period for purposes of the EIC.

## 3. 您沒有合資格的子女時的規則
如果您沒有合資格的子女並且符合第 1 章中的所有規則，請使用本章。本章討論 _規則 11_ 至 _14_ 。除了第 1 章和第 4 章中的規則外，您還必須滿足所有這四條規則，才有資格在沒有合資格的子女的情況下獲得 EIC 。如果您滿足第 1 章和本章中的所有規則，請閱讀第 4 章以了解下一步要做什麼。
**如果您有合資格的子女。**
如果您符合 _規則 8_ ，您有合資格的子女。如果您符合 _規則 8_ 並且未申請有合資格子女時可申請的 EIC ，您可以申請在沒有合資格子女時可申請的 EIC 。
#### 規則 11—您必須符合年齡要求
您必須在 2024 年底至少年滿 25 歲但未滿 65 歲。如果您是已婚並提交聯合報稅表，您或您的配偶在 2024 年底必須至少年滿 25 歲但未滿 65 歲。只要配偶之一符合年齡測試即可，究竟誰符合並不重要。 。
如果您在 1959 年 12 月 31 日之後和 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前的期間出生，您就符合年齡測試。如果您已婚並提交聯合報稅表，並且您或您的配偶中的任何一方在 1959 年 12 月 31 日之後和 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前的期間出生，您就符合年齡測試。
如果您和您的配偶都不符合年齡測試，則您不能申報 EIC。輸入 “No” (否) 在第 27 行（表格 1040 或 1040-SR）旁邊的虛線上。
**範例 1。**
您今年 28 歲，未婚。您符合年齡測試。
**範例 2——配偶符合年齡測試。**
您已婚並提交聯合報稅表。您年滿 23 歲，您的配偶年滿 27 歲。您符合年齡測試，因為您的配偶年滿 25 歲但未滿 65 歲。
**配偶過世。**
如果您與 2024 年過世的配偶一起聯合報稅，如果您在 2024 年底至少 25 歲但未滿 65 歲，或您的配偶在去世時至少 25 歲但未滿 65 歲，您就符合年齡測試。 
您的配偶在 25 歲生日的前一天被視為年滿 25 歲。但是，達到 65 歲的規則不同；您的配偶在 65 歲生日時是年滿 65 歲。 
即使您的配偶出生於 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前，到 2024 年底您的配偶也不會被視為至少 25 歲，除非您的配偶在去世的時候至少年滿 25 歲。 
_**範例 1。**_
您是已婚人士，與 2024 年 8 月去世的配偶聯合報稅。您的年齡是 67 歲。您的配偶會在 2024 年 11 月滿 65 歲。因為您的配偶去世時未滿 65 歲，所以您符合年齡測試的要求。 
**範例 2。**
您的配偶於 1999 年 2 月 14 日出生，並於 2024 年 2 月 13 日死亡。您的配偶在死亡時被認為是 25 歲。但是，如果您的配偶在 2024 年 2 月 12 日死亡，您的配偶在死亡時不被視為是 25 歲，在 2024 年底也不是至少年滿 25 歲。 
**納稅人過世。**
在 2024 年過世的納稅人符合年齡測試，如果該納稅人在死亡時至少為 25 歲，但不滿 65 歲。 
納稅人在其 25 歲生日的前一天被視為年滿 25 歲。但是，達到 65 歲的規則不同；納稅人在其 65 歲生日時達到 65 歲。 
即使納稅人出生於 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前，他們在 2024 年底也不會被視為至少 25 歲，除非他們在死亡時至少 25 歲。 
#### 規則 12—您不能是其他人的被撫養人
如果您**不是** 提交聯合報稅表，並且您 **沒有** 勾選您姓名下的「其他人可以將您申報為被撫養人」的方塊，則您符合此規則。
如果您 **是** 提交聯合報稅表，並且您 **沒有** 勾選「其他人可以將您申報為被撫養人」或「其他人可以將您配偶申報為被撫養人」的方塊，則您符合此規則。
如果您不確定其他人是否可以將您申報為被撫養人，請取得 501 號刊物並閱讀申報被撫養人的規則。
如果其他人可以在其報稅表中將您申報為被撫養人但未這樣做，您仍然無法申報抵免, 除非可以在報稅表上申報您的人不需要申報個人所得稅，也不報稅，或者報稅只是為了要求退還預扣的所得稅或已付的預估稅款。
**範例 1。**
2024 年，您 25 歲，單身，與父母同住。您已就業且不是學生。您賺了 7,500 美元。您的父母無法申報您作為被撫養人。當您提交申報表時，您並未勾選「其他人可以將您申報為被撫養人」核取方塊。您符合這個規則。如果您符合所有其他要求，您可以申報 EIC 。
**範例 2。**
事實條件與 _範例 1 相同_ ，除了您賺了 2,000 美元。您的父母可以申報您為被撫養人，但決定不這麼做。您不符合這個規則。您無法申報抵免，因為您的父母原本可以將您申報為被撫養人。
**聯合報稅表。**
如果您已婚並提交聯合報稅表，您通常無法被其他人申報為被撫養人。
然而，如果您和您的配偶提交聯合報稅表只是為了要求退還預扣所得稅或繳付的估算稅款，則其他人可能可以申報您為被撫養人。然而，如果您在聯合申報時申請 EIC ，則您和您的配偶都無法被其他人申報為被撫養人。
**範例 1 - 提交報稅表以申請退還預扣稅款。**
您今年 26 歲。您和您的配偶與您的父母同住，從兼職工作中獲得 800 美元的薪資，沒有其他收入。您和您的配偶都不需要提交報稅表。您沒有子女。稅款從您的薪資中扣除，因此您提交聯合報稅表只是為了要求退還預扣稅款。您的父母不會僅僅因為您提交了聯合報稅表而被取消申報您作為被撫養人的資格。
**範例 2 - 提交報稅表以獲得 EIC 。**
事實與 _範例 1 相同，_ 不同的是未從您的報酬中扣除任何稅款。此外，您和您的配偶不需要提交報稅表，但您提交聯合申報表以申請 63 美元的 EIC 並獲得該金額的退款。因為申報 EIC 是您提交報稅表的原因，所以您提交報稅表並不是為了申請退還預扣所得稅或已付的預估稅款。您的父母不能將您或您的配偶申報為被撫養人。
#### 規則 13—您不能是其他納稅人的合資格子女
如果以下所有聲明均屬實，則您是其他納稅人（您的父母、監護人、養父母等）的合資格的子女。
  1. 您是此人的兒子、女兒、繼子女、寄養子女或他們當中任何一個的後代。您是那個人的兄弟、姐妹、同父異母（或同母異父）的兄弟、同父異母（或同母異父）的姐妹、繼兄弟、繼姐妹或其中任何一個的後代。 
  2. 您是：
    1. 年底未滿 19 歲且比此人（或此人的配偶，如果此人聯合申報）還年輕；
    2. 年底未滿 24 歲，學生，且比此人（或此人的配偶，如果此人聯合申報）還年輕；或
    3. 不論年齡，永久和完全殘障。
  3. 您和此人在美國同住了半年以上。
  4. 您在該納稅年度沒有提交聯合報稅表（或僅為了要求退還預扣所得稅或繳付的估算稅款而聯合申報）。
有關成為合資格子女的測試的更多詳細資訊，請參閱規則 8 。 
如果您是其他納稅人的合資格子女，則無法申請 EIC 。即使是使您成為其合資格子女的人沒有申請 EIC 或符合申請 EIC 的所有規則，情況也是如此。請在第 27 行 （《表格 1040》或《表格 1040-SR》）旁邊的虛線上輸入「No」（否）。
**範例。**
您整年都和您父母同住。您今年 26 歲，未婚，並且永久和完全殘障。您唯一的收入來自社區中心，您每週去那裡接聽電話三天。您該年度賺了 5,000 美元，並為自己提供了一半以上的生活費。因為您符合關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試，所以您是您父母符合 EIC 的合資格子女。如果您父母符合所有其他要求，您父母可以申請 EIC 。因為您是您父母的合資格子女，您無法申請 EIC 。即使您的父母無法或不申請 EIC ，情況也是如此。
**聯合報稅表。**
如果您已婚並提交聯合報稅表，您通常無法成為其他納稅人的合資格子女。
然而，如果您和您的配偶提交聯合報稅表只是為了要求退還預扣所得稅或繳付的估算稅款，您可能可以是其他納稅人的合資格子女。然而，如果您在聯合申報時申請 EIC ，您和您的配偶都無法成為其他納稅人的合資格子女。
**不需要報稅的人的子女。**
如果您符合關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試而不需要提交所得稅申報表，並且符合如下情況，則您不是其他納稅人的合資格子女（因此可能有資格申請 EIC ） ：
  * 不提交所得稅申報表，或
  * 提交報稅表只是為了要求退還預扣所得稅或已付的預估稅款。
**範例 1—不需要提交報稅表。**
您和您父母同住了一整年。您今年 27 歲，未婚，並且永久和完全殘障，賺了 13,000 美元。您沒有其他收入，沒有子女，並為自己提供了一半以上的生活費。您的父母沒有總收入，不需要提交 2024 年納稅申報表，也沒有提交 2024 年納稅申報表。因此，您不是您父母的合資格子女。如果您符合所有其他要求，您可以申請 EIC 。
**範例 2 - 提交報稅表以要求退還預扣稅款。**
事實與 _範例 1 相同，_ 不同的是您父母的薪資是 1,500 美元，並且已從您父母的薪資中扣除所得稅。您父母提交報稅表只是為了要求退還預扣稅款，並且沒有申請 EIC 或任何其他稅收抵免或扣除。因此，您不是您父母的合資格子女。如果您符合所有其他要求，您可以申請 EIC 。
**範例 3 - 提交報稅表以獲得 EIC 。**
事實與 _範例 2 中的相同，_ 除了您父母在報稅表中申請了 EIC 。由於您父母提交報稅表是為了獲得 EIC ，並不是為了要求退還預扣稅款。因此，您是您父母的合資格子女。您無法申請 EIC 。
#### 規則 14—您必須已在美國生活半年以上
您（和您配偶，如果提交聯合報稅表）必須在美國的 住所居住了半年以上。 
如果不是，請在第 27 行 （《表格 1040》或《表格 1040-SR》）旁邊的虛線上輸入「No」(否)。
**美國。**
這指的是 50 州和哥倫比亞特區。不包含波多黎各或美國領土，例如關島。
**遊民收容所。**
您的住居可以是您經常居住的任何地方。您不需要一個傳統的住居。如果您在美國的一個或多個遊民收容所住了半年以上，您即符合此規則。 
**駐紮在美國境外的軍事人員。**
出於 EIC 的目的，駐紮在美國境外並延長現役（定義於第 2 章）的美國軍事人員被視為在該服役期間居住在美國。
