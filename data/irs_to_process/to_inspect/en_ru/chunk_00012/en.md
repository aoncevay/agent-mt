## 6. Detailed Examples
The next few pages contain two detailed examples that may be helpful if you have questions about claiming the EIC.
#### Example 1—Jamie Smith
Jamie Smith is age 63 and retired. Jamie received $7,000 in social security benefits during the year and $17,000 from a part-time job. Jamie also received a taxable pension of $7,400. Jamie had no other income. Jamie’s AGI on line 11 of Form 1040 is $24,400 ($17,000 + $7,400).
Jamie isn't married and lived alone in the United States for the entire year. Jamie can’t be claimed as a dependent on anyone else's return, doesn’t have any investment income, and doesn’t have a qualifying child.
Jamie reads the steps for eligibility in the Form 1040 instructions. In _Step 1_ , Jamie discovers that, because Jamie’s AGI ($24,400) isn't less than $18,591, Jamie can’t take the EIC. Jamie completes the rest of Form 1040 and files it with the IRS.
#### Example 2—Cameron and Jordan Grey
Cameron and Jordan Grey have two children, ages 10 and 8. The children lived with them for all of 2024. Cameron earned wages of $15,000 and Jordan had wages of $18,030. The Greys received $525 in interest on their savings account. They had no other income in 2024.
Cameron and Jordan have the 2024 Form 1040 and instructions. They want to see if they qualify for the EIC, so they follow the steps for Line 27 in the Instructions for Form 1040.
**Step 1.**
The amount Cameron and Jordan entered on Form 1040, line 11, was $33,555. They both have valid SSNs, which they have had for many years. They are married and will file a joint return. Neither Cameron nor Jordan is a nonresident alien. Therefore, the answers they give to the questions in _Step 1_ allow them to proceed to _Step 2_. 
**Step 2.**
The only investment income the Greys have is their $525 interest income. That amount isn't more than $11,600, so they answer “No” to the second question in _Step 2_ and go to _Step 3_.
**Step 3.**
Their children meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests to be Cameron and Jordan's qualifying children, so Cameron and Jordan answer “Yes” to the first question in _Step 3_. Their children aren't qualifying children of anyone else. Both children have valid SSNs, which they received soon after birth. Cameron and Jordan are filing a joint return, so they answer “Yes” to the second question in _Step 3_. This means they can skip questions 3 though 6 and _Step 4_ and go to _Step 5_.
**Step 5.**
Cameron and Jordan figure their earned income to be $33,030, the amount of their combined wages. This is less than $62,688, so they go to _Step 6_ to figure their credit.
**Step 6.**
Cameron and Jordan want to figure their EIC themselves, so they complete the EIC Worksheet in the Form 1040 instructions.
**Completing the EIC Worksheet.**
Cameron and Jordan complete their worksheet as follows.
  1. Cameron and Jordan enter their total earned income ($33,030) on line 1.
  2. To find their credit, they go to the EIC Table. They find their earned income of $33,030 in the range of $33,000 to $33,050. Because both of their children have valid SSNs, they follow this line across to the column for 2 children under _Married filing jointly_ and find $6,247. They enter $6,247 on line 2.
  3. They enter on line 3 their AGI ($33,555) and see that it is different from the amount on line 1.
  4. They look up $33,555 in the EIC Table and enter the amount of $6,131 on line 5.
  5. They enter $6,131 on line 6. This is the smaller of the line 2 amount ($6,247) and the line 5 amount ($6,131).
  6. The Greys enter $6,131 on line 27 of their Form 1040. They will now complete Schedule EIC and attach it to their return. They will keep the EIC Worksheet for their records.
