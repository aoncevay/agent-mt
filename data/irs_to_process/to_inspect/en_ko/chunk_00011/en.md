## 4. Figuring and Claiming the EIC
You must meet one more rule to claim the EIC.
You need to know the amount of your earned income to see if you meet the rule in this chapter. You also need to know that amount to figure your EIC.
#### Rule 15—Earned Income Limits
Your earned income must be less than:
  * $59,899 ($66,819 for married filing jointly) if you have three or more qualifying children who have valid SSNs,
  * $55,768 ($62,688 for married filing jointly) if you have two qualifying children who have valid SSNs,
  * $49,084 ($56,004 for married filing jointly) if you have one qualifying child who has a valid SSN, or
  * $18,591 ($25,511 for married filing jointly) if you don't have a qualifying child who has a valid SSN.
#### Earned Income
Earned income generally means wages, salaries, tips, other taxable employee pay, and net earnings from self-employment. Employee pay is earned income only if it is taxable. Nontaxable employee pay, such as certain dependent care benefits and adoption benefits, isn't earned income. But there is an exception for nontaxable combat pay, which you can choose to include in earned income. Earned income is explained in detail in _Rule 7_ in chapter 1. 
**Figuring earned income.**
If you are self-employed, a statutory employee, or a member of the clergy or a church employee who files Schedule SE (Form 1040), you will figure your earned income by using the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27 and then filling out Part 4 of EIC Worksheet B in the Form 1040 instructions. Be sure to see _Clergy_ or _Church employees_, whichever applies, before completing the worksheet in _Step 5_. 
_**Clergy.**_
If you are a member of the clergy who files Schedule SE and the amount on line 2 of that schedule includes an amount that was also reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, subtract that amount from the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, and enter the result on line 1 of the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27. Enter “Clergy” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). 
_**Church employees.**_
A church employee means an employee (other than a minister or member of a religious order) of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that is exempt from employer social security and Medicare taxes. If you received wages as a church employee and included any amount on both line 5a of Schedule SE and Form 1040, line 1a, subtract that amount from the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, and enter the result on line 1 of the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27. 
_**Medicaid waiver payments.**_
When completing the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions, line 27, enter the Medicaid waiver payments you excluded from income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8s, unless you choose to include these amounts in earned income, in which case enter -0-. For more information about these payments, see Pub. 525.
_**Nontaxable combat pay.**_
You can elect to include your nontaxable combat pay in earned income for the EIC. If you make the election, you must include in earned income all nontaxable combat pay you received.
If you are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received nontaxable combat pay, you can each make your own election. In other words, if one of you makes the election, the other one can also make it but doesn't have to.
The amount of your nontaxable combat pay should be shown on your Form W-2 in box 12 with code Q.
Electing to include nontaxable combat pay in earned income may increase or decrease your EIC. Figure the credit with and without your nontaxable combat pay before making the election. Whether the election increases or decreases your EIC depends on your total earned income, filing status, and number of qualifying children. If your earned income without your combat pay is less than the amount shown below for your number of children, you may benefit from electing to include your nontaxable combat pay in earned income and you should figure the credit both ways. If your earned income without your combat pay is equal to or more than these amounts, you will not benefit from including your combat pay in your earned income.
  * $8,260 if you have no children who have valid SSNs.
  * $12,390 if you have one child who has a valid SSN.
  * $17,400 if you have two or more children who have valid SSNs.
#### IRS Will Figure the EIC for You
The IRS will figure your EIC for you if you follow the instructions for Line 27 in the Instructions for Form 1040.
#### How To Figure the EIC Yourself
To figure the EIC yourself, use the EIC Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040. If you have a qualifying child, complete Schedule EIC (discussed later in this chapter) and attach it to your tax return.
If you want the IRS to figure your EIC for you, see _IRS Will Figure the EIC for You_, earlier.
#### Special Instructions—EIC Worksheets
You will need to decide whether to use EIC Worksheet A or EIC Worksheet B to figure the amount of your EIC. This section explains how to use these worksheets and how to report the EIC on your return.
**EIC Worksheet A.**
Use EIC Worksheet A if you weren’t self-employed at any time in 2024 and aren't a member of the clergy, a church employee who files Schedule SE, or a statutory employee filing Schedule C. 
**EIC Worksheet B.**
Use EIC Worksheet B if you were self-employed at any time in 2024 or are a member of the clergy, a church employee who files Schedule SE, or a statutory employee filing Schedule C. If any of the following situations apply to you, read the paragraph and then complete EIC Worksheet B. 
_**Net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.**_
If your net earnings from self-employment are $400 or more, be sure to correctly fill out Schedule SE (Form 1040) and pay the proper amount of self-employment tax. If you don't, you may not get all the EIC you are entitled to receive. 
_**When to use the optional methods of figuring net earnings.**_
Using the optional methods on Schedule SE to figure your net earnings from self-employment may qualify you for the EIC or give you a larger credit. If your net earnings (without using the optional methods) are less than $6,920, see the Instructions for Schedule SE for details about the optional methods. 
_**When both spouses have self-employment income.**_
You must complete both Parts 1 and 2 of EIC Worksheet B if all of the following conditions apply to you.
  1. You are married filing a joint return.
  2. Both you and your spouse have income from self-employment.
  3. You or your spouse file a Schedule SE and the other spouse doesn't file Schedule SE. 
**Statutory employees.**
Statutory employees report wages and expenses on Schedule C. They don't file Schedule SE. If you are a statutory employee, enter the amount from line 1 of Schedule C in Part 3 when you complete EIC Worksheet B. 
#### Schedule EIC
You must complete Schedule EIC and attach it to your tax return if you have a qualifying child and are claiming the EIC. Schedule EIC provides the IRS with information about your qualifying children, including their names, ages, SSNs, relationship to you, and the amount of time they lived with you during the year.
