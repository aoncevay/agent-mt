#### How To Get Tax Help
If you have questions about a tax issue, need help preparing your tax return, or want to download free publications, forms, or instructions, go to IRS.gov and find resources that can help you right away.
**Preparing and filing your tax return.**
Find free options to prepare and file your return on IRS.gov or in your local community if you qualify.
The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax help to people who generally make $54,000 or less, persons with disabilities, and limited-English-speaking taxpayers who need help preparing their own tax returns. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program offers free tax help for all taxpayers, particularly those who are 60 years of age and older. TCE volunteers specialize in answering questions about pensions and retirement-related issues unique to seniors.
You can go to IRS.gov to see your options for preparing and filing your return which include the following.
  * **Free File.** Go to IRS.gov/FreeFile. See if you qualify to use brand-name software to prepare and _e-file_ your federal tax return for free.

View it online in HTML, as a PDF, or download it to your mobile device as an eBook.
  * You may also be able to access tax law information in your electronic filing software.
**Getting tax forms and publications.**
Go to IRS.gov/Forms to view, download, or print all of the forms and publications you may need. You can also download and view popular tax publications and instructions (including the 1040 instructions) on mobile devices as an eBook at no charge. Or, you can go to IRS.gov/OrderForms to place an order and have forms mailed to you within 10 business days.
**Access your online account (Individual taxpayers only).**
Go to IRS.gov/Account to securely access information about your federal tax account.

  * Access your tax records online.
  * Review the past 18 months of your payment history.
  * Go to IRS.gov/SecureAccess to review the required identity authentication process.
**Using direct deposit.**
The fastest way to receive a tax refund is to combine direct deposit and IRS _e-file_. Direct deposit securely and electronically transfers your refund directly into your financial account. Eight in 10 taxpayers use direct deposit to receive their refund. IRS issues more than 90% of refunds in less than 21 days.
**Delayed refund for returns claiming certain credits.**
Due to changes in the law, the IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February 2018, for returns that properly claimed the earned income credit (EIC) or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits.
**Getting a transcript or copy of a return.**
The quickest way to get a copy of your tax transcript is to go to IRS.gov/Transcripts. Click on either "Get Transcript Online" or "Get Transcript by Mail" to order a copy of your transcript. If you prefer, you can:
  * Order your transcript by calling 1-800-908-9946.
  * Mail Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (both available on IRS.gov).
**Using online tools to help prepare your return.**
Go to IRS.gov/Tools for the following.
  * The Earned Income Tax Credit Assistant (IRS.gov/EIC) determines if you’re eligible for the EIC.
  * The Online EIN Application (IRS.gov/EIN) helps you get an employer identification number.
  * The IRS Withholding Calculator (IRS.gov/W4App) estimates the amount you should have withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax purposes.
  * The First Time Homebuyer Credit Account Look-up (IRS.gov/HomeBuyer) tool provides information on your repayments and account balance.
  * The Sales Tax Deduction Calculator (IRS.gov/SalesTax) figures the amount you can claim if you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), choose not to claim state and local income taxes, and you didn’t save your receipts showing the sales tax you paid.
**Resolving tax-related identity theft issues.**
  * The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email or telephone to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels.
  * Go to IRS.gov/IDProtection for information and videos.
  * If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, visit IRS.gov/ID to learn what steps you should take.
**Checking on the status of your refund.**
  * Go to IRS.gov/Refunds.
  * Due to changes in the law, the IRS can’t issue refunds before mid-February 2018, for returns that properly claimed the EIC or the ACTC. This applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associated with these credits.
  * Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status.
  * Call the automated refund hotline at 1-800-829-1954. 
**Making a tax payment.**
The IRS uses the latest encryption technology to ensure your electronic payments are safe and secure. You can make electronic payments online, by phone, and from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money order. Go to IRS.gov/Payments to make a payment using any of the following options.
  * IRS Direct Pay: Pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you.
  * **Debit or credit card:** Choose an approved payment processor to pay online, by phone, and by mobile device.
  * **Electronic Funds Withdrawal:** Offered only when filing your federal taxes using tax preparation software or through a tax professional.
  * **Electronic Federal Tax Payment System:** Best option for businesses. Enrollment is required.
  * **Check or money order:** Mail your payment to the address listed on the notice or instructions.
  * **Cash:** You may be able to pay your taxes with cash at a participating retail store.
**What if I can’t pay now?**
Go to IRS.gov/Payments for more information about your options.
  * Apply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can’t pay your taxes in full today. Once you complete the online process, you will receive immediate notification of whether your agreement has been approved.
  * Use the Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier (IRS.gov/OIC) to see if you can settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe.
**Checking the status of an amended return.**
Go to IRS.gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040X amended returns. Please note that it can take up to 3 weeks from the date you mailed your amended return for it to show up in our system and processing it can take up to 16 weeks.
**Understanding an IRS notice or letter.**
Go to IRS.gov/Notices to find additional information about responding to an IRS notice or letter.
**Contacting your local IRS office.**
Keep in mind, many questions can be answered on IRS.gov without visiting an IRS Tax Assistance Center (TAC). Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for the topics people ask about most. If you still need help, IRS TACs provide tax help when a tax issue can’t be handled online or by phone. All TACs now provide service by appointment so you’ll know in advance that you can get the service you need without long wait times. Before you visit, go to IRS.gov/TACLocator to find the nearest TAC, check hours, available services, and appointment options. Or, on the IRS2Go app, under the Stay Connected tab, choose the Contact Us option and click on “Local Offices.”
**Watching IRS videos.**
The IRS Video portal (IRSvideos.gov) contains video and audio presentations for individuals, small businesses, and tax professionals.
**Getting tax information in other languages.**
For taxpayers whose native language isn’t English, we have the following resources available. Taxpayers can find information on IRS.gov in the following languages.
  * Spanish (IRS.gov/Spanish).
  * Chinese (IRS.gov/Chinese).
  * Vietnamese (IRS.gov/Vietnamese).
  * Korean (IRS.gov/Korean).
