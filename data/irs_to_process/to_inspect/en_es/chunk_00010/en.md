#### Form Required
Use IRS Form 2848 to appoint a recognized representative to act on your behalf before the IRS. Individuals recognized to represent you before the IRS are listed under _Part II, Declaration of Representative,_ of Form 2848. Your representative must complete that part of the form.
**Non-IRS powers of attorney.**
The IRS will accept a non-IRS power of attorney, but a completed Form 2848 must be attached in order for the power of attorney to be entered on the Centralized Authorization File (CAF) system. For more information, see  _Processing a non-IRS power of attorney_ , later. 
If you want to use a document other than Form 2848 to authorize the representation, it must contain the following information. 
  * Your name and mailing address.
  * Your social security number (or your individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN)) and/or employer identification number.
  * Your employee plan number, if applicable.
  * The name and mailing address of your representative(s).
  * The types of tax involved.
  * The federal tax form number.
  * The specific year(s) or period(s) involved.
  * For estate tax matters, the decedent's date of death.
  * A clear expression of your intention concerning the scope of authority granted to your representative(s).
  * Your signature and date.
You also must attach to the non-IRS power of attorney a signed and dated statement made by your representative. This statement, which is referred to as the Declaration of Representative, is contained in Part II of Form 2848. The statement should read: 
  1. I am not currently under suspension or disbarment from practice before the Internal Revenue Service or other practice of my profession by any other authority,
  2. I am subject to regulations contained in Circular 230 (31 C.F.R., Subtitle A, Part 10) as amended, governing practice before the Internal Revenue Service,
  3. I am authorized to represent the taxpayer(s) identified in the power of attorney, and
  4. I am a (naming the capacity in which representation is undertaken, as set forth in the list of eligible representatives at Part II of Form 2848.)
_**Required information missing.**_
The IRS will not accept your non-IRS power of attorney if it does not contain all the information listed above. You can sign and submit a completed Form 2848 or a new non-IRS power of attorney that contains all the information. If you cannot sign an acceptable replacement document, your attorney-in-fact may be able to perfect (make acceptable to the IRS) your non-IRS power of attorney by using the procedure described next. 
_**Procedure for perfecting a non-IRS power of attorney.**_
Under the following conditions, the attorney-in-fact named in your non-IRS power of attorney can sign a Form 2848 on your behalf. 
  1. The original non-IRS power of attorney grants authority to handle federal tax matters (for example, general authority to perform any acts).
  2. The attorney-in-fact attaches a statement (signed under penalty of perjury) to the Form 2848 stating that the original non-IRS power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction.
**Example.**
John Elm, a taxpayer, signs a non-IRS durable power of attorney that names his neighbor and CPA, Ed Larch, as his attorney-in-fact. The power of attorney grants Ed the authority to perform any and all acts on John's behalf. However, it does not list specific tax-related information such as types of tax or tax form numbers.
Shortly after John signs the power of attorney, he is declared incompetent. Later, a federal tax matter arises concerning a prior year return filed by John. Ed attempts to represent John before the IRS but is rejected because the durable power of attorney does not contain required information.
If Ed attaches a statement (signed under the penalty of perjury) that the durable power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction, he can sign a completed Form 2848 and submit it on John's behalf. If Ed can practice before the IRS (see  _Who Can Practice Before the IRS_ , earlier), he can name himself as representative on Form 2848. Otherwise, he must name another individual who can practice before the IRS.
_**Processing a non-IRS power of attorney.**_
The IRS has a centralized computer database system called the CAF system. This system contains information on the authority of taxpayer representatives. Generally, when you submit a power of attorney document to the IRS, it is processed for inclusion on the CAF system. Entry of your power of attorney on the CAF system enables IRS personnel, who do not have a copy of your power of attorney, to verify the authority of your representative by accessing the CAF. It also enables the IRS to automatically send copies of notices and other IRS communications to your representative if you specify that your representative should receive those communications.
You can have your non-IRS power of attorney entered on the CAF system by attaching it to a completed Form 2848 and submitting it to the IRS. Your signature is not required; however, your attorney-in-fact must sign the _Declaration of Representative_(see Part II of Form 2848).
