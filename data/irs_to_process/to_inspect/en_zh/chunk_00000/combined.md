## 6. How To Figure Cost of Goods Sold
#### Introduction
If you make or buy goods to sell, you can deduct the cost of goods sold from your gross receipts on Schedule C. However, to determine these costs, you must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year.
This chapter applies to you if you are a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer or if you are engaged in any business that makes, buys, or sells goods to produce income. This chapter does not apply to a personal service business, such as the business of a doctor, lawyer, carpenter, or painter. However, if you work in a personal service business and also sell or charge for the materials and supplies normally used in your business, this chapter applies to you.
#### Figuring Cost of Goods Sold on Schedule C, Lines 35 Through 42
Figure your cost of goods sold by filling out lines 35 through 42 of Schedule C. These lines are reproduced below and are explained in the discussion that follows.
**35** | Inventory at beginning of year. If different from last year's closing inventory, attach explanation | _____  
---|---|---  
**36** | Purchases less cost of items withdrawn for personal use | _____  
**37** | Cost of labor. Do not include any amounts paid to yourself | _____  
**38** | Materials and supplies | _____  
**39** | Other costs |   
**40** | Add lines 35 through 39 | _____  
**41** | Inventory at end of year |   
**42** | **Cost of goods sold.** Subtract line 41 from line 40. Enter the result here and on line 4 |   
#### Line 35—Inventory at Beginning of Year
If you are a merchant, beginning inventory is the cost of merchandise on hand at the beginning of the year that you will sell to customers. If you are a manufacturer or producer, it includes the total cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and materials and supplies used in manufacturing the goods (see _Inventories_ in chapter 2).
Opening inventory will usually be identical to the closing inventory of the year before. You must explain any difference in a schedule attached to your return.
**Donation of inventory.**
If you contribute inventory (property that you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can claim as a contribution deduction is the smaller of its fair market value on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of donated inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold.
If the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year.
A special rule may apply to certain donations of food inventory. See Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.
**Example 1.**
You are a calendar year taxpayer who uses an accrual method of accounting. In 2024, you contributed property from inventory to a church. It had a fair market value of $600. The closing inventory at the end of 2023 properly included $400 of costs due to the acquisition of the property, and in 2023, you properly deducted $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property as business expenses. The charitable contribution allowed for 2024 is $400 ($600 − $200). The $200 is the amount that would be ordinary income if you had sold the contributed inventory at fair market value on the date of the gift. The cost of goods sold you use in determining gross income for 2024 must not include the $400. You remove that amount from opening inventory for 2024.
**Example 2.**
If, in _Example 1_ , you acquired the contributed property in 2024 at a cost of $400, you would include the $400 cost of the property in figuring the cost of goods sold for 2024 and deduct the $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property for that year. You would not be allowed any charitable contribution deduction for the contributed property.
#### Line 36—Purchases Less Cost of Items Withdrawn for Personal Use
If you are a merchant, use the cost of all merchandise you bought for sale. If you are a manufacturer or producer, this includes the cost of all raw materials or parts purchased for manufacture into a finished product.
**Trade discounts.**
The differences between the stated prices of articles and the actual prices you pay for them are called trade discounts. You must use the prices you pay (not the stated prices) in figuring your cost of purchases. Do not show the discount amount separately as an item in gross income.
An automobile dealer must record the cost of a car in inventory reduced by any manufacturer's rebate that represents a trade discount. 
**Cash discounts.**
Cash discounts are amounts your suppliers let you deduct from your purchase invoices for prompt payments. There are two methods of accounting for cash discounts. You can either credit them to a separate discount account or deduct them from total purchases for the year. Whichever method you use, you must be consistent. If you want to change your method of figuring inventory cost, you must file Form 3115. For more information, see _Change in Accounting Method_ in chapter 2.
If you credit cash discounts to a separate account, you must include this credit balance in your business income at the end of the tax year. If you use this method, do not reduce your cost of goods sold by the cash discounts.
**Purchase returns and allowances.**
You must deduct all returns and allowances from your total purchases during the year.
**Merchandise withdrawn from sale.**
If you withdraw merchandise for your personal or family use, you must exclude this cost from the total amount of merchandise you bought for sale. Do this by crediting the purchases or sales account with the cost of merchandise you withdraw for personal use. You must also charge the amount to your drawing account. 
A drawing account is a separate account you should keep to record the business income you withdraw to pay for personal and family expenses. As stated above, you also use it to record withdrawals of merchandise for personal or family use. This account is also known as a withdrawals account or personal account. 
#### Line 37—Cost of Labor
Labor costs are usually an element of cost of goods sold only in a manufacturing or mining business. Small merchandisers (wholesalers, retailers, etc.) usually do not have labor costs that can properly be charged to cost of goods sold. In a manufacturing business, labor costs properly allocable to the cost of goods sold include both the direct and indirect labor used in fabricating the raw material into a finished, saleable product.
**Direct labor.**
Direct labor costs are the wages you pay to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. They also include a part of the wages you pay to employees who work directly on the product part time if you can determine that part of their wages. 
**Indirect labor.**
Indirect labor costs are the wages you pay to employees who perform a general factory function that does not have any immediate or direct connection with making the saleable product, but that is a necessary part of the manufacturing process.
**Other labor.**
Other labor costs not properly chargeable to the cost of goods sold can be deducted as selling or administrative expenses. Generally, the only kinds of labor costs properly chargeable to your cost of goods sold are the direct or indirect labor costs and certain other costs treated as overhead expenses properly charged to the manufacturing process, as discussed later under _Line 39—Other Costs_.
#### Line 38—Materials and Supplies
Materials and supplies, such as hardware and chemicals, used in manufacturing goods are charged to cost of goods sold. Those that are not used in the manufacturing process are treated as deferred charges. You deduct them as a business expense when you use them. Business expenses are discussed in chapter 8.
#### Line 39—Other Costs
Examples of other costs incurred in a manufacturing or mining process that you charge to your cost of goods sold are as follows.
**Containers.**
Containers and packages that are an integral part of the product manufactured are a part of your cost of goods sold. If they are not an integral part of the manufactured product, their costs are shipping or selling expenses. 
**Freight-in.**
Freight-in, express-in, and cartage-in on raw materials, supplies you use in production, and merchandise you purchase for sale are all part of cost of goods sold. 
**Overhead expenses.**
Overhead expenses include expenses such as rent, heat, light, power, insurance, depreciation, taxes, maintenance, labor, and supervision. The overhead expenses you have as direct and necessary expenses of the manufacturing operation are included in your cost of goods sold. 
#### Line 40—Add Lines 35 Through 39
The total of lines 35 through 39 equals the cost of the goods available for sale during the year.
#### Line 41—Inventory at End of Year
Subtract the value of your closing inventory (including, as appropriate, the allocable parts of the cost of raw materials and supplies, direct labor, and overhead expenses) from line 40. Inventory at the end of the year is also known as closing or ending inventory. Your ending inventory will usually become the beginning inventory of your next tax year.
#### Line 42—Cost of Goods Sold
When you subtract your closing inventory (inventory at the end of the year) from the cost of goods available for sale, the remainder is your cost of goods sold during the tax year.

## 6. 如何计算商品销售成本
#### 介绍
如果您制造或购买商品以进行销售，您可以在 附表 C 中从您的总收入中扣除商品销售成本。但是，要确定这些成本，您必须在每个纳税年度开始和结束时评估您的库存。
如果您是制造商、批发商或零售商，或者如果您从事任何制造、购买或销售商品以产生收入的业务，则本章适用于您。本章不适用于个人服务业务，例如医生、律师、木匠或油漆工等业务。但是，如果您从事个人服务业务并且还销售您业务中通常使用的材料和用品或对其收费，则本章适用于您。
#### 在附表 C 第 35 - 42 行 计算商品销售成本
通过填写 附表 C 第 35-42 行来计算您的商品销售成本。这些行的内容见 下文并在 接下来的讨论中介绍。
**35** | 年初库存。如果与去年的期末库存不同，请附上说明 | _____  
---|---|---  
**36** | 用购买价格减去撤回供个人使用的商品的成本所得的金额 | _____  
**37** | 劳动力成本。不包括支付给您自己的任何款额 | _____  
**38** | 材料和用品 | _____  
**39** | 其他成本 |   
**40** | 将第 35-39 行所列金额相加 | _____  
**41** | 年末库存 |   
**42** | **商品销售成本。** 用第 40 行所列金额减去第 41 行所列金额。 将结果输入此处和第 4 行 |   
#### 第 35 行——年初库存
如果您是商人，期初库存是指您将出售给客户的年初现有商品的成本。如果您是制造商或生产商，则它包括原材料、在制品、制成品以及制造商品所用材料和用品的总成本（请参阅第 2 章中的 _库存_ ）。
期初库存通常与上一年的期末库存相同。您须在报税表随附的附表中说明任何差异。
**捐赠库存。**
如果您捐赠库存（您在业务过程中出售的财产），您可以申报为捐赠扣除额的金额是其在您捐赠之日的公平市场价值或其基数（以较小者为准）。捐赠库存的基数是上一年库存产生的、您将计入捐赠当年的期初库存中的任何成本。您须从期初库存中移除捐赠扣除额，它不构成商品销售成本的一部分。
如未将捐赠库存成本计入期初库存中，则库存基数为零，您不能申报慈善捐赠扣除额。按照您通常采用的会计方法处理库存成本。例如，将当年购买和捐赠的库存的购买价格计入当年的商品销售成本中。
特殊规定可能适用于特定食品捐赠库存。请参阅第 526 号刊物《慈善捐赠》。
**示例 1。**
您是使用应计会计处理方法的日历年度纳税人。2024 年，您将库存财产捐赠给了教会。它的公平市场价值为 600 美元。2023 年底的期末库存中正确计入了因收购该财产而产生的 400 美元成本，并且 2023 年，您适当地扣除了由该财产产生的 50 美元行政及其他支出作为营业支出。2024 年允许的慈善捐赠额为 400 美元（600 美元 - 200 美元）。如果您在赠送之日以公平市场价值出售了捐赠库存，那么 200 美元就是普通收入的金额。您用于确定 2024 年总收入的商品销售成本不得包括 400 美元。您从 2024 年的期初库存中移除该金额。
**示例 2。**
在 _示例 1_ 中，如果您 2024 年以 400 美元的成本获得了捐赠财产，您在计算 2024 年的商品销售成本时应计入该财产的 400 美元成本，并扣除当年由该财产产生的 50 美元行政及其他支出。您不得对捐赠财产进行任何慈善捐赠扣除。
#### 第 36 行 —— 用购买价格减去撤回供个人使用的商品的成本所得的金额
如果您是商人，请使用您为销售而购买的所有商品的成本。如果您是制造商或生产商，则应包括为制造成制成品而购买的所有原材料或零件的成本。
**交易折扣。**
商品标明价格与实际支付价格之间的差额称为交易折扣。计算购买成本时，您必须使用支付价格（而不是标明价格）。不要将折扣金额单独列为总收入中的一个项目。
汽车经销商必须记录减去任何制造商回扣（代表交易折扣）后所得的汽车库存成本。
**现金折扣。**
现金折扣是指供应商允许您从购买发票中扣除以便及时付款的金额。处理现金折扣有两种会计方法。您可以将其记入单独的折扣账户，也可以从当年的总购买价格中扣除。无论使用哪种方法，都必须保持一致。如果要变更计算库存成本的方法，您必须提交 3115 表。有关更多信息，请参阅第 2 章中的 _会计方法变更_ 。
如果您将现金折扣记入一个单独的账户，您必须将此贷记余额计入您在纳税年度结束时的营业收入中。如果您使用此方法，请不要通过现金折扣降低您的商品销售成本。
**购买退款和津贴。**
您必须从当年的总购买价格中扣除所有退款和津贴。
**将商品撤回销售。**
如果您撤回商品供个人或家庭使用，您必须从您购买用于销售的商品的总额中扣除此成本。为此，您可以将撤回供个人使用的商品的成本记入购买或销售账户中。您还须将此金额记入您的提款账户。 
提款账户是一个单独的账户，您应该保留以记录您为支付个人和家庭支出而提取的营业收入。如上所述，您还可以使用它来记录供个人或家庭使用的商品的撤回情况。此账户也称为撤回账户或个人账户。
#### 第 37 行 —— 劳动力成本
劳动力成本通常只是制造或采矿业务中商品销售成本的一个要素。小型商家（批发商、零售商等）通常不会产生可以适当计入商品销售成本中的劳动力成本。在制造业务中，可适当分配到商品销售成本中的劳动力成本包括将原材料制造成可销售制成品所使用的直接和间接劳动力成本。
**直接劳动力。**
直接劳动力成本是指您支付给那些将所有时间直接用于制造产品的雇员的工资。其中还包括您支付给直接从事产品工作的兼职雇员的那部分工资，前提是您可以确定其对应部分的工资。
**间接劳动力。**
间接劳动力成本是指您支付给履行一般工厂职能的雇员的工资，这些职能与制造可销售产品没有任何直接联系，但构成制造过程的必要部分。
**其他劳动力。**
不能适当地计入商品销售成本中的其他劳动力成本可以作为销售或管理支出扣除。一般而言，唯一可以适当地计入商品销售成本中的劳动力成本是直接或间接劳动力成本以及被视为管理支出适当地计入制造过程的某些其他成本（如下文 _第 39 行 —— 其他成本_ 所述）。
#### 第 38 行 —— 材料和用品
制造商品所用的材料和用品（例如，硬件和化学品）计入商品销售成本中。未在制造过程中使用的费用作为递延费用处理。您在使用这些费用时将其作为营业支出扣除。营业支出在 第 8 章讨论。
#### 第 39 行 —— 其他成本
您计入商品销售成本中的在制造或采矿过程中产生的其他成本示例如下。
**容器。**
作为所制造产品的一个组成部分的容器和包装构成商品销售成本的一部分。如果不是所制造产品的一个组成部分，则其成本为运费或销售支出。
**进货运费。**
原材料、您在生产中使用的用品以及您为销售而购买的商品的进货运费、进货快递费和进货搬运费都构成商品销售成本的一部分。
**管理支出。**
管理支出包括租金、暖气费、照明费、电费、保险费、折旧费、税费、维护费、劳动力成本和监督费等支出。您产生的作为制造业务的直接必要支出的管理支出计入您的商品销售成本中。
#### 第 40 行 —— 将第 35-39 行所列金额相加
第 35-39 行所列金额的总和相当于当年可销售商品的成本。
#### 第 41 行 —— 年末库存
用第 40 行所列金额减去期末库存价值（酌情包括原材料和用品成本、直接劳动力成本和管理支出的可分配部分） 。年末库存也称为期末库存。期末库存通常为下一个纳税年度的期初库存。
#### 第 42 行 —— 商品销售成本
用可销售商品的成本减去期末库存（年末库存）所得的余额就是您在纳税年度的商品销售成本。
