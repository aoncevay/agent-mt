## 5. Disallowance of the EIC
This chapter is for people whose EIC for any year after 1996 was denied or reduced by the IRS. If this applies to you, you may need to complete Form 8862, Information To Claim Certain Credits After Disallowance, and attach it to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. This chapter explains when you need to attach Form 8862. For more information, see Form 8862 and its instructions.
This chapter also explains the rules for certain people who can’t claim the EIC for a period of years after their EIC was denied or reduced.
#### Form 8862
If your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error, you must attach a completed Form 8862 to your next tax return to claim the EIC. You must also qualify to claim the EIC by meeting all the rules described in this publication.
**Exception 1.**
Don't file Form 8862 if either (1) or (2) below is true.
  1. After your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year:
    1. You filed Form 8862 in a later year and your EIC for that later year was allowed, and
    2. Your EIC hasn't been reduced or disallowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.
  2. You are claiming the EIC without a qualifying child for 2024 and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year was because the IRS determined that a child listed on Schedule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.
In either of these cases, you can take the EIC without filing Form 8862 if you meet all the EIC eligibility requirements.
**Exception 2.**
Don't file Form 8862 or take the EIC for:
  * 2 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or 
  * 10 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud. 
**More information.**
For details, see _Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?_ in this chapter.
The date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect whether you need to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return or to a later return. The following examples demonstrate whether Form 8862 is required for 2024 or 2025.
**Example 1—Form 8862 required for 2024.**
You filed your 2023 tax return in March 2024 and claimed the EIC with a qualifying child. The IRS questioned the EIC, and you were unable to prove the child was a qualifying child. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you that an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. To claim the EIC with a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to that return. However, to claim the EIC without a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you don't need to file Form 8862.
**Example 2—Form 8862 required for 2025.**
The facts are the same as in the previous example except that you received the statutory notice of deficiency in February 2025. Because the 90-day period referred to in the statutory notice isn't over when you are ready to file your return for 2024, you shouldn't attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return. However, to claim the EIC with a qualifying child for 2025, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year. To claim the EIC without a qualifying child for 2025, you don't need to file Form 8862.
**Exception for math or clerical errors.**
If your EIC was denied or reduced as a result of a math or clerical error, don't attach Form 8862 to your next tax return. For example, if your arithmetic is incorrect, the IRS can correct it. If you don't provide a correct SSN, the IRS can deny the EIC. These types of errors are called math or clerical errors. 
**Omission of Form 8862.**
If you are required to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 tax return, and you claim the EIC without attaching a completed Form 8862, your claim will be automatically denied. This is considered a math or clerical error. You won't be permitted to claim the EIC without a completed Form 8862.
**Additional documents may be required.**
You may have to provide the IRS with additional documents or information before a refund relating to the EIC you claim is released to you, even if you attach a properly completed Form 8862 to your return.
#### Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?
If your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied and it was determined that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 2 years. If your error was due to fraud, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 10 years. The date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect the years for which you are prohibited from claiming the EIC. The following examples demonstrate which years you are prohibited from claiming the EIC.
**Example 3—Cannot claim EIC for 2 years.**
You claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in March 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2024 or 2025. To claim the EIC on your return for 2026, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.
**Example 4.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 3_ , except that your 2023 EIC wasn’t denied until after you filed your 2024 return. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2025 or 2026. To claim the EIC on your return for 2027, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.
**Example 5—Cannot claim EIC for 10 years.**
You claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in February 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to fraud. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax years 2024 through 2033. To claim the EIC on your return for 2034, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.
If you disagree with the final determination of the IRS that you are prohibited from claiming the EIC for a period of years and want to appeal this determination, see the Instructions for Form 8862, _How to appeal the disallowance period_.

## 5. 禁用 EIC
本章适用于 IRS 自 1996 年起驳回或减少其任一年的 EIC 金额的人士。如果此规定适用于您，您 2024 年可能需要填写表格 8862《被禁用后申请特定抵免所需的信息》并将其附在您的 2024 年报税表中才能申请抵免。本章介绍了何时需要附上表格 8862。有关更多信息，请参阅表格 8862 及其说明。
本章还介绍了适用于在其 EIC 金额被驳回或减少后几年内不能申报 EIC 的特定人士的规则。
#### 表格 8862
如果自 1996 年起您任一年的 EIC 金额因数学错误或笔误以外的任何原因被驳回或减少，您必须将填好的表格 8862 附在您的下一份报税表中才能申报 EIC。您还必须符合本刊物中所述的所有规则，才有资格申报 EIC。
**例外情况 1。**
如果以下 (1) 或 (2) 属实，请勿提交表格 8862。
  1. 您的 EIC 金额在上一年被减少或禁用后：
    1. 您在下一年提交了表格 8862，并且您下一年的 EIC 金额被禁用了；以及
    2. 您的 EIC 金额未因数学错误或笔误以外的任何原因再次被减少或禁用。
  2. 您 2024 年可申报无合格条件子女时可申报的 EIC，并且您的 EIC 金额在上一年被减少或禁用的唯一原因是 IRS 认定附表 EIC 中列出的子女不是您的合条件子女。
在上述任一情况下，如果您符合所有 EIC 资格要求，您无需提交表格 8862 即可享受 EIC。
**例外情况 2。**
在以下时间内，请勿提交表格 8862 或享受 EIC：
  * 在最终确定您是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则而提出 EIC 申请后 2 年内；或者 
  * 在最终确定您是由于实施欺诈行为而提出 EIC 申请后 10 年内。 
**更多信息。**
有关详细信息，请参阅本章中的 _您是否数年内不得申报 EIC？_ 。
您的 EIC 金额被驳回的日期以及您提交 2024 年报税表的日期会影响您需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表还是之后的报税表中。以下示例说明了需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表还是 2025 年报税表中。
**示例 1——需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表中。**
您于 2024 年 3 月提交了 2023 年报税表，并申请了有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。IRS 质疑您的 EIC 金额，而您无法证明所述子女是合条件子女。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在 2024 年报税表中，才能在该报税表中申请有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。但是，您无需提交表格 8862，即可在 2024 年报税表中申请无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。
**示例 2——需要将表格 8862 附在 2025 年报税表中。**
事实与上一示例所述事实相同，不同的是您于 2025 年 2 月收到了法定欠款通知。由于法定通知中提到的 90 天期限在您准备提交 2024 年报税表时尚未结束，因此您不应在 2024 年报税表中附上表格 8862。但是，您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您的 2025 年报税表中，才能申请有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。您无需提交表格 8862，即可申报 2025 年无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。
**数学错误或笔误的例外情况。**
如果您的 EIC 金额因数学错误或笔误而被驳回或减少，请勿将表格 8862 附在您的下一份报税表中。例如，如果您的算术不正确，IRS 可予纠正。如果您未提供正确的社会安全号码，IRS 可以驳回 EIC 金额。上述类型的错误被称为数学错误或笔误。 
**遗漏表格 8862。**
如果您必须在 2024 年报税表中附上表格 8862，但您在申报 EIC 时未附上填好的表格 8862，则您的申请将被自动驳回。这被视为数学错误或笔误。如未附上填好的表格 8862，则不得申报 EIC。
**可能还需要其他文件。**
即使您已将正确填好的表格 8862 附在了您的报税表中，您可能还必须向 IRS 提供其他文件或信息，IRS 才会向您发放与您申请的 EIC 相关的退款。
#### 您是否数年内不得申报 EIC？
如果自 1996 年起您任一年的 EIC 金额被驳回，并且确定您的错误是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则造成的，则您在接下来 2 年内不能申报 EIC。如果您的错误是由于实施欺诈行为造成的，则您在接下来 10 年内不能申报 EIC。您的 EIC 金额被驳回的日期以及您提交 2024 年报税表的日期会影响您不得申报 EIC 的年数。以下示例说明了您不得申报 EIC 的年数。
**示例 3——2 年内不能申报 EIC。**
您在 2024 年 3 月提交的 2023 年报税表中申请了 EIC。IRS 认定您无权享受 EIC，并且您的错误是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您在 2024 或 2025 纳税年度不能申报 EIC。要在 2026 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。
**示例 4。**
事实与 _示例 3_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的 2023 年 EIC 金额在您提交 2024 年报税表后才被驳回。您在 2025 或 2026 纳税年度不能申报 EIC。要在 2027 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。
**示例 5——10 年内不能申报 EIC。**
您在 2024 年 2 月提交的 2023 年报税表中申请了 EIC。IRS 认定您无权享受 EIC，并且您的错误是由于实施欺诈行为造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您在 2024 至 2033 纳税年度不能申报EIC。要在 2034 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。
如果您不同意 IRS 的最终决定，即您在一段时间内被禁止申报 EIC，并且想要对此决定提出上诉，请参阅 8862 表格的说明， _如何对禁止期提出上诉_ 。
