#### Rule 9—Your Qualifying Child Cannot Be Used by More Than One Person To Claim the EIC
Sometimes a child meets the tests to be a qualifying child of more than one person. However, only one of these persons can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. Only that person can use the child as a qualifying child to take all of the following tax benefits (provided the person is eligible for each benefit).
  1. The child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit.
  2. Head of household filing status. 
  3. The credit for child and dependent care expenses.
  4. The exclusion for dependent care benefits.
  5. The EIC.
The other person can’t take any of these benefits based on this qualifying child. In other words, you and the other person can’t agree to divide these tax benefits between you. The other person can’t take any of these tax benefits unless that person has a different qualifying child. 
The tiebreaker rules, which follow, explain who, if anyone, can claim the EIC when more than one person has the same qualifying child. However, the tiebreaker rules don't apply if the other person is your spouse and you file a joint return.
**Tiebreaker rules.**
To determine which person can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the five tax benefits just listed, the following tiebreaker rules apply. For purposes of these tiebreaker rules, the term “parent” means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It does not include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.
  * If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.
  * If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.
  * If the parents don't file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher AGI for the year.
  * If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year.
  * If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent claims the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of the child's parents who can claim the child.
Subject to these tiebreaker rules, you and the other person may be able to choose which of you claims the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 1 through 12.
If you can’t claim the EIC because your qualifying child is treated under the tiebreaker rules as the qualifying child of another person for 2024, you may be able to take the EIC using a different qualifying child, or take the EIC using the rules in chapter 3 for people who don't have a qualifying child.
**If the other person cannot claim the EIC.**
If you and someone else have the same qualifying child but the other person can’t claim the EIC because the other person isn't eligible or their earned income or AGI is too high, you may be able to treat the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 6 and 7. But you can’t treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the EIC if the other person uses the child to claim any of the other five tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter.
**Examples.**
The following examples may help you in determining whether you can claim the EIC when you and someone else have the same qualifying child.
**Example 1—Child lived with parent and grandparent.**
You and your 2-year-old child Sam lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. Your only income was $9,000 from a part-time job. Your parent's only income was $22,000 from a job, and their AGI is $22,000. Your child’s other parent did not live with you or Sam. The special rule explained later for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply. Sam is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Sam meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only one of you can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and the other tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter for which that person qualifies). Sam isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, including the child’s other parent. If you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which your parent qualifies).
**Example 2—Parent has higher AGI than grandparent.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your AGI is $25,000. Because your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your parent can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only you can claim Sam.
**Example 3—Two persons claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you and your parent both claim Sam as a qualifying child. In this case, you as the child's parent will be the only one allowed to claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC and the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier based on Sam. Your parent can't take the EIC for a taxpayer without a qualifying child because your parent’s AGI is more than $18,591.
**Example 4—Qualifying children split between two persons.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you also have two other young children who are qualifying children of both you and your parent. Only one of you can claim each child. However, if your parent's AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your parent to claim one or more of the children. For example, if you claim one child, your parent can claim the other two.
**Example 5—Taxpayer who is a qualifying child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you are only 18 years old. This means you are a qualifying child of your parent. Because of _Rule 10_ , discussed next, you can’t claim the EIC and can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only your parent may be able to treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC. If your parent meets all the other requirements for claiming the EIC and you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can claim both you and Sam as qualifying children for the EIC.
**Example 6—Grandparent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that your parent earned $50,000 from employment. Because your parent's earned income is too high for your parent to claim the EIC, only you can claim the EIC using Sam.
**Example 7—Parent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you earned $50,000 from your job and your AGI is $50,500. Your earned income is too high for you to claim the EIC. But your parent can’t claim the EIC either, because your parent’s AGI isn't higher than yours.
**Example 8—Separated parents.**
You, your spouse, and your 10-year-old child, Jordan, lived together until August 1, 2024, when your spouse moved out of the household. In August and September, Jordan lived with you. For the rest of the year, Jordan lived with Jordan's other parent. Jordan is a qualifying child of both you and your spouse because Jordan lived with each of you for more than half the year and because Jordan met the relationship, age, and joint return tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written separation agreement, so the _Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_.") doesn't apply. 
You and your spouse will file separate returns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This means, if your spouse doesn't claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any of the tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any tax benefit listed earlier for which you qualify. However, you can't take the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and, while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet the requirements for certain separated spouses to take the EIC when they don’t file a joint return. See Rule 3. You also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.
**Example 9—Separated parents claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 8_ , except that you and your spouse both claim Jordan as a qualifying child. In this case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This is because, during 2024, Jordan lived with your spouse longer than with you. You can’t claim the EIC because you are a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return and you don’t have a qualifying child. However, your spouse's filing status is also married filing separately, so your spouse can’t claim the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 or you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn't meet the requirements to claim the EIC as a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return. See Rule 3. Your spouse also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your spouse’s filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.
**Example 10—Unmarried parents.**
You, your 5-year-old child, Logan, and Logan’s other parent lived together all year. You and Logan’s other parent aren't married. Logan is a qualifying child of both you and Logan’s other parent because Logan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and Logan’s other parent. Your earned income and AGI are $12,000, and Logan’s other parent’s earned income and AGI are $14,000. Neither of you had any other income. Logan’s other parent agrees to let you treat the child as a qualifying child. This means if Logan’s other parent doesn't claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify.
**Example 11—Unmarried parents claim same child.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 10_ except that you and Logan’s other parent both claim Logan as a qualifying child. In this case, only Logan’s other parent will be allowed to treat Logan as a qualifying child. This is because Logan’s other parent’s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, $12,000. You can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.
**Example 12—Child did not live with a parent.**
You and your sibling’s child, Morgan, lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your only income was from a part-time job. Your parent’s AGI is $15,000. Your parent’s only income was from a job. Morgan’s parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and don't live with you or Morgan. Morgan is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Morgan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only your parent can treat Morgan as a qualifying child. This is because your parent’s AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.
**Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).**
A child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all of the following statements are true.
  1. The parents:
    1. Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;
    2. Are separated under a written separation agreement; or
    3. Lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024.
  2. The child received over half of the child’s support for the year from the parents.
  3. The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of 2024.
  4. Either of the following statements is true.
    1. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that the custodial parent will not claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches the form or statement to their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. 
    2. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024.
For details, see Pub. 501. If a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under this special rule for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), only the noncustodial parent can claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents for the child. However, only the custodial parent, if eligible, or another eligible taxpayer can claim the child as a qualifying child for the EIC. For details and examples, see _Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_ in Pub. 501.

#### 第 9 条规则——您的合条件子女不能供多人用于申报 EIC
有时，一个子女通过了成为多人的合条件子女的测试。但是，这些人中实际上只有一人可以将该子女视为合条件子女。只有该人可以凭借该子女的合条件子女身份来享受以下所有税收福利（前提是该人有资格享受每项福利）。
  1. 子女税抵免优惠、其他被抚养人的抵免优惠额以及附加子女税收抵免优惠。
  2. 户主报税身份。
  3. 子女和被抚养人护理费用抵免。
  4. 被抚养人护理福利的除外情况。
  5. EIC。
其他人不能凭借该合条件子女享受以上任何福利。换言之，您和其他人不能约定在您们之间分配以上税收福利。除非拥有其他合条件子女，否则其他人不能享受以上任何税收福利。 
下面的决胜局规则解释了当多人拥有同一合条件子女时，哪个人（如果有）可以申报 EIC。但是，如果其他人是您的配偶并且您们提交了联合报税表，则决胜局规则不适用。
**决胜局规则。**
确定哪个人可以凭借该子女的合条件子女身份来申请以上列出的五项税收福利时，适用以下决胜局规则。出于这些决胜局规则的目的，“parent” (父母) 一词是指个人的亲生父母或收养父母。这不包括继父母或养父母，除非该人收养了该子女。
  * 如果其中只有一人是该子女的父母，则视该子女为其父母的合条件子女。
  * 如果父母双方共同提交联合报税表并且可以将该子女申报为合条件子女，则视该子女为其父母双方的合条件子女。
  * 如果父母双方未共同提交联合报税表但同时将该子女申报为合条件子女，IRS 会将该子女视为相关年度与该子女同住时间更长的父母一方的合条件子女。如果该子女与父母双方同住的时间相同，IRS 会将该子女视为相关年度调整后总收入 (AGI) 更高的父母一方的合条件子女。
  * 如果父母双方均不能将该子女申报为合条件子女，则将该子女视为相关年度 AGI 最高之人的合条件子女。
  * 如果父母一方可以将该子女申报为合条件子女但没有这样做，则将该子女视为相关年度 AGI 最高之人的合条件子女，但前提是该人的 AGI 高于可以将该子女申报为合条件子女的任何父母的最高 AGI。
根据这些决胜局规则，您和其他人可以选择让谁将该子女申报为合条件子女。请参阅示例 1至示例 12。
如果您因 2024 年您的合条件子女根据决胜局规则被视为其他人的合条件子女而不能申报 EIC，则您可以凭借其他合条件子女或者根据第 3 章中适用于无任何合条件子女之人的规则享受 EIC。
**如果其他人不能申报 EIC。**
如果您和其他人拥有同一合条件子女，但其他人因不符合条件或者其劳动所得或 AGI 太高而不能申报 EIC，则您可以将该子女视为合条件子女。请参阅示例 6 和示例 7。但是，如果其他人凭借该子女来申请本章上文列出的任何其他五项税收福利，则您不能凭借该子女的合条件子女身份来申报 EIC。
**示例。**
以下示例可以帮助您确定当您和其他人拥有同一合条件子女时，您能否申报 EIC。
**示例 1——子女与父母和祖父母同住。**
您和您 2 岁的子女 Sam 全年都与您母亲同住。您 25 岁，未婚，您的 AGI 为 9,000 美元。您的唯一收入是兼职工作获得的 9,000 美元。您父母的唯一收入是工作获得的 22,000 美元，而其 AGI 是 22,000 美元。您子女的另一方父母未与您和 Sam 同住。下文介绍的适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定不适用。Sam 是您和您父母的合条件子女，因为 Sam 通过了针对您和您父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。但是，您和您父母只有一人可以凭借其合条件子女身份来申报 EIC（以及本章上文列出的该人有资格享受的其他税收福利）。Sam 不属于任何其他人的合条件子女，包括其另一方父母。如果您未为了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以凭借其合条件子女身份来申报 EIC（以及上文列出的您父母有资格享受的任何其他税收福利）。
**示例 2——父母的 AGI 比祖父母高。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的 AGI 是 25,000 美元。因为您父母的 AGI 并不比您高，所以您父母不能将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。只有您可以将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。
**示例 3——两人同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和您父母同时将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，您作为 Sam 的父母将是唯一被允许为了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有资格享受的其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女的人。IRS 将不允许您父母凭借 Sam 来申报 EIC 以及上文列出的任何其他税收福利。您父母不能享受无任何合条件子女的纳税人可享受的 EIC，因为您父母的 AGI 超过了 18,591 美元。
**示例 4——两人共同分配合条件子女。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您还有另外两个年幼的子女，他们都是您和您父母的合条件子女。每个子女仅供您和您父母中的一人申报为合条件子女。但是，如果您父母的 AGI 比您高，您可以让您父母将一个或多个子女申报为合条件子女。例如，如果您将一个子女申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以将另外两个子女申报为合条件子女。
**示例 5——合条件子女为纳税人。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您只有 18 岁。这意味着您是您父母的合条件子女。根据接下来要讨论的 _第 10 条规则_ ，您不能申报 EIC，也不能将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。只有您父母可以凭借 Sam 的合条件子女身份来申报 EIC。如果您父母符合申报 EIC 的所有其他要求，而您未为了享受上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以为了享受 EIC 而将您和 Sam 同时申报为合条件子女。
**示例 6——祖父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您父母的工作收入是 50,000 美元。您父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC，因此只有您可以凭借 Sam 申报 EIC。
**示例 7——父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的工作收入是 50,000 美元，您的 AGI 是 50,500 美元。您因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。但是您父母也不能申报 EIC，因为您父母的 AGI 并不比您高。
**示例 8——父母分居。**
您、您配偶和您 10 岁的子女 Jordan 一直同住，直到 2024 年 8 月 1 日您配偶搬出去。8 月和 9 月，Jordan 和您同住。在这一年剩下的时间里，Jordan 和您配偶（Jordan 的另一方父母）同住。Jordan 同时是您和您配偶的合条件子女，因为 Jordan 和您们两人都同住了半年以上的时间，而且 Jordan 通过了针对您们俩的关系、年龄和联合报税表测试。到年底时，您和您配偶仍未离异、合法分居或根据书面分居协议进行分居，所以 _适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定_ 不适用。 
您和您配偶将分别提交单独报税表。您配偶同意让您将 Jordan 视为合条件子女。这意味着，如果您配偶未为了享受上文列出的任何税收福利而将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女，则您可以为了享受上文列出的您有资格享受的任何税收福利而将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女。但是，您不能获取 EIC，因为您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分居，而且，虽然您们在 2024 年底确实分居，但您们并没有根据书面分居协议或单独抚养令合法分居。因此，您不符合某些分居配偶在不提交联合申报表的情况下享受 EIC 的要求。请参阅第 3 条规则。您也不能享受子女和被抚养人护理费用抵免，因为您的申报身份是已婚分别申报，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住。请参阅 503 号刊物。
**示例 9——分居父母双方同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**
事实与 _示例 8_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和您配偶同时将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，只有您配偶可以将 Jordan 视为合条件子女。这是因为，Jordan 2024 年与您配偶同住的时间比与您同住的时间长。您不能申报 EIC，因为您是没有联合报税的分居配偶，而且您没有一个符合条件的孩子。但是，您配偶的申报身份也是已婚分别申报，所以您配偶不能申报 EIC，因为您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住，或者您们没有根据书面分居协议或分开抚养的法令合法分居。因此，您配偶作为没有提交联合报税表的分居配偶，不符合申报 EIC 的要求。请参阅第 3 条规则。您配偶也不能享受子女和被抚养人护理费用抵免，因为您配偶的申报身份是已婚分别申报，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住。请参阅 503 号刊物。
**示例 10——父母未婚。**
您、您 5 岁的子女 Logan 以及您子女的另一方父母全年同住。您和 Logan 的另一方父母未婚。Logan 是您和 Logan 的另一方父母的合条件子女，因为 Logan 通过了针对您和 Logan 另一方父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。您的劳动所得和 AGI 均为 12,000 美元，Logan 的另一方父母的劳动所得和 AGI 均为 14,000 美元。您们都没有任何其他收入。Logan 的另一方父母同意让您将 Logan 视为合条件子女。这意味着，如果 Logan 的另一方父母没有为了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Logan 申报为合条件子女，则您可以为了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有资格享受的任何其他税收福利而将 Logan 申报为合条件子女。
**示例 11——未婚父母双方同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**
事实与 _示例 10_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和 Logan 的另一方父母同时将 Logan 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，只有 Logan 的另一方父母可以将 Logan 视为合条件子女。这是因为其 AGI（14,000 美元）比您的 AGI（12,000 美元）高。您可以申请无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。
**示例 12——子女未与父母同住。**
您和您兄弟姐妹的子女 Morgan 全年都与您父母同住。您今年 25 岁，您的 AGI 为 9,300 美元。您通过兼职工作获得唯一收入。您父母的 AGI 是 15,000 美元。您父母通过工作获得唯一收入。Morgan 的父母联合报税，他们的 AGI 低于 9,000 美元，并且他们不与您和 Morgan 同住。Morgan 同时是您和您父母的合条件子女，因为 Morgan 通过了针对您和您父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。但是，只有您父母可以将 Morgan 视为合条件子女。这是因为您父母的 AGI（15,000 美元）比您的 AGI（9,300 美元）高。
**适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定。**
如果以下所有陈述均属实，则相关子女将被视为其非监护父母的合条件子女。
  1. 父母：
    1. 根据离婚或单独赡养法令进行离婚或合法分居；
    2. 根据书面分居协议进行分居；或者
    3. 在 2024 年的最后 6 个月内一直分居。
  2. 子女在这一年里从父母那里获得了一半以上的抚养费。
  3. 子女 2024 年有一半以上的时间由父母一方或双方监护。
  4. 以下任一陈述均属实。
    1. 监护父母签署表格 8332 或基本类似的声明，表明其在相关年度不会将子女申报为被抚养人，而非监护父母将该表格或声明附在其报税表中。如果离婚法令或分居协议在 1984 年至 2009 年期间生效，则非监护父母可以附上该法令或协议（而不是表格 8332）中的某些页面。
    2. 适用于 2024 年的 1985 年之前的离婚或单独赡养法令或书面分居协议规定，非监护父母可以将子女申报为被抚养人，并且非监护父母在 2024 年期间至少提供 600 美元子女抚养费。
有关详细信息，请参阅第501 号刊物。如果子女根据此适用于离异或分居父母子女的特殊规定被视为非监护父母的合条件子女，则只有非监护父母可以为子女申请子女税收抵免或其他被抚养人抵免。但是，只有监护父母（如果符合条件）或其他合条件纳税人可以为了享受 EIC 而将子女申报为合条件子女。有关详细信息和示例，请 _参阅_ 第 501 号刊物中的如何将决胜局规则应用于离异或分居父母。
