## 3. Rules if You Do Not Have a Qualifying Child
Use this chapter if you don't have a qualifying child and have met all the rules in chapter 1. This chapter discusses _Rules 11_ through _14_. You must meet all four of these rules, in addition to the rules in chapters 1 and 4, to qualify for the EIC without a qualifying child. If you meet all the rules in chapter 1 and this chapter, read chapter 4 to find out what to do next.
**If you have a qualifying child.**
If you meet _Rule 8_ , you have a qualifying child. If you meet _Rule 8_ and don't claim the EIC with a qualifying child, you can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.
#### Rule 11—You Must Meet the Age Requirements
You must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. If you are married filing a joint return, either you or your spouse must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. It doesn't matter which spouse meets the age test, as long as one of the spouses does.
You meet the age test if you were born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000. If you are married filing a joint return, you meet the age test if either you or your spouse was born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000.
If neither you nor your spouse meets the age test, you can't claim the EIC. Enter "No" on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**Example 1.**
You are age 28 and unmarried. You meet the age test.
**Example 2—Spouse meets age test.**
You are married and filing a joint return. You are age 23 and your spouse is age 27. You meet the age test because your spouse is at least age 25 but under age 65.
**Death of spouse.**
If you are filing a joint return with your spouse who died in 2024, you meet the age test if you are at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024, or your spouse was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.
Your spouse is considered to reach age 25 on the day before their 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; your spouse reaches age 65 on their 65th birthday.
Even if your spouse was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.
_**Example 1.**_
You are married and filing a joint return with your spouse who died in August 2024. You are age 67. Your spouse would have become age 65 in November 2024. Because your spouse was under age 65 at the time of death, you meet the age test.
**Example 2.**
Your spouse was born on February 14, 1999, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 25 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 25 at the time of death and isn't at least age 25 at the end of 2024.
**Death of taxpayer.**
A taxpayer who died in 2024 meets the age test if the taxpayer was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.
A taxpayer is considered to reach age 25 on the day before the taxpayer’s 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; a taxpayer reaches age 65 on the taxpayer’s 65th birthday.
Even if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.
#### Rule 12—You Cannot Be the Dependent of Another Person
If you **aren't** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check the box under your name that says "Someone can claim you as a dependent."
If you **are** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check either box that says "Someone can claim you as a dependent" or "Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent."
If you aren't sure whether someone else can claim you as a dependent, get Pub. 501 and read the rules for claiming a dependent.
If someone else can claim you as a dependent on their return, but doesn't, you still can’t claim the credit unless the person who can claim you on their tax return isn't required to file an income tax return and doesn't file a tax return or files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
**Example 1.**
In 2024, you were age 25, single, and living at home with your parents. You worked and weren't a student. You earned $7,500. Your parents can’t claim you as a dependent. When you file your return, you do not check the "Someone can claim you as a dependent" checkbox. You meet this rule. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements.
**Example 2.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ , except that you earned $2,000. Your parents can claim you as a dependent but decide not to. You don't meet this rule. You can’t claim the credit because your parents could have claimed you as a dependent.
**Joint returns.**
You generally can’t be claimed as a dependent by another person if you are married and file a joint return.
However, another person may be able to claim you as a dependent if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be claimed as a dependent by another person if you claim the EIC on your joint return.
**Example 1—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**
You are 26 years old. You and your spouse live with your parents and had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. Neither you nor your spouse is required to file a tax return. You don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of your pay so you file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. Your parents aren't disqualified from claiming you as a dependent just because you filed a joint return.
**Example 2—Return filed to get EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except no taxes were taken out of your pay. Also, you and your spouse aren't required to file a tax return, but you file a joint return to claim an EIC of $63 and get a refund of that amount. Because claiming the EIC is your reason for filing the return, you aren't filing it only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. Your parents can’t claim you or your spouse as a dependent.
#### Rule 13—You Cannot Be a Qualifying Child of Another Taxpayer
You are a qualifying child of another taxpayer (your parent, guardian, foster parent, etc.) if all of the following statements are true.
  1. You are that person's son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them. Or, you are that person's brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them. 
  2. You were:
    1. Under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly);
    2. Under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly); or
    3. Permanently and totally disabled, regardless of age.
  3. You lived with that person in the United States for more than half of the year.
  4. You aren't filing a joint return for the year (or are filing a joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).
For more details about the tests to be a qualifying child, see Rule 8. 
If you are a qualifying child of another taxpayer, you can’t claim the EIC. This is true even if the person for whom you are a qualifying child doesn't claim the EIC or meet all of the rules to claim the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**Example.**
You lived with your parent all year. You are age 26, unmarried, and permanently and totally disabled. Your only income was from a community center where you went 3 days a week to answer telephones. You earned $5,000 for the year and provided more than half of your own support. Because you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests, you are a qualifying child of your parent for the EIC. Your parent can claim the EIC if your parent meets all the other requirements. Because you are a qualifying child of your parent, you can’t claim the EIC. This is so even if your parent can’t or doesn’t claim the EIC.
**Joint returns.**
You generally can’t be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you are married and file a joint return.
However, you may be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you claim the EIC on your joint return.
**Child of person not required to file a return.**
You aren't the qualifying child of another taxpayer (and so may qualify to claim the EIC) if the person for whom you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests isn't required to file an income tax return and either:
  * Doesn't file an income tax return, or
  * Files a return only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.
**Example 1—Return not required.**
You lived all year with your parent. You are 27 years old, unmarried, permanently and totally disabled, and earned $13,000. You have no other income, no children, and provided more than half of your own support. Your parent had no gross income, isn't required to file a 2024 tax return, and doesn't file a 2024 tax return. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.
**Example 2—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your parent had wages of $1,500 and had income tax withheld from wages. Your parent files a return only to get a refund of the income tax withheld and doesn't claim the EIC or any other tax credits or deductions. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.
**Example 3—Return filed to get EIC.**
The facts are the same as in _Example 2_ except your parent claimed the EIC on their return. Since your parent filed the return to get the EIC, your parent isn't filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld. As a result, you are your parent’s qualifying child. You can’t claim the EIC.
#### Rule 14—You Must Have Lived in the United States More Than Half of the Year
Your home (and your spouse's if filing a joint return) must have been in the United States for more than half the year. 
If it wasn't, enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).
**United States.**
This means the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It doesn't include Puerto Rico or U.S. territories such as Guam.
**Homeless shelter.**
Your home can be any location where you regularly live. You don't need a traditional home. If you lived in one or more homeless shelters in the United States for more than half the year, you meet this rule. 
**Military personnel stationed outside the United States.**
U.S. military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty (defined in chapter 2) are considered to live in the United States during that duty period for purposes of the EIC.

## 3. 适用于您无任何合条件子女时的规则
如果您无任何合条件子女并且符合第 1 章中的所有规则，请使用本章。本章讨论 _第 11_ - _14_ 条规则。除了第 1 章和第 4 章中的规则外，您还必须全部符合以下四条规则，才有资格享受无任何合条件子女时可享受的 EIC。如果您符合第 1 章和本章中的所有规则，请阅读第 4 章了解下一步要做什么。
**如果您有一个合条件子女。**
如果您符合 _第 8 条规则_ ，则表示您有一个合条件子女。如果您符合 _第 8 条规则_ 并且未申请有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC，则可以申请无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。
#### 第 11 条规则——您必须符合年龄要求
您必须在 2024 年底至少年满 25 岁但未满 65 岁。如果您是已婚并提交联合申报，您或您的配偶在 2024 年底必须至少年满 25 岁但未满 65 岁。只要配偶之一符合年龄测试即可，究竟谁符合并不重要。。
如果您在 1959 年 12 月 31 日之后和 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前的期间出生，您就符合年龄测试。如果您已婚并提交联合申报表，并且您或您的配偶中的任何一方在 1959 年 12 月 31 日之后和 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前的期间出生，您就符合年龄测试。
如果您和您的配偶都不符合年龄测试，则您不能申报 EIC。输入 “No” (否) 在第 27 行（表格 1040 或 1040-SR）旁边的虚线上。
**示例 1。**
您今年 28 岁，未婚。您符合年龄测试。
**示例 2——配偶符合年龄测试。**
您已婚并提交联合申报表。您年满 23 岁，您的配偶年满 27 岁。您符合年龄测试，因为您的配偶年满 25 岁但未满 65 岁。
**配偶死亡。**
如果您与 2024 年死亡的配偶一起联合报税，如果您在 2024 年底至少 25 岁但未满 65 岁，或您的配偶在去世时至少 25 岁但未满 65 岁，您就符合年龄测试。 
您的配偶在 25 岁生日的前一天被视为年满 25 岁。但是，达到 65 岁的规则不同；您的配偶在 65 岁生日时是年满 65 岁。
即使您的配偶出生于 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前，到 2024 年底他们也不会被视为至少 25 岁，除非他们在死亡的时候至少年满 25 岁。
_**示例 1。**_
您是已婚人士，与 2024 年 8 月去世的配偶联合报税。您的年龄是 67 岁。您的配偶会在 2024 年 11 月满 65 岁。因为您的配偶去世时未满 65 岁，所以您符合年龄测试的要求。 
**示例 2。**
您的配偶于 1999 年 2 月 14 日出生，并于 2024 年 2 月 13 日死亡。您的配偶在死亡时被认为是 25 岁。 但是，如果您的配偶在 2024 年 2 月 12 日死亡，您的配偶在死亡时不被视为是 25 岁，在 2024 年底也不是至少年满 25 岁。
**纳税人死亡。**
在 2024 年死亡的纳税人符合年龄测试，如果该纳税人在死亡时至少为 25 岁，但不满 65 岁。
纳税人在其 25 岁生日的前一天被视为年满 25 岁。但是，达到 65 岁的规则不同；纳税人在其 65 岁生日时达到 65 岁。
即使纳税人出生于 2000 年 1 月 2 日之前，他们在 2024 年底也不会被视为至少 25 岁，除非他们在死亡时至少 25 岁。
#### 第 12 条规则——您不能是其他人的被抚养人
如果您 **未** 提交联合报税表，则您符合此规则，前提是您 **不** 勾选您姓名下方注明“其他人可以将您申报为被抚养人”的复选框。
如果您 **已** 提交联合报税表，则您符合此规则，前提是您 **不** 勾选注明“其他人可以将您申报为被抚养人”或“其他人可以将您配偶申报为被抚养人”的复选框。
如果您不确定其他人是否可以将您申报为被抚养人，请获取第501 号刊物并阅读适用于申报被抚养人的规则。
如果其他人可以在其报税表中将您申报为被抚养人但未这样做，您仍然不能申请抵免, 除非可以在报税表上申报您的人不需要申报个人所得税，也不报税，或者报税只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付的估计税款。
**示例 1。**
2024 年，您 25 岁、单身并与父母同住。您已工作，但已不是学生。您的收入为 7,500 美元。您父母不能将您申报为被抚养人。提交报税表时，您未勾选“其他人可以将您申报为被抚养人”复选框。您符合此规则。如果您符合所有其他要求，则可以申报 EIC。
**示例 2。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的收入为 2,000 美元。您父母可以将您申报为被抚养人，但他们决定不这样做。您不符合此规则。您不能申请抵免，因为您父母本可以将您申报为被抚养人。
**联合报税表。**
如果您已婚并提交了联合报税表，您通常不能被其他人申报为被抚养人。
但是，如果您和您配偶提交联合报税表只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付估计税款，则其他人可以将您申报为被抚养人。但是，如果您在联合报税表中申请了 EIC，则您和您配偶都不能被其他人申报为被抚养人。
**示例 1——提交报税表是为了要求退还预扣税款。**
您 26 岁。您和您配偶与您父母同住，您们通过兼职工作获得 800 美元的工资，但没有其他收入。您和您配偶都不需要提交报税表。您们没有子女。税款是从您们的工资中扣除的，因此您们提交联合报税表只是为了要求退还预扣税款。您父母不会仅仅因为您提交了联合报税表而被取消将您申报为被抚养人的资格。
**示例 2——提交报税表是为了享受 EIC。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是未从您们的工资中扣除任何税款。此外，您和您配偶不需要提交报税表，但您们提交联合报税表是为了申报 63 美元的 EIC 金额并要求退还该款额。因为申报 EIC 是您们提交报税表的原因，所以您们提交报税表并不只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付估计税款。您父母不能将您或您配偶申报为被抚养人。
#### 第 13 条规则——您不能是其他纳税人的合条件子女
如果以下所有陈述均属实，则您属于其他纳税人（您的父母、监护人、寄养父母等）的合条件子女。
  1. 您是此人的儿子、女儿、继子女、寄养子女或其中任何一个的后代。或者，您是此人的兄弟、姐妹、同父异母的兄弟、同父异母的姐妹、继兄弟、继姐妹或其中任何一个的后代。 
  2. 您：
    1. 年底未满 19 岁且比此人（或此人的配偶，如果此人联合报税）小；
    2. 年底未满 24 岁、是一名学生且比此人（或此人的配偶，如果此人联合报税）小；或者
    3. 有永久性完全伤残，无论年龄大小。
  3. 您与此人在美国同住了半年以上的时间。
  4. 您未提交相关年度的联合报税表（或者提交联合报税表只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付估计税款）。
有关成为合条件子女的测试的更多详细信息，请参阅 第 8 条规则。 
如果您是其他纳税人的合条件子女，则不能申报 EIC。即使您是其合条件子女的人未申报 EIC 或不符合申报 EIC 的所有规则，情况也是如此。请在第 27 行（表格 1040 或 1040-SR）旁边的虚线上输入 “No” (否)。
**示例。**
您全年都与您父母同住。您 26 岁，未婚，并且有永久性完全伤残。您的唯一收入来自社区中心接电话的工作，您每周去那里工作 3 天。您的年收入为 5,000 美元，并自行提供了一半以上的抚养费。因为您通过了关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试，所以您是可供您父母申报 EIC 的合条件子女。如果您父母符合所有其他要求，则您父母可以申报 EIC。因为您是您父母的合条件子女，所以您不能申报 EIC。即使您父母不能申请或不申报 EIC，情况也是如此。
**联合报税表。**
如果您已婚并提交了联合报税表，您通常不能是其他纳税人的合条件子女。
但是，如果您和您配偶提交联合报税表只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付估计税款，则您可以是其他纳税人的合条件子女。但是，如果您在联合报税表中申请了 EIC，则您和您配偶都不能是其他纳税人的合条件子女。
**不需要提交报税表之人的子女。**
如果您通过了针对其的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试的人不需要提交所得税报税表并且符合下列情况，则您不属于其他纳税人的合条件子女（且因此有资格申报 EIC）：
  * 未提交所得税报税表；或者
  * 提交报税表只是为了要求退还预扣所得税或已付估计税款。
**示例 1——不需要提交报税表。**
您全年都与您父母同住。您 27 岁，未婚，有永久性完全伤残，收入为 13,000 美元。您没有其他收入，无子女，并且自行提供了一半以上的抚养费。您父母没有总收入，不需要提交 2024 年报税表，也未提交 2024 年报税表。因此，您不是您父母的合条件子女。如果您符合所有其他要求，则可以申报 EIC。
**示例 2——提交报税表是为了要求退还预扣税款。**
事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您父母的工资是 1,500 美元，并且被从工资中预扣了所得税。您父母提交报税表只是为了要求退还预扣所得税，并且未申报 EIC 或任何其他税收抵免或扣除。因此，您不是您父母的合条件子女。如果您符合所有其他要求，则可以申报 EIC。
**示例 3——提交报税表是为了享受 EIC。**
事实与 _示例 2_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您父母在其报税表中申请了 EIC。由于您父母提交报税表是为了享受 EIC，因此您父母提交报税表并不只是为了要求退还预扣所得税。因此，您是您父母的合条件子女。您不能申报 EIC。
#### 第 14 条规则——您必须在美国居住了半年以上
您（和您配偶，如果提交的是联合报税表）必须在美国的住所居住了半年以上。 
如果情况不是如此，请在第 27 行（表格 1040 或 1040-SR）旁边的虚线上输入 “No” (否) 。
**美国。**
即 50 个州和哥伦比亚特区，不包括波多黎各和美国领土（例如关岛）。
**无家可归者收容所。**
您的住所可以是您常住的任何地点。您不需要传统住所。如果您在美国的一个或多个无家可归者收容所居住了半年以上，则表示您符合此规则。 
**驻扎在美国境外的军人。**
出于 EIC 的目的，驻扎在美国境外并长期服役（定义见第 2 章）的美国军人被视为在该服役期间居住在美国。
