{"en": "## 6. How To Figure Cost of Goods Sold\n#### Introduction\nIf you make or buy goods to sell, you can deduct the cost of goods sold from your gross receipts on Schedule C. However, to determine these costs, you must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year.\nThis chapter applies to you if you are a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer or if you are engaged in any business that makes, buys, or sells goods to produce income. This chapter does not apply to a personal service business, such as the business of a doctor, lawyer, carpenter, or painter. However, if you work in a personal service business and also sell or charge for the materials and supplies normally used in your business, this chapter applies to you.\n#### Figuring Cost of Goods Sold on Schedule C, Lines 35 Through 42\nFigure your cost of goods sold by filling out lines 35 through 42 of Schedule C. These lines are reproduced below and are explained in the discussion that follows.\n**35** | Inventory at beginning of year. If different from last year's closing inventory, attach explanation | _____  \n---|---|---  \n**36** | Purchases less cost of items withdrawn for personal use | _____  \n**37** | Cost of labor. Do not include any amounts paid to yourself | _____  \n**38** | Materials and supplies | _____  \n**39** | Other costs |   \n**40** | Add lines 35 through 39 | _____  \n**41** | Inventory at end of year |   \n**42** | **Cost of goods sold.** Subtract line 41 from line 40. Enter the result here and on line 4 |   \n#### Line 35—Inventory at Beginning of Year\nIf you are a merchant, beginning inventory is the cost of merchandise on hand at the beginning of the year that you will sell to customers. If you are a manufacturer or producer, it includes the total cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and materials and supplies used in manufacturing the goods (see _Inventories_ in chapter 2).\nOpening inventory will usually be identical to the closing inventory of the year before. You must explain any difference in a schedule attached to your return.\n**Donation of inventory.**\nIf you contribute inventory (property that you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can claim as a contribution deduction is the smaller of its fair market value on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of donated inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold.\nIf the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year.\nA special rule may apply to certain donations of food inventory. See Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.\n**Example 1.**\nYou are a calendar year taxpayer who uses an accrual method of accounting. In 2024, you contributed property from inventory to a church. It had a fair market value of $600. The closing inventory at the end of 2023 properly included $400 of costs due to the acquisition of the property, and in 2023, you properly deducted $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property as business expenses. The charitable contribution allowed for 2024 is $400 ($600 − $200). The $200 is the amount that would be ordinary income if you had sold the contributed inventory at fair market value on the date of the gift. The cost of goods sold you use in determining gross income for 2024 must not include the $400. You remove that amount from opening inventory for 2024.\n**Example 2.**\nIf, in _Example 1_ , you acquired the contributed property in 2024 at a cost of $400, you would include the $400 cost of the property in figuring the cost of goods sold for 2024 and deduct the $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property for that year. You would not be allowed any charitable contribution deduction for the contributed property.\n#### Line 36—Purchases Less Cost of Items Withdrawn for Personal Use\nIf you are a merchant, use the cost of all merchandise you bought for sale. If you are a manufacturer or producer, this includes the cost of all raw materials or parts purchased for manufacture into a finished product.\n**Trade discounts.**\nThe differences between the stated prices of articles and the actual prices you pay for them are called trade discounts. You must use the prices you pay (not the stated prices) in figuring your cost of purchases. Do not show the discount amount separately as an item in gross income.\nAn automobile dealer must record the cost of a car in inventory reduced by any manufacturer's rebate that represents a trade discount. \n**Cash discounts.**\nCash discounts are amounts your suppliers let you deduct from your purchase invoices for prompt payments. There are two methods of accounting for cash discounts. You can either credit them to a separate discount account or deduct them from total purchases for the year. Whichever method you use, you must be consistent. If you want to change your method of figuring inventory cost, you must file Form 3115. For more information, see _Change in Accounting Method_ in chapter 2.\nIf you credit cash discounts to a separate account, you must include this credit balance in your business income at the end of the tax year. If you use this method, do not reduce your cost of goods sold by the cash discounts.\n**Purchase returns and allowances.**\nYou must deduct all returns and allowances from your total purchases during the year.\n**Merchandise withdrawn from sale.**\nIf you withdraw merchandise for your personal or family use, you must exclude this cost from the total amount of merchandise you bought for sale. Do this by crediting the purchases or sales account with the cost of merchandise you withdraw for personal use. You must also charge the amount to your drawing account. \nA drawing account is a separate account you should keep to record the business income you withdraw to pay for personal and family expenses. As stated above, you also use it to record withdrawals of merchandise for personal or family use. This account is also known as a withdrawals account or personal account. \n#### Line 37—Cost of Labor\nLabor costs are usually an element of cost of goods sold only in a manufacturing or mining business. Small merchandisers (wholesalers, retailers, etc.) usually do not have labor costs that can properly be charged to cost of goods sold. In a manufacturing business, labor costs properly allocable to the cost of goods sold include both the direct and indirect labor used in fabricating the raw material into a finished, saleable product.\n**Direct labor.**\nDirect labor costs are the wages you pay to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. They also include a part of the wages you pay to employees who work directly on the product part time if you can determine that part of their wages. \n**Indirect labor.**\nIndirect labor costs are the wages you pay to employees who perform a general factory function that does not have any immediate or direct connection with making the saleable product, but that is a necessary part of the manufacturing process.\n**Other labor.**\nOther labor costs not properly chargeable to the cost of goods sold can be deducted as selling or administrative expenses. Generally, the only kinds of labor costs properly chargeable to your cost of goods sold are the direct or indirect labor costs and certain other costs treated as overhead expenses properly charged to the manufacturing process, as discussed later under _Line 39—Other Costs_.\n#### Line 38—Materials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies, such as hardware and chemicals, used in manufacturing goods are charged to cost of goods sold. Those that are not used in the manufacturing process are treated as deferred charges. You deduct them as a business expense when you use them. Business expenses are discussed in chapter 8.\n#### Line 39—Other Costs\nExamples of other costs incurred in a manufacturing or mining process that you charge to your cost of goods sold are as follows.\n**Containers.**\nContainers and packages that are an integral part of the product manufactured are a part of your cost of goods sold. If they are not an integral part of the manufactured product, their costs are shipping or selling expenses. \n**Freight-in.**\nFreight-in, express-in, and cartage-in on raw materials, supplies you use in production, and merchandise you purchase for sale are all part of cost of goods sold. \n**Overhead expenses.**\nOverhead expenses include expenses such as rent, heat, light, power, insurance, depreciation, taxes, maintenance, labor, and supervision. The overhead expenses you have as direct and necessary expenses of the manufacturing operation are included in your cost of goods sold. \n#### Line 40—Add Lines 35 Through 39\nThe total of lines 35 through 39 equals the cost of the goods available for sale during the year.\n#### Line 41—Inventory at End of Year\nSubtract the value of your closing inventory (including, as appropriate, the allocable parts of the cost of raw materials and supplies, direct labor, and overhead expenses) from line 40. Inventory at the end of the year is also known as closing or ending inventory. Your ending inventory will usually become the beginning inventory of your next tax year.\n#### Line 42—Cost of Goods Sold\nWhen you subtract your closing inventory (inventory at the end of the year) from the cost of goods available for sale, the remainder is your cost of goods sold during the tax year.", "zh": "## 6. 如何计算商品销售成本\n#### 介绍\n如果您制造或购买商品以进行销售，您可以在 附表 C 中从您的总收入中扣除商品销售成本。但是，要确定这些成本，您必须在每个纳税年度开始和结束时评估您的库存。\n如果您是制造商、批发商或零售商，或者如果您从事任何制造、购买或销售商品以产生收入的业务，则本章适用于您。本章不适用于个人服务业务，例如医生、律师、木匠或油漆工等业务。但是，如果您从事个人服务业务并且还销售您业务中通常使用的材料和用品或对其收费，则本章适用于您。\n#### 在附表 C 第 35 - 42 行 计算商品销售成本\n通过填写 附表 C 第 35-42 行来计算您的商品销售成本。这些行的内容见 下文并在 接下来的讨论中介绍。\n**35** | 年初库存。如果与去年的期末库存不同，请附上说明 | _____  \n---|---|---  \n**36** | 用购买价格减去撤回供个人使用的商品的成本所得的金额 | _____  \n**37** | 劳动力成本。不包括支付给您自己的任何款额 | _____  \n**38** | 材料和用品 | _____  \n**39** | 其他成本 |   \n**40** | 将第 35-39 行所列金额相加 | _____  \n**41** | 年末库存 |   \n**42** | **商品销售成本。** 用第 40 行所列金额减去第 41 行所列金额。 将结果输入此处和第 4 行 |   \n#### 第 35 行——年初库存\n如果您是商人，期初库存是指您将出售给客户的年初现有商品的成本。如果您是制造商或生产商，则它包括原材料、在制品、制成品以及制造商品所用材料和用品的总成本（请参阅第 2 章中的 _库存_ ）。\n期初库存通常与上一年的期末库存相同。您须在报税表随附的附表中说明任何差异。\n**捐赠库存。**\n如果您捐赠库存（您在业务过程中出售的财产），您可以申报为捐赠扣除额的金额是其在您捐赠之日的公平市场价值或其基数（以较小者为准）。捐赠库存的基数是上一年库存产生的、您将计入捐赠当年的期初库存中的任何成本。您须从期初库存中移除捐赠扣除额，它不构成商品销售成本的一部分。\n如未将捐赠库存成本计入期初库存中，则库存基数为零，您不能申报慈善捐赠扣除额。按照您通常采用的会计方法处理库存成本。例如，将当年购买和捐赠的库存的购买价格计入当年的商品销售成本中。\n特殊规定可能适用于特定食品捐赠库存。请参阅第 526 号刊物《慈善捐赠》。\n**示例 1。**\n您是使用应计会计处理方法的日历年度纳税人。2024 年，您将库存财产捐赠给了教会。它的公平市场价值为 600 美元。2023 年底的期末库存中正确计入了因收购该财产而产生的 400 美元成本，并且 2023 年，您适当地扣除了由该财产产生的 50 美元行政及其他支出作为营业支出。2024 年允许的慈善捐赠额为 400 美元（600 美元 - 200 美元）。如果您在赠送之日以公平市场价值出售了捐赠库存，那么 200 美元就是普通收入的金额。您用于确定 2024 年总收入的商品销售成本不得包括 400 美元。您从 2024 年的期初库存中移除该金额。\n**示例 2。**\n在 _示例 1_ 中，如果您 2024 年以 400 美元的成本获得了捐赠财产，您在计算 2024 年的商品销售成本时应计入该财产的 400 美元成本，并扣除当年由该财产产生的 50 美元行政及其他支出。您不得对捐赠财产进行任何慈善捐赠扣除。\n#### 第 36 行 —— 用购买价格减去撤回供个人使用的商品的成本所得的金额\n如果您是商人，请使用您为销售而购买的所有商品的成本。如果您是制造商或生产商，则应包括为制造成制成品而购买的所有原材料或零件的成本。\n**交易折扣。**\n商品标明价格与实际支付价格之间的差额称为交易折扣。计算购买成本时，您必须使用支付价格（而不是标明价格）。不要将折扣金额单独列为总收入中的一个项目。\n汽车经销商必须记录减去任何制造商回扣（代表交易折扣）后所得的汽车库存成本。\n**现金折扣。**\n现金折扣是指供应商允许您从购买发票中扣除以便及时付款的金额。处理现金折扣有两种会计方法。您可以将其记入单独的折扣账户，也可以从当年的总购买价格中扣除。无论使用哪种方法，都必须保持一致。如果要变更计算库存成本的方法，您必须提交 3115 表。有关更多信息，请参阅第 2 章中的 _会计方法变更_ 。\n如果您将现金折扣记入一个单独的账户，您必须将此贷记余额计入您在纳税年度结束时的营业收入中。如果您使用此方法，请不要通过现金折扣降低您的商品销售成本。\n**购买退款和津贴。**\n您必须从当年的总购买价格中扣除所有退款和津贴。\n**将商品撤回销售。**\n如果您撤回商品供个人或家庭使用，您必须从您购买用于销售的商品的总额中扣除此成本。为此，您可以将撤回供个人使用的商品的成本记入购买或销售账户中。您还须将此金额记入您的提款账户。 \n提款账户是一个单独的账户，您应该保留以记录您为支付个人和家庭支出而提取的营业收入。如上所述，您还可以使用它来记录供个人或家庭使用的商品的撤回情况。此账户也称为撤回账户或个人账户。\n#### 第 37 行 —— 劳动力成本\n劳动力成本通常只是制造或采矿业务中商品销售成本的一个要素。小型商家（批发商、零售商等）通常不会产生可以适当计入商品销售成本中的劳动力成本。在制造业务中，可适当分配到商品销售成本中的劳动力成本包括将原材料制造成可销售制成品所使用的直接和间接劳动力成本。\n**直接劳动力。**\n直接劳动力成本是指您支付给那些将所有时间直接用于制造产品的雇员的工资。其中还包括您支付给直接从事产品工作的兼职雇员的那部分工资，前提是您可以确定其对应部分的工资。\n**间接劳动力。**\n间接劳动力成本是指您支付给履行一般工厂职能的雇员的工资，这些职能与制造可销售产品没有任何直接联系，但构成制造过程的必要部分。\n**其他劳动力。**\n不能适当地计入商品销售成本中的其他劳动力成本可以作为销售或管理支出扣除。一般而言，唯一可以适当地计入商品销售成本中的劳动力成本是直接或间接劳动力成本以及被视为管理支出适当地计入制造过程的某些其他成本（如下文 _第 39 行 —— 其他成本_ 所述）。\n#### 第 38 行 —— 材料和用品\n制造商品所用的材料和用品（例如，硬件和化学品）计入商品销售成本中。未在制造过程中使用的费用作为递延费用处理。您在使用这些费用时将其作为营业支出扣除。营业支出在 第 8 章讨论。\n#### 第 39 行 —— 其他成本\n您计入商品销售成本中的在制造或采矿过程中产生的其他成本示例如下。\n**容器。**\n作为所制造产品的一个组成部分的容器和包装构成商品销售成本的一部分。如果不是所制造产品的一个组成部分，则其成本为运费或销售支出。\n**进货运费。**\n原材料、您在生产中使用的用品以及您为销售而购买的商品的进货运费、进货快递费和进货搬运费都构成商品销售成本的一部分。\n**管理支出。**\n管理支出包括租金、暖气费、照明费、电费、保险费、折旧费、税费、维护费、劳动力成本和监督费等支出。您产生的作为制造业务的直接必要支出的管理支出计入您的商品销售成本中。\n#### 第 40 行 —— 将第 35-39 行所列金额相加\n第 35-39 行所列金额的总和相当于当年可销售商品的成本。\n#### 第 41 行 —— 年末库存\n用第 40 行所列金额减去期末库存价值（酌情包括原材料和用品成本、直接劳动力成本和管理支出的可分配部分） 。年末库存也称为期末库存。期末库存通常为下一个纳税年度的期初库存。\n#### 第 42 行 —— 商品销售成本\n用可销售商品的成本减去期末库存（年末库存）所得的余额就是您在纳税年度的商品销售成本。", "article_id": "p334", "doc_idx": 0}
{"en": "## 7. Figuring Gross Profit\n#### Introduction\nAfter you have figured the gross receipts from your business (chapter 5) and the cost of goods sold (chapter 6), you are ready to figure your gross profit. You must determine gross profit before you can deduct any business expenses. These expenses are discussed in chapter 8.\n**Businesses that sell products.**\nFigure your gross profit by first figuring your net receipts. Figure net receipts (line 3) on Schedule C by subtracting any returns and allowances (line 2) from gross receipts (line 1). Returns and allowances include cash or credit refunds you make to customers, rebates, and other allowances off the actual sales price. \nNext, subtract the cost of goods sold (line 4) from net receipts (line 3). The result is the gross profit from your business. \n**Businesses that sell services.**\nYou do not have to figure the cost of goods sold if the sale of merchandise is not an income-producing factor for your business. Your gross profit is the same as your net receipts (gross receipts minus any refunds, rebates, or other allowances). Most professions and businesses that sell services rather than products can figure gross profit directly from net receipts in this way. \n**Illustration.**\nThis illustration of the gross profit section of the income statement of a retail business shows how gross profit is figured. \n**Income Statement Year Ended December 31, 2024 **\nGross receipts | $400,000  \n---|---  \nMinus: Returns and allowances | _14,940_  \nNet receipts | $385,060  \nMinus: Cost of goods sold | _288,140_  \n**Gross profit** | **$96,920**  \nThe cost of goods sold for this business is figured as follows. \nInventory at beginning of year | $37,845  \n---|---  \nPlus: Purchases | $285,900 |   \nMinus: Items withdrawn for personal use | _2,650_ | _283,250_  \nGoods available for sale | $321,095  \nMinus: Inventory at end of year | _32,955_  \n**Cost of goods sold** | **$288,140**  \n#### Items To Check\nConsider the following items before figuring your gross profit.\n**Gross receipts.**\nAt the end of each business day, make sure your records balance with your actual cash and credit receipts for the day. You may find it helpful to use cash registers to keep track of receipts. You should also use a proper invoicing system and keep a separate bank account for your business.\n**Sales tax collected.**\nCheck to make sure your records show the correct sales tax collected.\nIf you collect state and local sales taxes imposed on you as the seller of goods or services from the buyer, you must include the amount collected in gross receipts.\nIf you are required to collect state and local taxes imposed on the buyer and turn them over to state or local governments, you generally do not include these amounts in income.\n**Inventory at beginning of year.**\nCompare this figure with last year's ending inventory. The two amounts should usually be the same. \n**Purchases.**\nIf you take any inventory items for your personal use (use them yourself, provide them to your family, or give them as personal gifts, etc.), be sure to remove them from the cost of goods sold. For details on how to adjust cost of goods sold, see _Merchandise withdrawn from sale_ in chapter 6. \n**Inventory at end of year.**\nCheck to make sure your procedures for taking inventory are adequate. These procedures should ensure all items have been included in inventory and proper pricing techniques have been used.\nUse inventory forms and adding machine tapes as the only evidence for your inventory. Inventory forms are available at office supply stores. These forms have columns for recording the description, quantity, unit price, and value of each inventory item. Each page has space to record who made the physical count, who priced the items, who made the extensions, and who proofread the calculations. These forms will help you confirm that the total inventory is accurate. They will also provide you with a permanent record to support its validity. \nInventories are discussed in chapter 2.\n#### Testing Gross Profit Accuracy\nIf you are in a retail or wholesale business, you can check the accuracy of your gross profit figure. First, divide gross profit by net receipts. The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price.\nNext, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.\n_**Example.**_\nYou operate a retail business. On the average, you mark up your merchandise so that you will realize a gross profit of 331/3% on its sales. The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on your income statement are $300,000. Your cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 − $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, you divide gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000). The resulting 331/3% confirms your markup percentage of 331/3%.\n#### Additions to Gross Profit\nIf your business has income from a source other than its regular business operations, enter the income on line 6 of Schedule C and add it to gross profit. The result is gross business income. Some examples include income from an interest-bearing checking account, income from scrap sales, income from certain fuel tax credits and refunds, and amounts recovered from bad debts.\n#### Introduction\nThis publication provides general information about the federal tax laws that apply to you if you are a self-employed person or a statutory employee.

{"en": "#### Self-Employment (SE) Tax\nSE tax is a social security and Medicare tax primarily for individuals who work for themselves. It is similar to the social security and Medicare taxes withheld from the pay of most wage earners.\n**Social security coverage.**\nSocial security benefits are available to self-employed persons just as they are to wage earners. Your payments of SE tax contribute to your coverage under the social security system. Social security coverage provides you with retirement benefits, disability benefits, survivor benefits, and hospital insurance (Medicare) benefits.\n_**How to become insured under social security.**_\nYou must be insured under the social security system before you begin receiving social security benefits. You are insured if you have the required number of credits (also called quarters of coverage), discussed next. \n_**Earning credits in 2024 and 2025.**_\nFor 2024, you received one credit, up to a maximum of four credits, for each $1,730 ($1,810 for 2025) of income subject to social security tax. Therefore, for 2024, if you had income (self-employment and wages) of $6,920 that was subject to social security tax, you received four credits ($6,920 ÷ $1,730). \nFor an explanation of the number of credits you must have to be insured and the benefits available to you and your family under the social security program, consult your nearest SSA office.\n**The SSA time limit for posting self-employment income.**\nGenerally, the SSA will give you credit only for self-employment income reported on a tax return filed within 3 years, 3 months, and 15 days after the tax year you earned the income. If you file your tax return or report a change in your self-employment income after this time limit, the SSA may change its record but only to remove or reduce the amount. The SSA will not change its records to increase your self-employment income. \n**Who must pay SE tax.**\nYou must pay SE tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040) if either of the following applies. \n  1. Your net earnings from self-employment (excluding church employee income) were $400 or more.\n  2. You had church employee income of $108.28 or more. \n**SE tax rate.**\nThe SE tax rate on net earnings is 15.3% (12.4% social security tax plus 2.9% Medicare tax). \n**Maximum earnings subject to SE tax.**\nOnly the first $168,600 of your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 is subject to any combination of the 12.4% social security part of SE tax, social security tax, or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax. \nAll your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 are subject to any combination of the 2.9% Medicare part of SE tax, Medicare tax, or Medicare part of railroad retirement tax.\nIf wages and tips you receive as an employee are subject to either social security tax or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax, or both, and total at least $168,600, do not pay the 12.4% social security part of the SE tax on any of your net earnings. However, you must pay the 2.9% Medicare part of the SE tax on all your net earnings.\n**Additional Medicare Tax.**\nA 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax may apply to you if your net earnings from self-employment exceed one of the following threshold amounts (based on your filing status).\n  * Married filing jointly—$250,000\n  * Married filing separately—$125,000\n  * Single, Head of household, or Qualifying surviving spouse—$200,000\nIf you have both wages and self-employment income, the threshold amount for applying the Additional Medicare Tax on the self-employment income is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. Use Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax, to figure this tax.\n**More information.**\nFor information on methods of calculating SE tax, see chapter 10 Tax\").\n##### Table 1-2.

While Direct File doesn't prepare state returns, if you live in a participating state, Direct File guides you to a state-supported tool you can use to prepare and file your state tax return for free. Go to IRS.gov/DirectFile for more information, program updates, and frequently asked questions.\n  * **Free File.** This program lets you prepare and file your federal individual income tax return for free using software or Free File Fillable Forms. However, state tax preparation may not be available through Free File. Go to IRS.gov/FreeFile to see if you qualify for free online federal tax preparation, e-filing, and direct deposit or payment options.\n  * **VITA.** The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax help to people with low-to-moderate incomes, persons with disabilities, and limited-English-speaking taxpayers who need help preparing their own tax returns.

A paid tax preparer is:\n  * Primarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return, \n  * Required to sign the return, and\n  * Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n**Employers can register to use Business Services Online.**\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and individuals who process Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement; and Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.\n**Business tax account.**\nIf you are a sole proprietor, a partnership, or an S corporation, you can view your tax information on record with the IRS and do more with a business tax account.

For more information, go to IRS.gov/TaxProAccount.\n**Using direct deposit.**\nThe safest and easiest way to receive a tax refund is to e-file and choose direct deposit, which securely and electronically transfers your refund directly into your financial account.

If you don’t have a bank account, go to IRS.gov/DirectDeposit for more information on where to find a bank or credit union that can open an account online.\n**Reporting and resolving your tax-related identity theft issues.**\n  * Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be affected if your SSN is used to file a fraudulent return or to claim a refund or credit.\n  * The IRS doesn’t initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify personal or financial information. This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.\n  * Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n  * Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to taxpayers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax returns. When you have an IP PIN, it prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN.\n**Ways to check on the status of your refund.**\n  * Go to IRS.gov/Refunds.\n  * Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status.\n  * Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. \n**Making a tax payment.**\nPayments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the IRS in U.S. dollars.

{"en": "#### Rule 9—Your Qualifying Child Cannot Be Used by More Than One Person To Claim the EIC\nSometimes a child meets the tests to be a qualifying child of more than one person. However, only one of these persons can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. Only that person can use the child as a qualifying child to take all of the following tax benefits (provided the person is eligible for each benefit).\n  1. The child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit.\n  2. Head of household filing status. \n  3. The credit for child and dependent care expenses.\n  4. The exclusion for dependent care benefits.\n  5. The EIC.\nThe other person can’t take any of these benefits based on this qualifying child. In other words, you and the other person can’t agree to divide these tax benefits between you. The other person can’t take any of these tax benefits unless that person has a different qualifying child. \nThe tiebreaker rules, which follow, explain who, if anyone, can claim the EIC when more than one person has the same qualifying child. However, the tiebreaker rules don't apply if the other person is your spouse and you file a joint return.\n**Tiebreaker rules.**\nTo determine which person can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the five tax benefits just listed, the following tiebreaker rules apply. For purposes of these tiebreaker rules, the term “parent” means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It does not include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.\n  * If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.\n  * If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.\n  * If the parents don't file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher AGI for the year.\n  * If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year.\n  * If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent claims the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of the child's parents who can claim the child.\nSubject to these tiebreaker rules, you and the other person may be able to choose which of you claims the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 1 through 12.\nIf you can’t claim the EIC because your qualifying child is treated under the tiebreaker rules as the qualifying child of another person for 2024, you may be able to take the EIC using a different qualifying child, or take the EIC using the rules in chapter 3 for people who don't have a qualifying child.\n**If the other person cannot claim the EIC.**\nIf you and someone else have the same qualifying child but the other person can’t claim the EIC because the other person isn't eligible or their earned income or AGI is too high, you may be able to treat the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 6 and 7. But you can’t treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the EIC if the other person uses the child to claim any of the other five tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter.\n**Examples.**\nThe following examples may help you in determining whether you can claim the EIC when you and someone else have the same qualifying child.\n**Example 1—Child lived with parent and grandparent.**\nYou and your 2-year-old child Sam lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. Your only income was $9,000 from a part-time job. Your parent's only income was $22,000 from a job, and their AGI is $22,000. Your child’s other parent did not live with you or Sam. The special rule explained later for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply. Sam is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Sam meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only one of you can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and the other tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter for which that person qualifies). Sam isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, including the child’s other parent. If you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which your parent qualifies).\n**Example 2—Parent has higher AGI than grandparent.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your AGI is $25,000. Because your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your parent can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only you can claim Sam.\n**Example 3—Two persons claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you and your parent both claim Sam as a qualifying child. In this case, you as the child's parent will be the only one allowed to claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC and the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier based on Sam. Your parent can't take the EIC for a taxpayer without a qualifying child because your parent’s AGI is more than $18,591.\n**Example 4—Qualifying children split between two persons.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you also have two other young children who are qualifying children of both you and your parent. Only one of you can claim each child. However, if your parent's AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your parent to claim one or more of the children. For example, if you claim one child, your parent can claim the other two.\n**Example 5—Taxpayer who is a qualifying child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you are only 18 years old. This means you are a qualifying child of your parent. Because of _Rule 10_ , discussed next, you can’t claim the EIC and can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only your parent may be able to treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC. If your parent meets all the other requirements for claiming the EIC and you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can claim both you and Sam as qualifying children for the EIC.\n**Example 6—Grandparent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that your parent earned $50,000 from employment. Because your parent's earned income is too high for your parent to claim the EIC, only you can claim the EIC using Sam.\n**Example 7—Parent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you earned $50,000 from your job and your AGI is $50,500. Your earned income is too high for you to claim the EIC. But your parent can’t claim the EIC either, because your parent’s AGI isn't higher than yours.\n**Example 8—Separated parents.**\nYou, your spouse, and your 10-year-old child, Jordan, lived together until August 1, 2024, when your spouse moved out of the household. In August and September, Jordan lived with you. For the rest of the year, Jordan lived with Jordan's other parent. Jordan is a qualifying child of both you and your spouse because Jordan lived with each of you for more than half the year and because Jordan met the relationship, age, and joint return tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written separation agreement, so the _Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_.\") doesn't apply. \nYou and your spouse will file separate returns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This means, if your spouse doesn't claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any of the tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any tax benefit listed earlier for which you qualify. However, you can't take the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and, while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet the requirements for certain separated spouses to take the EIC when they don’t file a joint return. See Rule 3. You also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.\n**Example 9—Separated parents claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 8_ , except that you and your spouse both claim Jordan as a qualifying child. In this case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This is because, during 2024, Jordan lived with your spouse longer than with you. You can’t claim the EIC because you are a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return and you don’t have a qualifying child. However, your spouse's filing status is also married filing separately, so your spouse can’t claim the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 or you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn't meet the requirements to claim the EIC as a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return. See Rule 3. Your spouse also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your spouse’s filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.\n**Example 10—Unmarried parents.**\nYou, your 5-year-old child, Logan, and Logan’s other parent lived together all year. You and Logan’s other parent aren't married. Logan is a qualifying child of both you and Logan’s other parent because Logan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and Logan’s other parent. Your earned income and AGI are $12,000, and Logan’s other parent’s earned income and AGI are $14,000. Neither of you had any other income. Logan’s other parent agrees to let you treat the child as a qualifying child. This means if Logan’s other parent doesn't claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify.\n**Example 11—Unmarried parents claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 10_ except that you and Logan’s other parent both claim Logan as a qualifying child. In this case, only Logan’s other parent will be allowed to treat Logan as a qualifying child. This is because Logan’s other parent’s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, $12,000. You can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.\n**Example 12—Child did not live with a parent.**\nYou and your sibling’s child, Morgan, lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your only income was from a part-time job. Your parent’s AGI is $15,000. Your parent’s only income was from a job. Morgan’s parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and don't live with you or Morgan. Morgan is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Morgan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only your parent can treat Morgan as a qualifying child. This is because your parent’s AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.\n**Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).**\nA child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all of the following statements are true.\n  1. The parents:\n    1. Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;\n    2. Are separated under a written separation agreement; or\n    3. Lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024.\n  2. The child received over half of the child’s support for the year from the parents.\n  3. The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of 2024.\n  4. Either of the following statements is true.\n    1. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that the custodial parent will not claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches the form or statement to their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. \n    2. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024.\nFor details, see Pub. 501. If a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under this special rule for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), only the noncustodial parent can claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents for the child. However, only the custodial parent, if eligible, or another eligible taxpayer can claim the child as a qualifying child for the EIC.

EIC。**\n如果您和其他人拥有同一合条件子女，但其他人因不符合条件或者其劳动所得或 AGI 太高而不能申报 EIC，则您可以将该子女视为合条件子女。请参阅示例 6 和示例 7。但是，如果其他人凭借该子女来申请本章上文列出的任何其他五项税收福利，则您不能凭借该子女的合条件子女身份来申报 EIC。\n**示例。**\n以下示例可以帮助您确定当您和其他人拥有同一合条件子女时，您能否申报 EIC。\n**示例 1——子女与父母和祖父母同住。**\n您和您 2 岁的子女 Sam 全年都与您母亲同住。您 25 岁，未婚，您的 AGI 为 9,000 美元。您的唯一收入是兼职工作获得的 9,000 美元。您父母的唯一收入是工作获得的 22,000 美元，而其 AGI 是 22,000 美元。您子女的另一方父母未与您和 Sam 同住。下文介绍的适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定不适用。Sam 是您和您父母的合条件子女，因为 Sam 通过了针对您和您父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。但是，您和您父母只有一人可以凭借其合条件子女身份来申报 EIC（以及本章上文列出的该人有资格享受的其他税收福利）。Sam 不属于任何其他人的合条件子女，包括其另一方父母。如果您未为了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以凭借其合条件子女身份来申报 EIC（以及上文列出的您父母有资格享受的任何其他税收福利）。\n**示例 2——父母的 AGI 比祖父母高。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的 AGI 是 25,000 美元。因为您父母的 AGI 并不比您高，所以您父母不能将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。只有您可以将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。\n**示例 3——两人同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和您父母同时将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，您作为 Sam 的父母将是唯一被允许为了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有资格享受的其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女的人。IRS 将不允许您父母凭借 Sam 来申报 EIC 以及上文列出的任何其他税收福利。您父母不能享受无任何合条件子女的纳税人可享受的 EIC，因为您父母的 AGI 超过了 18,591 美元。\n**示例 4——两人共同分配合条件子女。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您还有另外两个年幼的子女，他们都是您和您父母的合条件子女。每个子女仅供您和您父母中的一人申报为合条件子女。但是，如果您父母的 AGI 比您高，您可以让您父母将一个或多个子女申报为合条件子女。例如，如果您将一个子女申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以将另外两个子女申报为合条件子女。\n**示例 5——合条件子女为纳税人。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您只有 18 岁。这意味着您是您父母的合条件子女。根据接下来要讨论的 _第 10 条规则_ ，您不能申报 EIC，也不能将 Sam 申报为合条件子女。只有您父母可以凭借 Sam 的合条件子女身份来申报 EIC。如果您父母符合申报 EIC 的所有其他要求，而您未为了享受上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Sam 申报为合条件子女，则您父母可以为了享受 EIC 而将您和 Sam 同时申报为合条件子女。\n**示例 6——祖父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您父母的工作收入是 50,000 美元。您父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC，因此只有您可以凭借 Sam 申报 EIC。\n**示例 7——父母因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。**\n事实与 _示例 1_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的工作收入是 50,000 美元，您的 AGI 是 50,500 美元。您因劳动所得太高而不能申报 EIC。但是您父母也不能申报 EIC，因为您父母的 AGI 并不比您高。\n**示例 8——父母分居。**\n您、您配偶和您 10 岁的子女 Jordan 一直同住，直到 2024 年 8 月 1 日您配偶搬出去。8 月和 9 月，Jordan 和您同住。在这一年剩下的时间里，Jordan 和您配偶（Jordan 的另一方父母）同住。Jordan 同时是您和您配偶的合条件子女，因为 Jordan 和您们两人都同住了半年以上的时间，而且 Jordan 通过了针对您们俩的关系、年龄和联合报税表测试。到年底时，您和您配偶仍未离异、合法分居或根据书面分居协议进行分居，所以 _适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定_ 不适用。 \n您和您配偶将分别提交单独报税表。您配偶同意让您将 Jordan 视为合条件子女。这意味着，如果您配偶未为了享受上文列出的任何税收福利而将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女，则您可以为了享受上文列出的您有资格享受的任何税收福利而将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女。但是，您不能获取 EIC，因为您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分居，而且，虽然您们在 2024 年底确实分居，但您们并没有根据书面分居协议或单独抚养令合法分居。因此，您不符合某些分居配偶在不提交联合申报表的情况下享受 EIC 的要求。请参阅第 3 条规则。您也不能享受子女和被抚养人护理费用抵免，因为您的申报身份是已婚分别申报，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住。请参阅 503 号刊物。\n**示例 9——分居父母双方同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**\n事实与 _示例 8_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和您配偶同时将 Jordan 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，只有您配偶可以将 Jordan 视为合条件子女。这是因为，Jordan 2024 年与您配偶同住的时间比与您同住的时间长。您不能申报 EIC，因为您是没有联合报税的分居配偶，而且您没有一个符合条件的孩子。但是，您配偶的申报身份也是已婚分别申报，所以您配偶不能申报 EIC，因为您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住，或者您们没有根据书面分居协议或分开抚养的法令合法分居。因此，您配偶作为没有提交联合报税表的分居配偶，不符合申报 EIC 的要求。请参阅第 3 条规则。您配偶也不能享受子女和被抚养人护理费用抵免，因为您配偶的申报身份是已婚分别申报，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最后 6 个月没有分开居住。请参阅 503 号刊物。\n**示例 10——父母未婚。**\n您、您 5 岁的子女 Logan 以及您子女的另一方父母全年同住。您和 Logan 的另一方父母未婚。Logan 是您和 Logan 的另一方父母的合条件子女，因为 Logan 通过了针对您和 Logan 另一方父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。您的劳动所得和 AGI 均为 12,000 美元，Logan 的另一方父母的劳动所得和 AGI 均为 14,000 美元。您们都没有任何其他收入。Logan 的另一方父母同意让您将 Logan 视为合条件子女。这意味着，如果 Logan 的另一方父母没有为了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他税收福利而将 Logan 申报为合条件子女，则您可以为了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有资格享受的任何其他税收福利而将 Logan 申报为合条件子女。\n**示例 11——未婚父母双方同时将同一子女申报为合条件子女。**\n事实与 _示例 10_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您和 Logan 的另一方父母同时将 Logan 申报为合条件子女。在这种情况下，只有 Logan 的另一方父母可以将 Logan 视为合条件子女。这是因为其 AGI（14,000 美元）比您的 AGI（12,000 美元）高。您可以申请无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。\n**示例 12——子女未与父母同住。**\n您和您兄弟姐妹的子女 Morgan 全年都与您父母同住。您今年 25 岁，您的 AGI 为 9,300 美元。您通过兼职工作获得唯一收入。您父母的 AGI 是 15,000 美元。您父母通过工作获得唯一收入。Morgan 的父母联合报税，他们的 AGI 低于 9,000 美元，并且他们不与您和 Morgan 同住。Morgan 同时是您和您父母的合条件子女，因为 Morgan 通过了针对您和您父母的关系、年龄、居住地和联合报税表测试。但是，只有您父母可以将 Morgan 视为合条件子女。这是因为您父母的 AGI（15,000 美元）比您的 AGI（9,300 美元）高。\n**适用于离异或分居父母的特殊规定。**\n如果以下所有陈述均属实，则相关子女将被视为其非监护父母的合条件子女。\n  1. 父母：\n    1. 根据离婚或单独赡养法令进行离婚或合法分居；\n    2. 根据书面分居协议进行分居；或者\n    3. 在 2024 年的最后 6 个月内一直分居。\n  2. 子女在这一年里从父母那里获得了一半以上的抚养费。\n  3. 子女 2024 年有一半以上的时间由父母一方或双方监护。\n  4. 以下任一陈述均属实。\n    1. 监护父母签署表格 8332

{"en": "## 3. Rules if You Do Not Have a Qualifying Child\nUse this chapter if you don't have a qualifying child and have met all the rules in chapter 1. This chapter discusses _Rules 11_ through _14_. You must meet all four of these rules, in addition to the rules in chapters 1 and 4, to qualify for the EIC without a qualifying child. If you meet all the rules in chapter 1 and this chapter, read chapter 4 to find out what to do next.\n**If you have a qualifying child.**\nIf you meet _Rule 8_ , you have a qualifying child. If you meet _Rule 8_ and don't claim the EIC with a qualifying child, you can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.\n#### Rule 11—You Must Meet the Age Requirements\nYou must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. If you are married filing a joint return, either you or your spouse must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. It doesn't matter which spouse meets the age test, as long as one of the spouses does.\nYou meet the age test if you were born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000. If you are married filing a joint return, you meet the age test if either you or your spouse was born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000.\nIf neither you nor your spouse meets the age test, you can't claim the EIC. Enter \"No\" on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**Example 1.**\nYou are age 28 and unmarried. You meet the age test.\n**Example 2—Spouse meets age test.**\nYou are married and filing a joint return. You are age 23 and your spouse is age 27. You meet the age test because your spouse is at least age 25 but under age 65.\n**Death of spouse.**\nIf you are filing a joint return with your spouse who died in 2024, you meet the age test if you are at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024, or your spouse was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.\nYour spouse is considered to reach age 25 on the day before their 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; your spouse reaches age 65 on their 65th birthday.\nEven if your spouse was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.\n_**Example 1.**_\nYou are married and filing a joint return with your spouse who died in August 2024. You are age 67. Your spouse would have become age 65 in November 2024. Because your spouse was under age 65 at the time of death, you meet the age test.\n**Example 2.**\nYour spouse was born on February 14, 1999, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 25 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 25 at the time of death and isn't at least age 25 at the end of 2024.\n**Death of taxpayer.**\nA taxpayer who died in 2024 meets the age test if the taxpayer was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.\nA taxpayer is considered to reach age 25 on the day before the taxpayer’s 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; a taxpayer reaches age 65 on the taxpayer’s 65th birthday.\nEven if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.\n#### Rule 12—You Cannot Be the Dependent of Another Person\nIf you **aren't** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check the box under your name that says \"Someone can claim you as a dependent.\"\nIf you **are** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check either box that says \"Someone can claim you as a dependent\" or \"Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent.\"\nIf you aren't sure whether someone else can claim you as a dependent, get Pub. 501 and read the rules for claiming a dependent.\nIf someone else can claim you as a dependent on their return, but doesn't, you still can’t claim the credit unless the person who can claim you on their tax return isn't required to file an income tax return and doesn't file a tax return or files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.\n**Example 1.**\nIn 2024, you were age 25, single, and living at home with your parents. You worked and weren't a student. You earned $7,500. Your parents can’t claim you as a dependent. When you file your return, you do not check the \"Someone can claim you as a dependent\" checkbox. You meet this rule. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements.\n**Example 2.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ , except that you earned $2,000. Your parents can claim you as a dependent but decide not to. You don't meet this rule. You can’t claim the credit because your parents could have claimed you as a dependent.\n**Joint returns.**\nYou generally can’t be claimed as a dependent by another person if you are married and file a joint return.\nHowever, another person may be able to claim you as a dependent if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be claimed as a dependent by another person if you claim the EIC on your joint return.\n**Example 1—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**\nYou are 26 years old. You and your spouse live with your parents and had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. Neither you nor your spouse is required to file a tax return. You don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of your pay so you file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. Your parents aren't disqualified from claiming you as a dependent just because you filed a joint return.\n**Example 2—Return filed to get EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except no taxes were taken out of your pay. Also, you and your spouse aren't required to file a tax return, but you file a joint return to claim an EIC of $63 and get a refund of that amount. Because claiming the EIC is your reason for filing the return, you aren't filing it only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. Your parents can’t claim you or your spouse as a dependent.\n#### Rule 13—You Cannot Be a Qualifying Child of Another Taxpayer\nYou are a qualifying child of another taxpayer (your parent, guardian, foster parent, etc.) if all of the following statements are true.\n  1. You are that person's son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them. Or, you are that person's brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them. \n  2. You were:\n    1. Under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly);\n    2. Under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly); or\n    3. Permanently and totally disabled, regardless of age.\n  3. You lived with that person in the United States for more than half of the year.\n  4. You aren't filing a joint return for the year (or are filing a joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).\nFor more details about the tests to be a qualifying child, see Rule 8. \nIf you are a qualifying child of another taxpayer, you can’t claim the EIC. This is true even if the person for whom you are a qualifying child doesn't claim the EIC or meet all of the rules to claim the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**Example.**\nYou lived with your parent all year. You are age 26, unmarried, and permanently and totally disabled. Your only income was from a community center where you went 3 days a week to answer telephones. You earned $5,000 for the year and provided more than half of your own support. Because you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests, you are a qualifying child of your parent for the EIC. Your parent can claim the EIC if your parent meets all the other requirements. Because you are a qualifying child of your parent, you can’t claim the EIC. This is so even if your parent can’t or doesn’t claim the EIC.\n**Joint returns.**\nYou generally can’t be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you are married and file a joint return.\nHowever, you may be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you claim the EIC on your joint return.\n**Child of person not required to file a return.**\nYou aren't the qualifying child of another taxpayer (and so may qualify to claim the EIC) if the person for whom you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests isn't required to file an income tax return and either:\n  * Doesn't file an income tax return, or\n  * Files a return only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\n**Example 1—Return not required.**\nYou lived all year with your parent. You are 27 years old, unmarried, permanently and totally disabled, and earned $13,000. You have no other income, no children, and provided more than half of your own support. Your parent had no gross income, isn't required to file a 2024 tax return, and doesn't file a 2024 tax return. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.\n**Example 2—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your parent had wages of $1,500 and had income tax withheld from wages. Your parent files a return only to get a refund of the income tax withheld and doesn't claim the EIC or any other tax credits or deductions. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.\n**Example 3—Return filed to get EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 2_ except your parent claimed the EIC on their return. Since your parent filed the return to get the EIC, your parent isn't filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld. As a result, you are your parent’s qualifying child. You can’t claim the EIC.\n#### Rule 14—You Must Have Lived in the United States More Than Half of the Year\nYour home (and your spouse's if filing a joint return) must have been in the United States for more than half the year. \nIf it wasn't, enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**United States.**\nThis means the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It doesn't include Puerto Rico or U.S. territories such as Guam.\n**Homeless shelter.**\nYour home can be any location where you regularly live. You don't need a traditional home. If you lived in one or more homeless shelters in the United States for more than half the year, you meet this rule. \n**Military personnel stationed outside the United States.**\nU.S. military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty (defined in chapter 2) are considered to live in the United States during that duty period for purposes of the EIC.

For more information, see Form 8862 and its instructions.\nThis chapter also explains the rules for certain people who can’t claim the EIC for a period of years after their EIC was denied or reduced.\n#### Form 8862\nIf your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error, you must attach a completed Form 8862 to your next tax return to claim the EIC. You must also qualify to claim the EIC by meeting all the rules described in this publication.\n**Exception 1.**\nDon't file Form 8862 if either (1) or (2) below is true.\n  1. After your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year:\n    1. You filed Form 8862 in a later year and your EIC for that later year was allowed, and\n    2. Your EIC hasn't been reduced or disallowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.\n  2. You are claiming the EIC without a qualifying child for 2024 and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year was because the IRS determined that a child listed on Schedule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.\nIn either of these cases, you can take the EIC without filing Form 8862 if you meet all the EIC eligibility requirements.\n**Exception 2.**\nDon't file Form 8862 or take the EIC for:\n  * 2 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or \n  * 10 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud. \n**More information.**\nFor details, see _Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?_ in this chapter.\nThe date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect whether you need to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return or to a later return. The following examples demonstrate whether Form 8862 is required for 2024 or 2025.\n**Example 1—Form 8862 required for 2024.**\nYou filed your 2023 tax return in March 2024 and claimed the EIC with a qualifying child. The IRS questioned the EIC, and you were unable to prove the child was a qualifying child. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you that an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. To claim the EIC with a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to that return. However, to claim the EIC without a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you don't need to file Form 8862.\n**Example 2—Form 8862 required for 2025.**\nThe facts are the same as in the previous example except that you received the statutory notice of deficiency in February 2025. Because the 90-day period referred to in the statutory notice isn't over when you are ready to file your return for 2024, you shouldn't attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return. However, to claim the EIC with a qualifying child for 2025, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year. To claim the EIC without a qualifying child for 2025, you don't need to file Form 8862.\n**Exception for math or clerical errors.**\nIf your EIC was denied or reduced as a result of a math or clerical error, don't attach Form 8862 to your next tax return. For example, if your arithmetic is incorrect, the IRS can correct it. If you don't provide a correct SSN, the IRS can deny the EIC. These types of errors are called math or clerical errors. \n**Omission of Form 8862.**\nIf you are required to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 tax return, and you claim the EIC without attaching a completed Form 8862, your claim will be automatically denied. This is considered a math or clerical error. You won't be permitted to claim the EIC without a completed Form 8862.\n**Additional documents may be required.**\nYou may have to provide the IRS with additional documents or information before a refund relating to the EIC you claim is released to you, even if you attach a properly completed Form 8862 to your return.\n#### Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?\nIf your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied and it was determined that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 2 years. If your error was due to fraud, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 10 years. The date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect the years for which you are prohibited from claiming the EIC. The following examples demonstrate which years you are prohibited from claiming the EIC.\n**Example 3—Cannot claim EIC for 2 years.**\nYou claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in March 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2024 or 2025. To claim the EIC on your return for 2026, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\n**Example 4.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 3_ , except that your 2023 EIC wasn’t denied until after you filed your 2024 return. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2025 or 2026. To claim the EIC on your return for 2027, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\n**Example 5—Cannot claim EIC for 10 years.**\nYou claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in February 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to fraud. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax years 2024 through 2033. To claim the EIC on your return for 2034, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\nIf you disagree with the final determination of the IRS that you are prohibited from claiming the EIC for a period of years and want to appeal this determination, see the Instructions for Form 8862, _How to appeal the disallowance period_.", "zh": "## 5. 禁用 EIC\n本章适用于 IRS 自 1996 年起驳回或减少其任一年的 EIC 金额的人士。如果此规定适用于您，您 2024 年可能需要填写表格 8862《被禁用后申请特定抵免所需的信息》并将其附在您的 2024 年报税表中才能申请抵免。本章介绍了何时需要附上表格 8862。有关更多信息，请参阅表格 8862 及其说明。\n本章还介绍了适用于在其 EIC 金额被驳回或减少后几年内不能申报 EIC 的特定人士的规则。\n#### 表格 8862\n如果自 1996 年起您任一年的 EIC 金额因数学错误或笔误以外的任何原因被驳回或减少，您必须将填好的表格 8862 附在您的下一份报税表中才能申报 EIC。您还必须符合本刊物中所述的所有规则，才有资格申报 EIC。\n**例外情况 1。**\n如果以下 (1) 或 (2) 属实，请勿提交表格 8862。\n  1. 您的 EIC 金额在上一年被减少或禁用后：\n    1. 您在下一年提交了表格 8862，并且您下一年的 EIC 金额被禁用了；以及\n    2. 您的 EIC 金额未因数学错误或笔误以外的任何原因再次被减少或禁用。\n  2. 您 2024 年可申报无合格条件子女时可申报的 EIC，并且您的 EIC 金额在上一年被减少或禁用的唯一原因是 IRS 认定附表 EIC 中列出的子女不是您的合条件子女。\n在上述任一情况下，如果您符合所有 EIC 资格要求，您无需提交表格 8862 即可享受 EIC。\n**例外情况 2。**\n在以下时间内，请勿提交表格 8862 或享受 EIC：\n  * 在最终确定您是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则而提出 EIC 申请后 2 年内；或者 \n  * 在最终确定您是由于实施欺诈行为而提出 EIC 申请后 10 年内。 \n**更多信息。**\n有关详细信息，请参阅本章中的 _您是否数年内不得申报 EIC？_ 。\n您的 EIC 金额被驳回的日期以及您提交 2024 年报税表的日期会影响您需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表还是之后的报税表中。以下示例说明了需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表还是 2025 年报税表中。\n**示例 1——需要将表格 8862 附在 2024 年报税表中。**\n您于 2024 年 3 月提交了 2023 年报税表，并申请了有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。IRS 质疑您的 EIC 金额，而您无法证明所述子女是合条件子女。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在 2024 年报税表中，才能在该报税表中申请有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。但是，您无需提交表格 8862，即可在 2024 年报税表中申请无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。\n**示例 2——需要将表格 8862 附在 2025 年报税表中。**\n事实与上一示例所述事实相同，不同的是您于 2025 年 2 月收到了法定欠款通知。由于法定通知中提到的 90 天期限在您准备提交 2024 年报税表时尚未结束，因此您不应在 2024 年报税表中附上表格 8862。但是，您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您的 2025 年报税表中，才能申请有一个合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。您无需提交表格 8862，即可申报 2025 年无任何合条件子女时可申请的 EIC。\n**数学错误或笔误的例外情况。**\n如果您的 EIC 金额因数学错误或笔误而被驳回或减少，请勿将表格 8862 附在您的下一份报税表中。例如，如果您的算术不正确，IRS 可予纠正。如果您未提供正确的社会安全号码，IRS 可以驳回 EIC 金额。上述类型的错误被称为数学错误或笔误。 \n**遗漏表格 8862。**\n如果您必须在 2024 年报税表中附上表格 8862，但您在申报 EIC 时未附上填好的表格 8862，则您的申请将被自动驳回。这被视为数学错误或笔误。如未附上填好的表格 8862，则不得申报 EIC。\n**可能还需要其他文件。**\n即使您已将正确填好的表格 8862 附在了您的报税表中，您可能还必须向 IRS 提供其他文件或信息，IRS 才会向您发放与您申请的 EIC 相关的退款。\n#### 您是否数年内不得申报 EIC？\n如果自 1996 年起您任一年的 EIC 金额被驳回，并且确定您的错误是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则造成的，则您在接下来 2 年内不能申报 EIC。如果您的错误是由于实施欺诈行为造成的，则您在接下来 10 年内不能申报 EIC。您的 EIC 金额被驳回的日期以及您提交 2024 年报税表的日期会影响您不得申报 EIC 的年数。以下示例说明了您不得申报 EIC 的年数。\n**示例 3——2 年内不能申报 EIC。**\n您在 2024 年 3 月提交的 2023 年报税表中申请了 EIC。IRS 认定您无权享受 EIC，并且您的错误是由于鲁莽或故意无视 EIC 规则造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您在 2024 或 2025 纳税年度不能申报 EIC。要在 2026 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。\n**示例 4。**\n事实与 _示例 3_ 所述事实相同，不同的是您的 2023 年 EIC 金额在您提交 2024 年报税表后才被驳回。您在 2025 或 2026 纳税年度不能申报 EIC。要在 2027 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。\n**示例 5——10 年内不能申报 EIC。**\n您在 2024 年 2 月提交的 2023 年报税表中申请了 EIC。IRS 认定您无权享受 EIC，并且您的错误是由于实施欺诈行为造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠款通知，告知您除非您在 90 天内向税务法院提交申诉书，否则将进行调整并评估税款。您未在 90 天内对此通知采取行动。因此，您的 EIC 金额于 2024 年 12 月被驳回。您在 2024 至 2033 纳税年度不能申报EIC。要在 2034 年报税表中申报 EIC, 您必须填写表格 8862 并将其附在您该年报税表中。\n如果您不同意 IRS 的最终决定，即您在一段时间内被禁止申报 EIC，并且想要对此决定提出上诉，请参阅 8862 表格的说明， _如何对禁止期提出上诉_ 。", "article_id": "p596", "doc_idx": 12}

If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n  * Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN).

Go to IRS.gov/DirectFile for more information, program updates, and frequently asked questions.\n  * **Free File.** This program lets you prepare and file your federal individual income tax return for free using software or Free File Fillable Forms. However, state tax preparation may not be available through Free File.

A paid tax preparer is:\n  * Primarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return, \n  * Required to sign the return, and\n  * Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n**Employers can register to use Business Services Online.**\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and individuals who process Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement; and Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.\n**Business tax account.**\nIf you are a sole proprietor, a partnership, or an S corporation, you can view your tax information on record with the IRS and do more with a business tax account.

This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.\n  * Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n  * Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN).

{"en": "#### Form Required\nUse IRS Form 2848 to appoint a recognized representative to act on your behalf before the IRS. Individuals recognized to represent you before the IRS are listed under _Part II, Declaration of Representative,_ of Form 2848. Your representative must complete that part of the form.\n**Non-IRS powers of attorney.**\nThe IRS will accept a non-IRS power of attorney, but a completed Form 2848 must be attached in order for the power of attorney to be entered on the Centralized Authorization File (CAF) system. For more information, see  _Processing a non-IRS power of attorney_ , later. \nIf you want to use a document other than Form 2848 to authorize the representation, it must contain the following information. \n  * Your name and mailing address.\n  * Your social security number (or your individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN)) and/or employer identification number.\n  * Your employee plan number, if applicable.\n  * The name and mailing address of your representative(s).\n  * The types of tax involved.\n  * The federal tax form number.\n  * The specific year(s) or period(s) involved.\n  * For estate tax matters, the decedent's date of death.\n  * A clear expression of your intention concerning the scope of authority granted to your representative(s).\n  * Your signature and date.\nYou also must attach to the non-IRS power of attorney a signed and dated statement made by your representative. This statement, which is referred to as the Declaration of Representative, is contained in Part II of Form 2848. The statement should read: \n  1. I am not currently under suspension or disbarment from practice before the Internal Revenue Service or other practice of my profession by any other authority,\n  2. I am subject to regulations contained in Circular 230 (31 C.F.R., Subtitle A, Part 10) as amended, governing practice before the Internal Revenue Service,\n  3. I am authorized to represent the taxpayer(s) identified in the power of attorney, and\n  4. I am a (naming the capacity in which representation is undertaken, as set forth in the list of eligible representatives at Part II of Form 2848.)\n_**Required information missing.**_\nThe IRS will not accept your non-IRS power of attorney if it does not contain all the information listed above. You can sign and submit a completed Form 2848 or a new non-IRS power of attorney that contains all the information. If you cannot sign an acceptable replacement document, your attorney-in-fact may be able to perfect (make acceptable to the IRS) your non-IRS power of attorney by using the procedure described next. \n_**Procedure for perfecting a non-IRS power of attorney.**_\nUnder the following conditions, the attorney-in-fact named in your non-IRS power of attorney can sign a Form 2848 on your behalf. \n  1. The original non-IRS power of attorney grants authority to handle federal tax matters (for example, general authority to perform any acts).\n  2. The attorney-in-fact attaches a statement (signed under penalty of perjury) to the Form 2848 stating that the original non-IRS power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction.\n**Example.**\nJohn Elm, a taxpayer, signs a non-IRS durable power of attorney that names his neighbor and CPA, Ed Larch, as his attorney-in-fact. The power of attorney grants Ed the authority to perform any and all acts on John's behalf. However, it does not list specific tax-related information such as types of tax or tax form numbers.\nShortly after John signs the power of attorney, he is declared incompetent. Later, a federal tax matter arises concerning a prior year return filed by John. Ed attempts to represent John before the IRS but is rejected because the durable power of attorney does not contain required information.\nIf Ed attaches a statement (signed under the penalty of perjury) that the durable power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction, he can sign a completed Form 2848 and submit it on John's behalf. If Ed can practice before the IRS (see  _Who Can Practice Before the IRS_ , earlier), he can name himself as representative on Form 2848. Otherwise, he must name another individual who can practice before the IRS.\n_**Processing a non-IRS power of attorney.**_\nThe IRS has a centralized computer database system called the CAF system. This system contains information on the authority of taxpayer representatives. Generally, when you submit a power of attorney document to the IRS, it is processed for inclusion on the CAF system. Entry of your power of attorney on the CAF system enables IRS personnel, who do not have a copy of your power of attorney, to verify the authority of your representative by accessing the CAF. It also enables the IRS to automatically send copies of notices and other IRS communications to your representative if you specify that your representative should receive those communications.\nYou can have your non-IRS power of attorney entered on the CAF system by attaching it to a completed Form 2848 and submitting it to the IRS. Your signature is not required; however, your attorney-in-fact must sign the _Declaration of Representative_(see Part II of Form 2848).
