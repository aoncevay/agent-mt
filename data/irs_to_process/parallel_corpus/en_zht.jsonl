{"en": "## 6. How To Figure Cost of Goods Sold\n#### Introduction\nIf you make or buy goods to sell, you can deduct the cost of goods sold from your gross receipts on Schedule C. However, to determine these costs, you must value your inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year.\nThis chapter applies to you if you are a manufacturer, wholesaler, or retailer or if you are engaged in any business that makes, buys, or sells goods to produce income. This chapter does not apply to a personal service business, such as the business of a doctor, lawyer, carpenter, or painter. However, if you work in a personal service business and also sell or charge for the materials and supplies normally used in your business, this chapter applies to you.\n#### Figuring Cost of Goods Sold on Schedule C, Lines 35 Through 42\nFigure your cost of goods sold by filling out lines 35 through 42 of Schedule C. These lines are reproduced below and are explained in the discussion that follows.\n**35** | Inventory at beginning of year. If different from last year's closing inventory, attach explanation | _____  \n---|---|---  \n**36** | Purchases less cost of items withdrawn for personal use | _____  \n**37** | Cost of labor. Do not include any amounts paid to yourself | _____  \n**38** | Materials and supplies | _____  \n**39** | Other costs |   \n**40** | Add lines 35 through 39 | _____  \n**41** | Inventory at end of year |   \n**42** | **Cost of goods sold.** Subtract line 41 from line 40. Enter the result here and on line 4 |   \n#### Line 35—Inventory at Beginning of Year\nIf you are a merchant, beginning inventory is the cost of merchandise on hand at the beginning of the year that you will sell to customers. If you are a manufacturer or producer, it includes the total cost of raw materials, work in process, finished goods, and materials and supplies used in manufacturing the goods (see _Inventories_ in chapter 2).\nOpening inventory will usually be identical to the closing inventory of the year before. You must explain any difference in a schedule attached to your return.\n**Donation of inventory.**\nIf you contribute inventory (property that you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can claim as a contribution deduction is the smaller of its fair market value on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of donated inventory is any cost incurred for the inventory in an earlier year that you would otherwise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your contribution deduction from your opening inventory. It is not part of the cost of goods sold.\nIf the cost of donated inventory is not included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you cannot claim a charitable contribution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the purchase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year.\nA special rule may apply to certain donations of food inventory. See Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.\n**Example 1.**\nYou are a calendar year taxpayer who uses an accrual method of accounting. In 2024, you contributed property from inventory to a church. It had a fair market value of $600. The closing inventory at the end of 2023 properly included $400 of costs due to the acquisition of the property, and in 2023, you properly deducted $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property as business expenses. The charitable contribution allowed for 2024 is $400 ($600 − $200). The $200 is the amount that would be ordinary income if you had sold the contributed inventory at fair market value on the date of the gift. The cost of goods sold you use in determining gross income for 2024 must not include the $400. You remove that amount from opening inventory for 2024.\n**Example 2.**\nIf, in _Example 1_ , you acquired the contributed property in 2024 at a cost of $400, you would include the $400 cost of the property in figuring the cost of goods sold for 2024 and deduct the $50 of administrative and other expenses attributable to the property for that year. You would not be allowed any charitable contribution deduction for the contributed property.\n#### Line 36—Purchases Less Cost of Items Withdrawn for Personal Use\nIf you are a merchant, use the cost of all merchandise you bought for sale. If you are a manufacturer or producer, this includes the cost of all raw materials or parts purchased for manufacture into a finished product.\n**Trade discounts.**\nThe differences between the stated prices of articles and the actual prices you pay for them are called trade discounts. You must use the prices you pay (not the stated prices) in figuring your cost of purchases. Do not show the discount amount separately as an item in gross income.\nAn automobile dealer must record the cost of a car in inventory reduced by any manufacturer's rebate that represents a trade discount. \n**Cash discounts.**\nCash discounts are amounts your suppliers let you deduct from your purchase invoices for prompt payments. There are two methods of accounting for cash discounts. You can either credit them to a separate discount account or deduct them from total purchases for the year. Whichever method you use, you must be consistent. If you want to change your method of figuring inventory cost, you must file Form 3115. For more information, see _Change in Accounting Method_ in chapter 2.\nIf you credit cash discounts to a separate account, you must include this credit balance in your business income at the end of the tax year. If you use this method, do not reduce your cost of goods sold by the cash discounts.\n**Purchase returns and allowances.**\nYou must deduct all returns and allowances from your total purchases during the year.\n**Merchandise withdrawn from sale.**\nIf you withdraw merchandise for your personal or family use, you must exclude this cost from the total amount of merchandise you bought for sale. Do this by crediting the purchases or sales account with the cost of merchandise you withdraw for personal use. You must also charge the amount to your drawing account. \nA drawing account is a separate account you should keep to record the business income you withdraw to pay for personal and family expenses. As stated above, you also use it to record withdrawals of merchandise for personal or family use. This account is also known as a withdrawals account or personal account. \n#### Line 37—Cost of Labor\nLabor costs are usually an element of cost of goods sold only in a manufacturing or mining business. Small merchandisers (wholesalers, retailers, etc.) usually do not have labor costs that can properly be charged to cost of goods sold. In a manufacturing business, labor costs properly allocable to the cost of goods sold include both the direct and indirect labor used in fabricating the raw material into a finished, saleable product.\n**Direct labor.**\nDirect labor costs are the wages you pay to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. They also include a part of the wages you pay to employees who work directly on the product part time if you can determine that part of their wages. \n**Indirect labor.**\nIndirect labor costs are the wages you pay to employees who perform a general factory function that does not have any immediate or direct connection with making the saleable product, but that is a necessary part of the manufacturing process.\n**Other labor.**\nOther labor costs not properly chargeable to the cost of goods sold can be deducted as selling or administrative expenses. Generally, the only kinds of labor costs properly chargeable to your cost of goods sold are the direct or indirect labor costs and certain other costs treated as overhead expenses properly charged to the manufacturing process, as discussed later under _Line 39—Other Costs_.\n#### Line 38—Materials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies, such as hardware and chemicals, used in manufacturing goods are charged to cost of goods sold. Those that are not used in the manufacturing process are treated as deferred charges. You deduct them as a business expense when you use them. Business expenses are discussed in chapter 8.\n#### Line 39—Other Costs\nExamples of other costs incurred in a manufacturing or mining process that you charge to your cost of goods sold are as follows.\n**Containers.**\nContainers and packages that are an integral part of the product manufactured are a part of your cost of goods sold. If they are not an integral part of the manufactured product, their costs are shipping or selling expenses. \n**Freight-in.**\nFreight-in, express-in, and cartage-in on raw materials, supplies you use in production, and merchandise you purchase for sale are all part of cost of goods sold. \n**Overhead expenses.**\nOverhead expenses include expenses such as rent, heat, light, power, insurance, depreciation, taxes, maintenance, labor, and supervision. The overhead expenses you have as direct and necessary expenses of the manufacturing operation are included in your cost of goods sold. \n#### Line 40—Add Lines 35 Through 39\nThe total of lines 35 through 39 equals the cost of the goods available for sale during the year.\n#### Line 41—Inventory at End of Year\nSubtract the value of your closing inventory (including, as appropriate, the allocable parts of the cost of raw materials and supplies, direct labor, and overhead expenses) from line 40. Inventory at the end of the year is also known as closing or ending inventory. Your ending inventory will usually become the beginning inventory of your next tax year.\n#### Line 42—Cost of Goods Sold\nWhen you subtract your closing inventory (inventory at the end of the year) from the cost of goods available for sale, the remainder is your cost of goods sold during the tax year.", "zht": "## 6. 如何計算銷貨成本\n#### 介紹\n如果您製造或購買商品以進行銷售，您可從附表 C 上的總收入中扣除銷貨成本。然而，為確定這些成本，在每個稅務年度初和末，您須估算庫存的價值。\n如果您是生產商、批發商，或從事任何生產、購買或出售商品的業務以產生收入，則本章適用於您。本章不適用於個人服務型業務，例如醫師、律師、木工或油漆工等業務。然而，如果您從事個人服務業務，且也出售通常在您的業務中使用的物料和供應品，或收取這些物料和供應品的費用，則本章適用於您。\n#### 計算銷貨成本—— 附表 C 第 35 行至第 42 行\n請填寫附表 C第 35 行至第 42 行，以計算您的銷貨成本。這幾行複製如下，並在 隨後的討論中予以解釋。\n**35** | 年初庫存。如果與去年的年末庫存不同，請附上解釋 | _____  \n---|---|---  \n**36** | 採購額減去支取以供個人使用的商品的成本 | _____  \n**37** | 人工成本。請不要包含向您自己支付的任何金額 | _____  \n**38** | 物料和供應品 | _____  \n**39** | 其他成本 |   \n**40** | 將第 35 行至第 39 行相加 | _____  \n**41** | 年末庫存 |   \n**42** | **銷貨成本。** 第 40 行減去第 41 行。 在此處和第 4 行輸入結果 |   \n#### 第 35 行, 年初庫存\n如果您是商家，期初庫存是您將出售給客戶的年初現有商品的成本。如果您是生產商或製造商，此項目包含原材料、在製品、成品和生產商品時使用的物料和供應品的總成本（請參閱第 2 章 _庫存_ ）。\n年初庫存通常與前一年的年末庫存相同。您須在報稅表隨附的附表中對任何差額作出解釋。\n**庫存捐贈。**\n如果您捐贈庫存（即您在業務過程中出售的財產），您可以申報的捐贈扣除額是您捐贈庫存之日其公平市值與庫存基數中的較小者。已捐贈的庫存的基數是在捐贈当年本應包含在您的年初庫存中、在較早年度因庫存而產生的任何成本。您須從您的年初庫存中扣除您的捐贈扣除額。這不是銷貨成本的一部分。\n如果已捐贈庫存的成本沒有包含在您的年初庫存中，則庫存的基數為零，所以您不能申報慈善捐贈扣除額。按照您通常採用的會計方法處理庫存成本。例如，將當年購買和捐贈的庫存的購買價格計入當年的銷貨成本中。\n特別規則可能適用於若干類食品庫存捐贈。請參閱 526 號刊物【慈善捐獻】。\n**範例 1。**\n您是採用日曆年度的納稅人，使用應計會計制。2024 年，您從庫存向教會捐獻了財產。該財產的公平市值是 600 美元。2023 年底的期末庫存適當地包含了因收購該財產而產生的 400 美元成本，且在 2023 年，作為營業費用，您適當地扣除了 50 美元因該財產而產生的行政和其他支出。2024 年允許的慈善捐獻額是 400 美元（600 美元 − 200 美元）。假如您在捐獻之日按公平市值出售捐獻的庫存，那麼 200 美元就是普通收入的金額。用於確定 2024 年總收入的銷貨成本不得包括 400 美元。您要在 2024 年的期初庫存中去除該金額。\n**範例 2。**\n如果在 _範例 1_ 中，您以 400 美元成本在 2024 年收購了捐獻的財產，您會在計算 2024 年的銷貨成本時包含該財產的 400 美元成本，並扣除該年度內該財產所產生的 50 美元行政和其他支出。您無法就捐贈的財產進行任何慈善捐贈扣除。\n#### 第 36 行, 採購額減去支取以供個人使用的商品的成本\n如果您是商家，請使用您為出售而購買的全部商品的成本。如果您是生產商或製造商，這包括為生產成品而購買的全部原材料或零件的成本。\n**貿易折扣。**\n商品的訂明價格和您支付這些商品的實際價格之間的差額，稱為貿易折扣。在計算採購成本時，您須使用您支付的價格（而非訂明的價格）。請不要在總收入中將折扣金額單獨顯示為一個項目。\n汽車經銷商須記錄庫存汽車的成本，並減去任何生產商作為貿易折扣的回扣。\n**現金折扣。**\n現金折扣是您的供應商讓您從採購發票中扣除的金額，以便及時付款。有兩種現金折扣會計方法。您可將現金折扣記入獨立折扣帳戶的貸方，或從年內的總採購額中扣除。無論您使用哪種方法，都要貫徹使用。如果您想變更計算庫存成本的方法，您須提交 3115 表。如需了解更多資訊，請參閱第 2 章 _變更會計方法_ 。\n如果您將現金折扣記入獨立帳戶的貸方，在稅務年度末，您須在營業收入中包含該貸方餘額。如果您使用這種方法，您不可透過現金折扣來降低您的銷貨成本。\n**採購額退款和津貼。**\n您須從年內的總採購額中扣除全部退款和津貼。\n**從銷售中支取的商品。**\n如果您支取商品以供個人或家庭使用，則必須從您購買用於銷售的商品總額中扣除該成本。請將您支取以供個人或家庭使用的商品的成本記入採購或銷售帳戶的貸方。您也須從您的提款帳戶中扣除該金額。 \n提款帳戶是您應保留的獨立帳戶，用以記錄您為支付個人和家庭支出而提取的營業收入。如上所述，您也使用提款帳戶記錄供個人或家庭使用而支取的商品。該帳戶也稱為支取帳戶或個人帳戶。\n#### 第 37 行, 人工成本\n人工成本通常是僅存在於製造業或採礦業的銷貨成本元素。小型貿易商（批發商、零售商等）通常沒有可適當地計入銷貨成本的人工成本。在製造業務中，可適當地分配至銷貨成本的人工成本，包括把原材料造成可出售的成品所用的直接和間接人工。\n**直接人工。**\n直接人工成本是您向用全部時間直接處理待生產的產品的員工支付的工資。這些成本也包括向直接處理產品的兼職員工支付的一部分工資（如果您能確定這部分工資）。\n**間接人工。**\n間接人工成本是您向履行一般工廠職能的員工支付的工資，而這些職能與生產可出售的產品沒有任何即時或直接的關聯，但卻是生產流程必不可少的一環。\n**其他人工。**\n不可適當地計入銷貨成本的其他人工成本可以作為銷售或行政支出予以扣除。一般來說，可適當計入銷貨成本的幾類人工成本，是直接或間接人工成本，以及被視為已適當從生產流程中扣除的管理費用的若干其他成本，正如下文 _第 39 行，其他成本_ 所討論一樣。\n#### 第 38 行, 物料和供應品\n用於生產商品的物料和供應品（例如硬體和化學品）計入銷貨成本內。並非用於生產商品的物料和供應品被視為遞延支出。您在使用這些物料和供應品時，要作為營業費用予以扣除。營業費用會在 第 8 章中加以討論。\n#### 第 39 行, 其他成本\n在製造或採礦流程中產生、計入銷貨成本的其他成本舉例如下。\n**容器。**\n作為生產的產品一部分的容器及包裝是銷貨成本的一部分。如果容器及包裝不是生產的產品一部分，那麼這些成本就是運輸或銷售支出。\n**進貨運費。**\n您在生產中使用的原材料、供應品和您為出售而購買的商品的進貨運費、進貨快遞費和進貨搬運費，全都是銷貨成本的一部分。\n**管理費用。**\n管理費用包括租金、熱能、照明、電力、保險、折舊、稅務、維護、人工和監管等支出。您產生的作為製造業務的直接必要支出的管理費用計入您的銷貨成本中。\n#### 第 40 行, 將第 35 行至第 39 行相加\n第 35 行至第 39 行的總計等於年內可供出售商品的成本。\n#### 第 41 行, 年末庫存\n第 40 行減去您的年末庫存的價值（在適當的情況下，包括原材料和供應品成本、直接人工成本和管理費用的可分配部分） 。年末庫存也稱為期末或最後庫存。您的最後庫存通常會成為下一個稅務年度的年初庫存。\n#### 第 42 行, 銷貨成本\n當您以可供出售商品的成本減去期末庫存（年末庫存）時，餘額即該稅務年度內的銷貨成本。", "article_id": "p334", "doc_idx": 0}
{"en": "## 7. Figuring Gross Profit\n#### Introduction\nAfter you have figured the gross receipts from your business (chapter 5) and the cost of goods sold (chapter 6), you are ready to figure your gross profit. You must determine gross profit before you can deduct any business expenses. These expenses are discussed in chapter 8.\n**Businesses that sell products.**\nFigure your gross profit by first figuring your net receipts. Figure net receipts (line 3) on Schedule C by subtracting any returns and allowances (line 2) from gross receipts (line 1). Returns and allowances include cash or credit refunds you make to customers, rebates, and other allowances off the actual sales price. \nNext, subtract the cost of goods sold (line 4) from net receipts (line 3). The result is the gross profit from your business. \n**Businesses that sell services.**\nYou do not have to figure the cost of goods sold if the sale of merchandise is not an income-producing factor for your business. Your gross profit is the same as your net receipts (gross receipts minus any refunds, rebates, or other allowances). Most professions and businesses that sell services rather than products can figure gross profit directly from net receipts in this way. \n**Illustration.**\nThis illustration of the gross profit section of the income statement of a retail business shows how gross profit is figured. \n**Income Statement Year Ended December 31, 2024 **\nGross receipts | $400,000  \n---|---  \nMinus: Returns and allowances | _14,940_  \nNet receipts | $385,060  \nMinus: Cost of goods sold | _288,140_  \n**Gross profit** | **$96,920**  \nThe cost of goods sold for this business is figured as follows. \nInventory at beginning of year | $37,845  \n---|---  \nPlus: Purchases | $285,900 |   \nMinus: Items withdrawn for personal use | _2,650_ | _283,250_  \nGoods available for sale | $321,095  \nMinus: Inventory at end of year | _32,955_  \n**Cost of goods sold** | **$288,140**  \n#### Items To Check\nConsider the following items before figuring your gross profit.\n**Gross receipts.**\nAt the end of each business day, make sure your records balance with your actual cash and credit receipts for the day. You may find it helpful to use cash registers to keep track of receipts. You should also use a proper invoicing system and keep a separate bank account for your business.\n**Sales tax collected.**\nCheck to make sure your records show the correct sales tax collected.\nIf you collect state and local sales taxes imposed on you as the seller of goods or services from the buyer, you must include the amount collected in gross receipts.\nIf you are required to collect state and local taxes imposed on the buyer and turn them over to state or local governments, you generally do not include these amounts in income.\n**Inventory at beginning of year.**\nCompare this figure with last year's ending inventory. The two amounts should usually be the same. \n**Purchases.**\nIf you take any inventory items for your personal use (use them yourself, provide them to your family, or give them as personal gifts, etc.), be sure to remove them from the cost of goods sold. For details on how to adjust cost of goods sold, see _Merchandise withdrawn from sale_ in chapter 6. \n**Inventory at end of year.**\nCheck to make sure your procedures for taking inventory are adequate. These procedures should ensure all items have been included in inventory and proper pricing techniques have been used.\nUse inventory forms and adding machine tapes as the only evidence for your inventory. Inventory forms are available at office supply stores. These forms have columns for recording the description, quantity, unit price, and value of each inventory item. Each page has space to record who made the physical count, who priced the items, who made the extensions, and who proofread the calculations. These forms will help you confirm that the total inventory is accurate. They will also provide you with a permanent record to support its validity. \nInventories are discussed in chapter 2.\n#### Testing Gross Profit Accuracy\nIf you are in a retail or wholesale business, you can check the accuracy of your gross profit figure. First, divide gross profit by net receipts. The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price.\nNext, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.\n_**Example.**_\nYou operate a retail business. On the average, you mark up your merchandise so that you will realize a gross profit of 331/3% on its sales. The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on your income statement are $300,000. Your cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 − $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, you divide gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000). The resulting 331/3% confirms your markup percentage of 331/3%.\n#### Additions to Gross Profit\nIf your business has income from a source other than its regular business operations, enter the income on line 6 of Schedule C and add it to gross profit. The result is gross business income. Some examples include income from an interest-bearing checking account, income from scrap sales, income from certain fuel tax credits and refunds, and amounts recovered from bad debts.\n#### Introduction\nThis publication provides general information about the federal tax laws that apply to you if you are a self-employed person or a statutory employee.

You are insured if you have the required number of credits (also called quarters of coverage), discussed next. \n_**Earning credits in 2024 and 2025.**_\nFor 2024, you received one credit, up to a maximum of four credits, for each $1,730 ($1,810 for 2025) of income subject to social security tax. Therefore, for 2024, if you had income (self-employment and wages) of $6,920 that was subject to social security tax, you received four credits ($6,920 ÷ $1,730). \nFor an explanation of the number of credits you must have to be insured and the benefits available to you and your family under the social security program, consult your nearest SSA office.\n**The SSA time limit for posting self-employment income.**\nGenerally, the SSA will give you credit only for self-employment income reported on a tax return filed within 3 years, 3 months, and 15 days after the tax year you earned the income. If you file your tax return or report a change in your self-employment income after this time limit, the SSA may change its record but only to remove or reduce the amount. The SSA will not change its records to increase your self-employment income. \n**Who must pay SE tax.**\nYou must pay SE tax and file Schedule SE (Form 1040) if either of the following applies. \n  1. Your net earnings from self-employment (excluding church employee income) were $400 or more.\n  2. You had church employee income of $108.28 or more. \n**SE tax rate.**\nThe SE tax rate on net earnings is 15.3% (12.4% social security tax plus 2.9% Medicare tax). \n**Maximum earnings subject to SE tax.**\nOnly the first $168,600 of your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 is subject to any combination of the 12.4% social security part of SE tax, social security tax, or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax. \nAll your combined wages, tips, and net earnings in 2024 are subject to any combination of the 2.9% Medicare part of SE tax, Medicare tax, or Medicare part of railroad retirement tax.\nIf wages and tips you receive as an employee are subject to either social security tax or the Tier 1 part of railroad retirement tax, or both, and total at least $168,600, do not pay the 12.4% social security part of the SE tax on any of your net earnings. However, you must pay the 2.9% Medicare part of the SE tax on all your net earnings.\n**Additional Medicare Tax.**\nA 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax may apply to you if your net earnings from self-employment exceed one of the following threshold amounts (based on your filing status).\n  * Married filing jointly—$250,000\n  * Married filing separately—$125,000\n  * Single, Head of household, or Qualifying surviving spouse—$200,000\nIf you have both wages and self-employment income, the threshold amount for applying the Additional Medicare Tax on the self-employment income is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. Use Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax, to figure this tax.\n**More information.**\nFor information on methods of calculating SE tax, see chapter 10 Tax\").\n##### Table 1-2.

{"en": "#### Rule 9—Your Qualifying Child Cannot Be Used by More Than One Person To Claim the EIC\nSometimes a child meets the tests to be a qualifying child of more than one person. However, only one of these persons can actually treat the child as a qualifying child. Only that person can use the child as a qualifying child to take all of the following tax benefits (provided the person is eligible for each benefit).\n  1. The child tax credit, credit for other dependents, or additional child tax credit.\n  2. Head of household filing status. \n  3. The credit for child and dependent care expenses.\n  4. The exclusion for dependent care benefits.\n  5. The EIC.\nThe other person can’t take any of these benefits based on this qualifying child. In other words, you and the other person can’t agree to divide these tax benefits between you. The other person can’t take any of these tax benefits unless that person has a different qualifying child. \nThe tiebreaker rules, which follow, explain who, if anyone, can claim the EIC when more than one person has the same qualifying child. However, the tiebreaker rules don't apply if the other person is your spouse and you file a joint return.\n**Tiebreaker rules.**\nTo determine which person can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the five tax benefits just listed, the following tiebreaker rules apply. For purposes of these tiebreaker rules, the term “parent” means a biological or adoptive parent of an individual. It does not include a stepparent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individual.\n  * If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parent.\n  * If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the parents.\n  * If the parents don't file a joint return together but both parents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child lived for the longer period of time during the year. If the child lived with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the higher AGI for the year.\n  * If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year.\n  * If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no parent claims the child, the child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the highest AGI for the year, but only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of the child's parents who can claim the child.\nSubject to these tiebreaker rules, you and the other person may be able to choose which of you claims the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 1 through 12.\nIf you can’t claim the EIC because your qualifying child is treated under the tiebreaker rules as the qualifying child of another person for 2024, you may be able to take the EIC using a different qualifying child, or take the EIC using the rules in chapter 3 for people who don't have a qualifying child.\n**If the other person cannot claim the EIC.**\nIf you and someone else have the same qualifying child but the other person can’t claim the EIC because the other person isn't eligible or their earned income or AGI is too high, you may be able to treat the child as a qualifying child. See Examples 6 and 7. But you can’t treat the child as a qualifying child to claim the EIC if the other person uses the child to claim any of the other five tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter.\n**Examples.**\nThe following examples may help you in determining whether you can claim the EIC when you and someone else have the same qualifying child.\n**Example 1—Child lived with parent and grandparent.**\nYou and your 2-year-old child Sam lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. Your only income was $9,000 from a part-time job. Your parent's only income was $22,000 from a job, and their AGI is $22,000. Your child’s other parent did not live with you or Sam. The special rule explained later for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) doesn't apply. Sam is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Sam meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only one of you can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and the other tax benefits listed earlier in this chapter for which that person qualifies). Sam isn't a qualifying child of anyone else, including the child’s other parent. If you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC (and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which your parent qualifies).\n**Example 2—Parent has higher AGI than grandparent.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your AGI is $25,000. Because your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your parent can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only you can claim Sam.\n**Example 3—Two persons claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you and your parent both claim Sam as a qualifying child. In this case, you as the child's parent will be the only one allowed to claim Sam as a qualifying child for the EIC and the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify. The IRS will disallow your parent's claim to the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier based on Sam. Your parent can't take the EIC for a taxpayer without a qualifying child because your parent’s AGI is more than $18,591.\n**Example 4—Qualifying children split between two persons.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you also have two other young children who are qualifying children of both you and your parent. Only one of you can claim each child. However, if your parent's AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your parent to claim one or more of the children. For example, if you claim one child, your parent can claim the other two.\n**Example 5—Taxpayer who is a qualifying child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you are only 18 years old. This means you are a qualifying child of your parent. Because of _Rule 10_ , discussed next, you can’t claim the EIC and can’t claim Sam as a qualifying child. Only your parent may be able to treat Sam as a qualifying child to claim the EIC. If your parent meets all the other requirements for claiming the EIC and you don't claim Sam as a qualifying child for any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, your parent can claim both you and Sam as qualifying children for the EIC.\n**Example 6—Grandparent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that your parent earned $50,000 from employment. Because your parent's earned income is too high for your parent to claim the EIC, only you can claim the EIC using Sam.\n**Example 7—Parent with too much earned income to claim EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except that you earned $50,000 from your job and your AGI is $50,500. Your earned income is too high for you to claim the EIC. But your parent can’t claim the EIC either, because your parent’s AGI isn't higher than yours.\n**Example 8—Separated parents.**\nYou, your spouse, and your 10-year-old child, Jordan, lived together until August 1, 2024, when your spouse moved out of the household. In August and September, Jordan lived with you. For the rest of the year, Jordan lived with Jordan's other parent. Jordan is a qualifying child of both you and your spouse because Jordan lived with each of you for more than half the year and because Jordan met the relationship, age, and joint return tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written separation agreement, so the _Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_.\") doesn't apply. \nYou and your spouse will file separate returns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This means, if your spouse doesn't claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any of the tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Jordan as a qualifying child for any tax benefit listed earlier for which you qualify. However, you can't take the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 and, while you did live apart at the end of 2024, you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet the requirements for certain separated spouses to take the EIC when they don’t file a joint return. See Rule 3. You also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.\n**Example 9—Separated parents claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 8_ , except that you and your spouse both claim Jordan as a qualifying child. In this case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat Jordan as a qualifying child. This is because, during 2024, Jordan lived with your spouse longer than with you. You can’t claim the EIC because you are a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return and you don’t have a qualifying child. However, your spouse's filing status is also married filing separately, so your spouse can’t claim the EIC because you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024 or you aren't legally separated under a written separation agreement or decree of separate maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn't meet the requirements to claim the EIC as a separated spouse who isn’t filing a joint return. See Rule 3. Your spouse also can't take the credit for child and dependent care expenses because your spouse’s filing status is married filing separately and you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2024. See Pub. 503.\n**Example 10—Unmarried parents.**\nYou, your 5-year-old child, Logan, and Logan’s other parent lived together all year. You and Logan’s other parent aren't married. Logan is a qualifying child of both you and Logan’s other parent because Logan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and Logan’s other parent. Your earned income and AGI are $12,000, and Logan’s other parent’s earned income and AGI are $14,000. Neither of you had any other income. Logan’s other parent agrees to let you treat the child as a qualifying child. This means if Logan’s other parent doesn't claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC or any of the other tax benefits listed earlier, you can claim Logan as a qualifying child for the EIC and any of the other tax benefits listed earlier for which you qualify.\n**Example 11—Unmarried parents claim same child.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 10_ except that you and Logan’s other parent both claim Logan as a qualifying child. In this case, only Logan’s other parent will be allowed to treat Logan as a qualifying child. This is because Logan’s other parent’s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, $12,000. You can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.\n**Example 12—Child did not live with a parent.**\nYou and your sibling’s child, Morgan, lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and your AGI is $9,300. Your only income was from a part-time job. Your parent’s AGI is $15,000. Your parent’s only income was from a job. Morgan’s parents file jointly, have an AGI of less than $9,000, and don't live with you or Morgan. Morgan is a qualifying child of both you and your parent because Morgan meets the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests for both you and your parent. However, only your parent can treat Morgan as a qualifying child. This is because your parent’s AGI, $15,000, is more than your AGI, $9,300.\n**Special rule for divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart).**\nA child will be treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent if all of the following statements are true.\n  1. The parents:\n    1. Are divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance;\n    2. Are separated under a written separation agreement; or\n    3. Lived apart at all times during the last 6 months of 2024.\n  2. The child received over half of the child’s support for the year from the parents.\n  3. The child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of 2024.\n  4. Either of the following statements is true.\n    1. The custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substantially similar statement that the custodial parent will not claim the child as a dependent for the year, and the noncustodial parent attaches the form or statement to their return. If the divorce decree or separation agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial parent may be able to attach certain pages from the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. \n    2. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or written separation agreement that applies to 2024 provides that the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the child during 2024.\nFor details, see Pub. 501. If a child is treated as the qualifying child of the noncustodial parent under this special rule for children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), only the noncustodial parent can claim the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents for the child. However, only the custodial parent, if eligible, or another eligible taxpayer can claim the child as a qualifying child for the EIC. For details and examples, see _Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart)_ in Pub. 501.", "zht": "#### 規則 9—您的合資格子女不能被多人用於申報 EIC\n有時，一個子女通過了成為多人的合資格子女的測試。然而，這些人當中只有一個人可以真正將子女視為合資格的子女。只有該人可以將子女作為合資格的子女來享有以下所有稅收優惠（前提是該人有資格獲得每項福利）。\n  1. 子女稅優惠、其他被撫養人的優惠或額外的子女稅收優惠。\n  2. 戶長報稅身份。\n  3. 適用於子女和被撫養人的照護費用抵免。\n  4. 被撫養人照護福利的排除。\n  5. EIC 。\n其他人不能基於這個合資格的子女獲得任何這些福利。換句話說，您和其他人不能約定在您們之間分配這些稅收優惠。其他人不能享受任何這些稅收優惠， 除非該人有不同的合資格的子女。 \n下文的決勝局法則解釋了當不止一個人擁有相同的合資格的子女時，誰可以申報 EIC 。然而，如果其他人是您的配偶並且您們提交聯合報稅表，則決勝局法則不適用。\n**決勝局法則。**\n確定哪個人可以憑藉該子女的合條件子女身份來申請以上列出的五項稅收福利時，適用以下決勝局法則。出於這些決勝局法則的目的，「parent」(父母) 一詞是指個人的親生父母或收養父母。這不包括繼父母或養父母，除非該人收養了該子女。\n  * 如果其中只有一人是該名子女的父母，則該子女被視為其父母的合資格的子女。\n  * 如果父母一起提交聯合報稅表並且可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，則該子女將被視為其父母雙方的合資格子女。\n  * 如果父母雙方沒有一起提交聯合報稅表，但父母雙方都將該子女申報為合資格的子女，國稅局會將該子女視為相關年度與該 子女同住時間較長的父母一方的合資格子女。如果子女與父母雙方居住的時間相同，國稅局會將子女視為相關年度調整後總收入 (AGI) 較高的父母一方的合資格子女。\n  * 如果沒有父母可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，則該子女被視為相關年度 AGI 最高之人的合資格子女。\n  * 如果父母可以將子女申報為合資格的子女，但沒有父母這樣做，則該子女被視為相關年度AGI 最高之人的合資格子女，但前提是該人的 AGI 高於可以將該子女申報為合資格子女的任何父母的最高 AGI。\n根據這些決勝局法則，您和其他人可以選擇您們當中誰來將該名子女申報為合資格的子女。請參閱範例 1 至 範例 12。\n如果您無法申報 EIC 是因為您的合資格子女在 2024 年依照決勝局法則被視為其他人的合資格子女，您可以憑藉不同的合資格子女申報 EIC ，或使用第 3 章中適用於沒有合資格子女的納稅人的規則。\n**如果其他人無法申報 EIC 。**\n如果您和其他人有同一個合資格的子女，但其他人因為不符合條件或其收入或 調整後總收入太高而無法申報 EIC ，您可以將子女視為合資格的子女。請參閱 範例 6  和 範例 7。然而，如果其他人憑藉子女來申報本章前面列出的其他五項稅收優惠中的任何一項，則您無法將子女視為合資格的子女來申報 EIC 。\n**範例。**\n以下範例可以幫助您判定當您和其他人有相同的合資格的子女時，您是否可以申報 EIC 。\n**範例 1 - 子女與父母和祖父母同住。**\n您和您 2 歲的子女 Sam 全年都與您父母同住。您 25 歲，未婚，您的 AGI 為 9,000 美元。您的唯一收入是兼職工作獲得的 9,000 美元。您父母的唯一收入是工作獲得的 22,000 美元，而其 AGI 是 22,000 美元。您子女的另一方父母未與您和 Sam 同住。下文介紹的適用於離異或分居父母的特殊規定不適用。 Sam 是您和您父母的合資格子女，因為 Sam 通過了針對您和您父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。但是，您和您父母只有一方可以憑藉其合資格子女身份來申報 EIC（以及本章上文列出的該人有資格享受的其他稅收福利）。 Sam 不屬於任何其他人的合條件子女，包括其另一方父母。如果您未為了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以憑藉其合資格子女身份來申報 EIC（以及上文列出的您父母有資格享受的任何其他稅收福利）。 \n**範例 2—父母的調整後總收入高於祖父母。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您的 AGI 是 25,000 美元。因為您父母的 AGI 並不比您高，所以您父母不能將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。只有您可以將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。 \n**範例 3—兩個人申報同一個子女。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和您父母同時將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，您作為 Sam 的父母將是唯一被允許為了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有資格享受的其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女的人。 IRS 將不允許您父母憑藉 Sam 來申報 EIC 以及上文列出的任何其他稅收福利。您父母不能享受無任何合資格子女的納稅人可享受的 EIC，因為您父母的 AGI 超過了 18,591 美元。 \n**範例 4—合資格的子女分配給兩個人。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您還有另外兩個年幼的子女，他們都是您和您父母的合資格子女。每個子女僅供您和您父母中的一人申報為合資格子女。但是，如果您父母的 AGI 比您高，您可以讓您父母將一個或多個子女申報為合資格子女。例如，如果您將一個子女申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以將您另外兩個子女申報為合資格子女。 \n**範例 5—納稅人是合資格的子女。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您只有 18 歲。這意味著您是您父母的合資格子女。根據接下來要討論的 _規則 10_ ，您不能申報 EIC，也不能將 Sam 申報為合資格子女。只有您父母可以憑藉 Sam 的合資格子女身份來申報 EIC。如果您父母符合申報 EIC 的所有其他要求，而您未為了享受上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Sam 申報為合資格子女，則您父母可以為了享受 EIC 而將您和 Sam 同時申報為合資格子女。 \n**範例 6—祖父母的勞動所得過多而無法申報 EIC 。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您父母的工作收入是 50,000 美元。您父母因勞動所得太高而不能申報 EIC，因此只有您可以憑藉 Sam 申報 EIC。 \n**範例 7—父母的勞動所得過多而無法申報 EIC 。**\n事實與 _示例 1_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您的工作收入是 50,000 美元，您的 AGI 是 50,500 美元。您因勞動所得太高而不能申報 EIC。但是您父母也不能申報 EIC，因為您父母的 AGI 並不比您高。 \n**範例 8—分居的父母。**\n您、您配偶和您 10 歲的子女 Jordan 一直同住，直到 2024 年 8 月 1 日您配偶搬出去。 8 月和 9 月，Jordan 和您同住。在這一年剩下的時間裡，Jordan 和您配偶（Jordan 的另一方父母）同住。 Jordan 同時是您和您配偶的合資格子女，因為 Jordan 和您們兩人都同住了半年以上的時間，而且 Jordan 通過了針對您們倆的關係、年齡和聯合報稅表測試。到年底時，您和您配偶仍未離異、合法分居或根據書面分居協議進行分居，因此 _離婚或分居的父母（或分開生活的父母）的特殊規定_ 不適用。 \n您和您配偶將分別提交單獨報稅表。您配偶同意讓您將 Jordan 視為合資格子女。這意味著，如果您配偶未為了享受上文列出的任何稅收福利而將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女，則您可以為了享受上文列出的您有資格享受的任何稅收福利而將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女。但是，您不能獲取 EIC，因為您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分居，而且，雖然您們在 2024 年底確實分居，但您們並沒有根據書面分居協議或單獨撫養令合法分居。因此，您不符合某些分居配偶在不提交聯合報稅表的情況下享受 EIC 的要求。請參閱規則 3。您也不能享受子女和被撫養人護理費用抵免，因為您的申報身份是已婚分別申報，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住。請參閱 503 號刊物。 \n**範例 9—分居父母申報同一個子女。**\n事實與 _示例 8_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和您配偶同時將 Jordan 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，只有您配偶可以將 Jordan 視為合資格子女。這是因為，Jordan 在 2024 年與您配偶同住的時間比與您同住的時間長。您不能申報 EIC，因為您是沒有聯合報稅的分居配偶，而且您沒有一個合資格的子女。但是，您配偶的申報身份也是已婚分別申報，所以您配偶不能申報 EIC，因為您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住，或者您們沒有根據書面分居協議或分開撫養的法令合法分居。因此，您配偶作為沒有提交聯合報稅表的分居配偶，不符合申報 EIC 的要求。請參閱規則 3。您配偶也不能享受子女和被撫養人護理費用抵免，因為您配偶的申報身份是已婚分別申報，而且您和您配偶在 2024 年的最後 6 個月沒有分開居住。請參閱 503 號刊物。 \n**範例 10—未婚父母。**\n您、您 5 歲的子女 Logan 以及您子女的另一方父母全年同住。您和 Logan 的另一方父母未婚。 Logan 是您和 Logan 的另一方父母的合資格子女，因為 Logan 通過了針對您和 Logan 另一方父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。您的勞動所得和 AGI 均為 12,000 美元，Logan 的另一方父母的勞動所得和 AGI 均為 14,000 美元。您們都沒有任何其他收入。 Logan 的另一方父母同意讓您將 Logan 視為合資格子女。這意味著，如果 Logan 的另一方父母沒有為了享受 EIC 或上文列出的任何其他稅收福利而將 Logan 申報為合資格子女，則您可以為了享受 EIC 以及上文列出的您有資格享受的任何其他稅收福利而將 Logan 申報為合資格子女。 \n**範例 11—未婚父母申報同一個子女。**\n事實與 _示例 10_ 所述事實相同，不同的是您和 Logan 的另一方父母同時將 Logan 申報為合資格子女。在這種情況下，只有 Logan 的另一方父母可以將 Logan 視為合資格子女。這是因為其 AGI（14,000 美元）比您的 AGI（12,000 美元）高。您可以申請無任何合資格子女時可申請的 EIC。 \n**範例 12—子女沒有和父母同住。**\n您和您兄弟姐妹的子女 Morgan 全年都與您父母同住。您今年 25 歲，您的 AGI 為 9,300 美元。您唯一的收入來自兼職工作。您父母的 AGI 是 15,000 美元。您父母唯一的收入來自工作。 Morgan 的父母聯合報稅，他們的 AGI 低於 9,000 美元，並且他們不與您和 Morgan 同住。 Morgan 同時是您和您父母的合資格子女，因為 Morgan 通過了針對您和您父母的關係、年齡、居住地和聯合報稅表測試。但是，只有您父母可以將 Morgan 視為合資格子女。這是因為您父母的 AGI（15,000 美元）比您的 AGI（9,300 美元）高。 \n**離婚或分居父母（或分開生活的父母）的特殊規定。**\n如果以下所有聲明均屬實，則子女將被視為其非監護父母的合資格子女。\n  1. 父母：\n    1. 根據離婚法令或分居贍養令離婚或合法分居;\n    2. 根據書面分居協議分居; 或\n    3. 在 2024 年的最後 6 個月內一直處於分居狀態。\n  2. 子女在這一年裡從父母那裡得到了一半以上的支援。\n  3. 子女在 2024 年的一半以上時間由父母一方或雙方監護。\n  4. 以下任一聲明屬實。\n    1. 監護父母簽署《表格 8332》或實質上類似的聲明，表明不會將子女申請為該年度的被撫養人，並且非監護父母將表格或聲明附於其申報表中。如果離婚法令或分居協議在 1984 年之後和 2009 年之前生效，非監護父母可以附上法令或協議中的某些頁面，而非《表格 8332》。\n    2. 適用於 2024 年的 1985 年之前的離婚法令或單獨贍養費或書面分居協議，非監護父母可以將子女視為被撫養人，並且非監護父母在 2024 年期間至少提供 600 美元用於撫養子女。\n如需了解詳情，請參閱 501 號刊物。如果子女根據離婚或分居父母（或分居的父母）的子女特殊規則被視為非監護父母的合資格的子女，則只有非監護父母可以申請子女稅收抵免或其他被撫養人的抵免。然而，只有監護父母（如符合條件）或其他符合條件的納稅人才能將子女申請為 EIC 的合資格的子女。有關詳細資訊和範例，請參閱501 號刊物中 _應用於離婚或分居父母（或分居的父母）的決勝局法則_ 。", "article_id": "p596", "doc_idx": 8}
{"en": "## 3. Rules if You Do Not Have a Qualifying Child\nUse this chapter if you don't have a qualifying child and have met all the rules in chapter 1. This chapter discusses _Rules 11_ through _14_. You must meet all four of these rules, in addition to the rules in chapters 1 and 4, to qualify for the EIC without a qualifying child. If you meet all the rules in chapter 1 and this chapter, read chapter 4 to find out what to do next.\n**If you have a qualifying child.**\nIf you meet _Rule 8_ , you have a qualifying child. If you meet _Rule 8_ and don't claim the EIC with a qualifying child, you can claim the EIC without a qualifying child.\n#### Rule 11—You Must Meet the Age Requirements\nYou must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. If you are married filing a joint return, either you or your spouse must be at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024. It doesn't matter which spouse meets the age test, as long as one of the spouses does.\nYou meet the age test if you were born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000. If you are married filing a joint return, you meet the age test if either you or your spouse was born after December 31, 1959, and before January 2, 2000.\nIf neither you nor your spouse meets the age test, you can't claim the EIC. Enter \"No\" on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**Example 1.**\nYou are age 28 and unmarried. You meet the age test.\n**Example 2—Spouse meets age test.**\nYou are married and filing a joint return. You are age 23 and your spouse is age 27. You meet the age test because your spouse is at least age 25 but under age 65.\n**Death of spouse.**\nIf you are filing a joint return with your spouse who died in 2024, you meet the age test if you are at least age 25 but under age 65 at the end of 2024, or your spouse was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.\nYour spouse is considered to reach age 25 on the day before their 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; your spouse reaches age 65 on their 65th birthday.\nEven if your spouse was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.\n_**Example 1.**_\nYou are married and filing a joint return with your spouse who died in August 2024. You are age 67. Your spouse would have become age 65 in November 2024. Because your spouse was under age 65 at the time of death, you meet the age test.\n**Example 2.**\nYour spouse was born on February 14, 1999, and died on February 13, 2024. Your spouse is considered age 25 at the time of death. However, if your spouse died on February 12, 2024, your spouse isn't considered age 25 at the time of death and isn't at least age 25 at the end of 2024.\n**Death of taxpayer.**\nA taxpayer who died in 2024 meets the age test if the taxpayer was at least age 25 but under age 65 at the time of death.\nA taxpayer is considered to reach age 25 on the day before the taxpayer’s 25th birthday. However, the rule for reaching age 65 is different; a taxpayer reaches age 65 on the taxpayer’s 65th birthday.\nEven if the taxpayer was born before January 2, 2000, they aren't considered at least age 25 at the end of 2024 unless they were at least age 25 at the time of death.\n#### Rule 12—You Cannot Be the Dependent of Another Person\nIf you **aren't** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check the box under your name that says \"Someone can claim you as a dependent.\"\nIf you **are** filing a joint return, you meet this rule if you did **not** check either box that says \"Someone can claim you as a dependent\" or \"Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent.\"\nIf you aren't sure whether someone else can claim you as a dependent, get Pub. 501 and read the rules for claiming a dependent.\nIf someone else can claim you as a dependent on their return, but doesn't, you still can’t claim the credit unless the person who can claim you on their tax return isn't required to file an income tax return and doesn't file a tax return or files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.\n**Example 1.**\nIn 2024, you were age 25, single, and living at home with your parents. You worked and weren't a student. You earned $7,500. Your parents can’t claim you as a dependent. When you file your return, you do not check the \"Someone can claim you as a dependent\" checkbox. You meet this rule. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements.\n**Example 2.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ , except that you earned $2,000. Your parents can claim you as a dependent but decide not to. You don't meet this rule. You can’t claim the credit because your parents could have claimed you as a dependent.\n**Joint returns.**\nYou generally can’t be claimed as a dependent by another person if you are married and file a joint return.\nHowever, another person may be able to claim you as a dependent if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be claimed as a dependent by another person if you claim the EIC on your joint return.\n**Example 1—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**\nYou are 26 years old. You and your spouse live with your parents and had $800 of wages from part-time jobs and no other income. Neither you nor your spouse is required to file a tax return. You don't have a child. Taxes were taken out of your pay so you file a joint return only to get a refund of the withheld taxes. Your parents aren't disqualified from claiming you as a dependent just because you filed a joint return.\n**Example 2—Return filed to get EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except no taxes were taken out of your pay. Also, you and your spouse aren't required to file a tax return, but you file a joint return to claim an EIC of $63 and get a refund of that amount. Because claiming the EIC is your reason for filing the return, you aren't filing it only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. Your parents can’t claim you or your spouse as a dependent.\n#### Rule 13—You Cannot Be a Qualifying Child of Another Taxpayer\nYou are a qualifying child of another taxpayer (your parent, guardian, foster parent, etc.) if all of the following statements are true.\n  1. You are that person's son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them. Or, you are that person's brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them. \n  2. You were:\n    1. Under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly);\n    2. Under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than that person (or that person's spouse if the person files jointly); or\n    3. Permanently and totally disabled, regardless of age.\n  3. You lived with that person in the United States for more than half of the year.\n  4. You aren't filing a joint return for the year (or are filing a joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).\nFor more details about the tests to be a qualifying child, see Rule 8. \nIf you are a qualifying child of another taxpayer, you can’t claim the EIC. This is true even if the person for whom you are a qualifying child doesn't claim the EIC or meet all of the rules to claim the EIC. Enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**Example.**\nYou lived with your parent all year. You are age 26, unmarried, and permanently and totally disabled. Your only income was from a community center where you went 3 days a week to answer telephones. You earned $5,000 for the year and provided more than half of your own support. Because you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests, you are a qualifying child of your parent for the EIC. Your parent can claim the EIC if your parent meets all the other requirements. Because you are a qualifying child of your parent, you can’t claim the EIC. This is so even if your parent can’t or doesn’t claim the EIC.\n**Joint returns.**\nYou generally can’t be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you are married and file a joint return.\nHowever, you may be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you and your spouse file a joint return merely to claim a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid. But neither you nor your spouse can be a qualifying child of another taxpayer if you claim the EIC on your joint return.\n**Child of person not required to file a return.**\nYou aren't the qualifying child of another taxpayer (and so may qualify to claim the EIC) if the person for whom you meet the relationship, age, residency, and joint return tests isn't required to file an income tax return and either:\n  * Doesn't file an income tax return, or\n  * Files a return only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid.\n**Example 1—Return not required.**\nYou lived all year with your parent. You are 27 years old, unmarried, permanently and totally disabled, and earned $13,000. You have no other income, no children, and provided more than half of your own support. Your parent had no gross income, isn't required to file a 2024 tax return, and doesn't file a 2024 tax return. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.\n**Example 2—Return filed to get refund of tax withheld.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 1_ except your parent had wages of $1,500 and had income tax withheld from wages. Your parent files a return only to get a refund of the income tax withheld and doesn't claim the EIC or any other tax credits or deductions. As a result, you aren't your parent's qualifying child. You can claim the EIC if you meet all the other requirements to do so.\n**Example 3—Return filed to get EIC.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 2_ except your parent claimed the EIC on their return. Since your parent filed the return to get the EIC, your parent isn't filing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld. As a result, you are your parent’s qualifying child. You can’t claim the EIC.\n#### Rule 14—You Must Have Lived in the United States More Than Half of the Year\nYour home (and your spouse's if filing a joint return) must have been in the United States for more than half the year. \nIf it wasn't, enter “No” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).\n**United States.**\nThis means the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

{"en": "## 4. Figuring and Claiming the EIC\nYou must meet one more rule to claim the EIC.\nYou need to know the amount of your earned income to see if you meet the rule in this chapter. You also need to know that amount to figure your EIC.\n#### Rule 15—Earned Income Limits\nYour earned income must be less than:\n  * $59,899 ($66,819 for married filing jointly) if you have three or more qualifying children who have valid SSNs,\n  * $55,768 ($62,688 for married filing jointly) if you have two qualifying children who have valid SSNs,\n  * $49,084 ($56,004 for married filing jointly) if you have one qualifying child who has a valid SSN, or\n  * $18,591 ($25,511 for married filing jointly) if you don't have a qualifying child who has a valid SSN.\n#### Earned Income\nEarned income generally means wages, salaries, tips, other taxable employee pay, and net earnings from self-employment. Employee pay is earned income only if it is taxable. Nontaxable employee pay, such as certain dependent care benefits and adoption benefits, isn't earned income. But there is an exception for nontaxable combat pay, which you can choose to include in earned income. Earned income is explained in detail in _Rule 7_ in chapter 1. \n**Figuring earned income.**\nIf you are self-employed, a statutory employee, or a member of the clergy or a church employee who files Schedule SE (Form 1040), you will figure your earned income by using the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27 and then filling out Part 4 of EIC Worksheet B in the Form 1040 instructions. Be sure to see _Clergy_ or _Church employees_, whichever applies, before completing the worksheet in _Step 5_. \n_**Clergy.**_\nIf you are a member of the clergy who files Schedule SE and the amount on line 2 of that schedule includes an amount that was also reported on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, subtract that amount from the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1z, and enter the result on line 1 of the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27. Enter “Clergy” on the dotted line next to line 27 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR). \n_**Church employees.**_\nA church employee means an employee (other than a minister or member of a religious order) of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that is exempt from employer social security and Medicare taxes. If you received wages as a church employee and included any amount on both line 5a of Schedule SE and Form 1040, line 1a, subtract that amount from the amount on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1a, and enter the result on line 1 of the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions for line 27. \n_**Medicaid waiver payments.**_\nWhen completing the worksheet in _Step 5_ of the Form 1040 instructions, line 27, enter the Medicaid waiver payments you excluded from income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8s, unless you choose to include these amounts in earned income, in which case enter -0-. For more information about these payments, see Pub. 525.\n_**Nontaxable combat pay.**_\nYou can elect to include your nontaxable combat pay in earned income for the EIC. If you make the election, you must include in earned income all nontaxable combat pay you received.\nIf you are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received nontaxable combat pay, you can each make your own election. In other words, if one of you makes the election, the other one can also make it but doesn't have to.\nThe amount of your nontaxable combat pay should be shown on your Form W-2 in box 12 with code Q.\nElecting to include nontaxable combat pay in earned income may increase or decrease your EIC. Figure the credit with and without your nontaxable combat pay before making the election. Whether the election increases or decreases your EIC depends on your total earned income, filing status, and number of qualifying children. If your earned income without your combat pay is less than the amount shown below for your number of children, you may benefit from electing to include your nontaxable combat pay in earned income and you should figure the credit both ways. If your earned income without your combat pay is equal to or more than these amounts, you will not benefit from including your combat pay in your earned income.\n  * $8,260 if you have no children who have valid SSNs.\n  * $12,390 if you have one child who has a valid SSN.\n  * $17,400 if you have two or more children who have valid SSNs.\n#### IRS Will Figure the EIC for You\nThe IRS will figure your EIC for you if you follow the instructions for Line 27 in the Instructions for Form 1040.\n#### How To Figure the EIC Yourself\nTo figure the EIC yourself, use the EIC Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040. If you have a qualifying child, complete Schedule EIC (discussed later in this chapter) and attach it to your tax return.\nIf you want the IRS to figure your EIC for you, see _IRS Will Figure the EIC for You_, earlier.\n#### Special Instructions—EIC Worksheets\nYou will need to decide whether to use EIC Worksheet A or EIC Worksheet B to figure the amount of your EIC. This section explains how to use these worksheets and how to report the EIC on your return.\n**EIC Worksheet A.**\nUse EIC Worksheet A if you weren’t self-employed at any time in 2024 and aren't a member of the clergy, a church employee who files Schedule SE, or a statutory employee filing Schedule C. \n**EIC Worksheet B.**\nUse EIC Worksheet B if you were self-employed at any time in 2024 or are a member of the clergy, a church employee who files Schedule SE, or a statutory employee filing Schedule C. If any of the following situations apply to you, read the paragraph and then complete EIC Worksheet B. \n_**Net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.**_\nIf your net earnings from self-employment are $400 or more, be sure to correctly fill out Schedule SE (Form 1040) and pay the proper amount of self-employment tax. If you don't, you may not get all the EIC you are entitled to receive. \n_**When to use the optional methods of figuring net earnings.**_\nUsing the optional methods on Schedule SE to figure your net earnings from self-employment may qualify you for the EIC or give you a larger credit. If your net earnings (without using the optional methods) are less than $6,920, see the Instructions for Schedule SE for details about the optional methods. \n_**When both spouses have self-employment income.**_\nYou must complete both Parts 1 and 2 of EIC Worksheet B if all of the following conditions apply to you.\n  1. You are married filing a joint return.\n  2. Both you and your spouse have income from self-employment.\n  3. You or your spouse file a Schedule SE and the other spouse doesn't file Schedule SE. \n**Statutory employees.**\nStatutory employees report wages and expenses on Schedule C. They don't file Schedule SE. If you are a statutory employee, enter the amount from line 1 of Schedule C in Part 3 when you complete EIC Worksheet B. \n#### Schedule EIC\nYou must complete Schedule EIC and attach it to your tax return if you have a qualifying child and are claiming the EIC. Schedule EIC provides the IRS with information about your qualifying children, including their names, ages, SSNs, relationship to you, and the amount of time they lived with you during the year.", "zht": "## 4. 計算和申領 EIC\n您必須再符合一項規則才能申領 EIC 。\n您需要知道您的勞動所得金額，以查看您是否符合本章中的規則。您也需要知道該金額來計算您的 EIC 。\n#### 規則 15—勞動所得限額\n您的勞動所得必須低於：\n  * 如果您有三個或更多持有效 SSN 的合資格子女，59,899 美元（已婚聯合申報為 66,819 美元），\n  * 如果您有兩個持有效 SSN 的合資格子女，55,768 美元（已婚聯合申報為 62,688 美元），\n  * 如果您有一個持有效 SSN 的合資格子女，49,084 美元（已婚聯合申報為 56,004 美元），或\n  * 如果您沒有持有效 SSN 的合資格子女， 18,591 美元（已婚聯合申報為 25,511 美元）。\n#### 勞動所得\n勞動所得通常是指工資、薪水、小費、其他應稅員工報酬和自僱淨收入。員工報酬只有在應納稅時才屬於勞動所得。非應稅員工報酬，例如某些被撫養人的照護福利和領養福利，不屬於勞動所得。但非應稅戰鬥報酬有一個例外，您可以選擇將其包含在勞動所得中。勞動所得在第 1 章的 _規則 7_ 中有詳細說明。 \n**計算勞動所得。**\n如果您是提交《附表 SE》（表格 1040）的自僱人士、法定僱員、神職人員或教會僱員，您將透過使用 1040 表說明中第 27 行 _步驟 5_ 的工作表, 然後填寫 1040 表說明中 EIC 工作表 B 第 4 部分計算您的勞動所得。在完成 _步驟 5_ 中的工作表之前，請務必查看 _神職人員_或 _教會員工_, 以適用者為準。. \n_**神職人員。**_\n如果您是提交《附表 SE》的神職人員，並且該附表第 2 行的金額包含也在《表格 1040》或《表格 1040-SR》第 1z 行報告的金額，請從《表格 1040》或《表格 1040-SR》第 1z 行的金額中減去該金額 ，並在《表格 1040》和《表格 1040-SR》第 27 行說明的 _步驟 5 中的_ 工作表的第 1 行輸入結果。請在 （《表格 1040》或《表格 1040-SR》）第 27 行旁邊的虛線上輸入「Clergy」(神職人員)。 \n_**教會員工。**_\n教會員工是指教會或合資格的教會控制組織的員工（牧師或宗教團體成員除外），該組織免於繳納雇主社會安全和醫療保險稅。如果您作為教會員工領取薪資，並且在《附表 SE》第 5a 行和《表格 1040》第 1a 行中包含任何金額，請從《表格 1040》或《1040-SR》第 1a 行中的金額中減去該金額，並在《表格 1040》第 27 行說明的 _步驟 5_ 中的工作表的第 1 行輸入結果。 \n_**醫療補助豁免款項。**_\n在填寫 1040 表格說明, 第 27 行的 _第 5 步_ 中的工作表時，輸入您在附表 1（1040 表）第 8s 行中排除在收入之外的醫療補助豁免款項，除非您選擇將這些金額列入勞動所得，在這種情況下輸入 -0-。關於這些款項的更多資訊，請參見 525 刊物。 \n_**非應稅戰鬥報酬。**_\n您可以選擇將您的非應稅戰鬥報酬計入 EIC 。如果您做出選擇，您必須將您收到的所有非應稅戰鬥報酬包含在勞動所得中。\n如果您提交聯合報稅表並且和您的配偶都獲得了非應稅戰鬥報酬，您可以各自做出自己的選擇。換句話說，如果您們當中的一個人進行了選擇，另一個人也可以進行選擇，但不是必須的。\n您的非應稅戰鬥報酬金額應顯示在您的《表格 W-2》方塊 12 中，代碼為 Q。\n選擇在勞動所得中包含非應稅戰鬥報酬可能會增加或減少您的 EIC 。進行選擇之前，請計算有無非應稅戰鬥報酬的抵免。選擇是否增加或減少您的 EIC 取決於您的總勞動所得、報稅身份和合資格子女的人數。如果您在沒有戰鬥報酬的情況下獲得的勞動所得少於以下所示的您子女人數的金額，您可能會受益於選擇將您的非應稅戰鬥報酬包含在勞動所得中，並且您應該同時計算抵免額。如果您在沒有戰鬥報酬的情況下獲得的勞動所得等於或大於這些金額，您將不會從將戰鬥報酬計入您的勞動所得中受益。\n  * 如果您沒有持有效 SSN 的合資格子女 ，則為 8,260 美元。\n  * 如果您有一個持有效 SSN 的合資格子女 ，則為 12,390 美元。\n  * 如果您有兩個或更多持有效 SSN 的合資格子女 ，則為 17,400 美元。\n#### 國稅局將為您計算 EIC\n如果您按照 1040 表說明第 27 行 的說明進行操作，國稅局將為您計算您的 EIC 金額。\n#### 如何自行計算 EIC\n欲自行計算 EIC ，請使用《表格 1040》說明中的 EIC 工作表。如果您有合資格的子女，請填寫《附表 EIC 》（本章稍後討論）並將其附在您的納稅申報表中。\n如果您希望國稅局為您計算 EIC ，請參閱前文的 _國稅局將為您計算 EIC_。\n#### 特別說明— EIC 工作表\n您需要決定使用 EIC 的工作表 A 或工作表 B 來計算您的 EIC 金額。本節說明如何使用這些工作表以及如何在報稅表上申報 EIC 。\n**EIC 工作表 A。**\n如果您在 2024 年的任何時候不是自僱人士，也不是神職人員、提交《附表 SE》 的教會員工或提交《附表 C 》的法定員工，請使用 EIC 工作表 A。 \n**EIC 工作表 B。**\n如果您在 2024 年的任何時候是自僱人士，或神職人員、提交《附表 SE》的教會員工或提交《附表 C》的法定員工，請使用 EIC 工作表 B。如果以下任何一種情況適用於您，請閱讀該段落，然後完成 EIC 工作表 B。 \n_**自僱淨收入 400 美元或以上。**_\n如果您的自僱淨收入為 400 美元或以上，請務必正確填寫《附表 SE》（《表格1040》）並支付適當金額的自僱稅。如果您不這麼做，您可能無法獲得您有權獲得的所有 EIC 。 \n_**何時使用計算淨收入的可選方法。**_\n使用《附表SE》上的可選方法計算您的自僱淨收入可能會使您有資格獲得 EIC 或為您提供更高的抵免額。如果您的淨收入（不使用可選方法）低於 6,920 美元，請參閱《附表 SE》的說明以了解有關可選方法的詳細資訊。 \n_**當配偶雙方都有自僱收入時。**_\n如果以下所有條件都適用於您，您必須完成 EIC 工作表 B 的第 1 部分和第 2 部分。\n  1. 您已婚並提交聯合報稅表。\n  2. 您和您的配偶都有自僱收入。\n  3. 您或您的配偶提交《附表 SE》，而其中一方未提交《附表 SE》。 \n**法定員工。**\n法定員工在《附表 C》中列舉薪資和支出。他們不提交《附表 SE》。如果您是法定員工，請在填寫 EIC 工作表 B 時輸入第 3 部分《附表 C 》第 1 行中的金額。 \n#### 《附表 EIC》\n如果您有合資格的子女並且要申報 EIC ，您必須填寫《附表 EIC》並將其附在您的納稅申報表中。《附表 EIC》向國稅局提供有關您的合資格子女的資訊，包含其姓名、年齡、社會安全號碼、與您的關係以及在這一年中與您同住的時間。", "article_id": "p596", "doc_idx": 10}

If this applies to you, you may need to complete Form 8862, Information To Claim Certain Credits After Disallowance, and attach it to your 2024 return to claim the credit for 2024. This chapter explains when you need to attach Form 8862. For more information, see Form 8862 and its instructions.\nThis chapter also explains the rules for certain people who can’t claim the EIC for a period of years after their EIC was denied or reduced.\n#### Form 8862\nIf your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied or reduced for any reason other than a math or clerical error, you must attach a completed Form 8862 to your next tax return to claim the EIC. You must also qualify to claim the EIC by meeting all the rules described in this publication.\n**Exception 1.**\nDon't file Form 8862 if either (1) or (2) below is true.\n  1. After your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year:\n    1. You filed Form 8862 in a later year and your EIC for that later year was allowed, and\n    2. Your EIC hasn't been reduced or disallowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.\n  2. You are claiming the EIC without a qualifying child for 2024 and the only reason your EIC was reduced or disallowed in the earlier year was because the IRS determined that a child listed on Schedule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.\nIn either of these cases, you can take the EIC without filing Form 8862 if you meet all the EIC eligibility requirements.\n**Exception 2.**\nDon't file Form 8862 or take the EIC for:\n  * 2 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or \n  * 10 years after there was a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud. \n**More information.**\nFor details, see _Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?_ in this chapter.\nThe date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect whether you need to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return or to a later return.

You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. To claim the EIC with a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to that return. However, to claim the EIC without a qualifying child on your 2024 return, you don't need to file Form 8862.\n**Example 2—Form 8862 required for 2025.**\nThe facts are the same as in the previous example except that you received the statutory notice of deficiency in February 2025. Because the 90-day period referred to in the statutory notice isn't over when you are ready to file your return for 2024, you shouldn't attach Form 8862 to your 2024 return. However, to claim the EIC with a qualifying child for 2025, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year. To claim the EIC without a qualifying child for 2025, you don't need to file Form 8862.\n**Exception for math or clerical errors.**\nIf your EIC was denied or reduced as a result of a math or clerical error, don't attach Form 8862 to your next tax return. For example, if your arithmetic is incorrect, the IRS can correct it. If you don't provide a correct SSN, the IRS can deny the EIC. These types of errors are called math or clerical errors. \n**Omission of Form 8862.**\nIf you are required to attach Form 8862 to your 2024 tax return, and you claim the EIC without attaching a completed Form 8862, your claim will be automatically denied. This is considered a math or clerical error. You won't be permitted to claim the EIC without a completed Form 8862.\n**Additional documents may be required.**\nYou may have to provide the IRS with additional documents or information before a refund relating to the EIC you claim is released to you, even if you attach a properly completed Form 8862 to your return.\n#### Are You Prohibited From Claiming the EIC for a Period of Years?\nIf your EIC for any year after 1996 was denied and it was determined that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 2 years. If your error was due to fraud, then you can’t claim the EIC for the next 10 years. The date on which your EIC was denied and the date on which you file your 2024 return affect the years for which you are prohibited from claiming the EIC. The following examples demonstrate which years you are prohibited from claiming the EIC.\n**Example 3—Cannot claim EIC for 2 years.**\nYou claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in March 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2024 or 2025. To claim the EIC on your return for 2026, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\n**Example 4.**\nThe facts are the same as in _Example 3_ , except that your 2023 EIC wasn’t denied until after you filed your 2024 return. You can’t claim the EIC for tax year 2025 or 2026. To claim the EIC on your return for 2027, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\n**Example 5—Cannot claim EIC for 10 years.**\nYou claimed the EIC on your 2023 tax return, which you filed in February 2024. The IRS determined you weren't entitled to the EIC and that your error was due to fraud. In September 2024, you received a statutory notice of deficiency telling you an adjustment would be made and tax assessed unless you filed a petition with the Tax Court within 90 days. You didn't act on this notice within 90 days. Therefore, your EIC was denied in December 2024. You can’t claim the EIC for tax years 2024 through 2033. To claim the EIC on your return for 2034, you must complete and attach Form 8862 to your return for that year.\nIf you disagree with the final determination of the IRS that you are prohibited from claiming the EIC for a period of years and want to appeal this determination, see the Instructions for Form 8862, _How to appeal the disallowance period_.", "zht": "## 5. EIC 被拒絕\n本章適用於 1996 年之後任何一年的 EIC 被國稅局 拒絕或減少的人。如果這適用於您，您可能需要填寫《表格 8862》「拒絕後申請特定抵免的資訊」，並將其附在您的 2024 年報稅表中，以申請 2024 年的抵免。本章說明了需要附上《表格 8862》的時間點。更多資訊，請參閱《表格 8862》及其說明。\n本章也說明了在 EIC 被拒絕或減少後的幾年內無法再次申請的特定人士的規則。\n#### 《表格 8862》\n如果您的 EIC 在 1996 年之後的任何一年中因數學錯誤或筆誤以外的任何原因被拒絕或減少，您必需將《表格 8862》附在您的下一次納稅申報表中，以申報 EIC 。您也必須符合本刊物中描述的所有規則，才有資格申報 EIC 。\n**例外情況 1。**\n如果以下 (1) 或 (2) 屬實，請勿提交《表格 8862》。\n  1. 您的 EIC 於前一年被減少或拒絕後：\n    1. 您在後一年提交了《表格 8862》，並且\n    2. 您在往後的年度的 EIC 被允許，並且沒有因數學錯誤或筆誤以外的任何原因再次被減少或拒絕。\n  2. 2024 年，您在沒有合資格的子女的情況下申報 EIC ，並且您的 EIC 在前一年被減少或拒絕的唯一原因是因為國稅局判定《附表 EIC》上列出的子女不是您的合資格的子女。\n在上述任一情況下，如果您符合所有 EIC 的資格要求，您無需提交《表格 8862》即可申報 EIC 。\n**例外情況 2。**\n請勿提交《表格 8862》或申報 EIC ：\n  * 在最終判定您的 EIC 申請是由於輕率或故意無視規則造成的 2 年內，或 \n  * 在最終判定您的 EIC 申請是由於詐欺造成的 10 年內。 \n**更多資訊。**\n如需了解詳情，請參閱本章當中的 _您是否在一段時間內被禁止申報 EIC ？_。\n您的 EIC 被拒絕的日期以及您提交 2024 年報稅表的日期會影響您是否需要將《表格 8862》附加到您的 2024 年報稅表或往後的報稅表中。以下範例說明了 2024 年或 2025 年是否需要提交《表格 8862》。\n**範例 1—2024 年所需的《表格 8862》。**\n您於 2024 年 3 月提交了 2023 年的納稅申報表，並申報了有一個合資格子女時可申請的 EIC 。國稅局質疑該 EIC ，並且您無法證明子女是合資格的子女。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠稅通知，告知您除非在 90 天內向稅務法院提交請願書，否則將進行調整並評估稅款。您並未在 90 天內對此通知採取行動。因此，您的 EIC 在2024 年 12 月被拒絕。若要在 2024 年的報稅表中申報有一個合資格子女時可申請的 EIC ，您必須填寫《表格 8862》並將其附在該報稅表上。然而，若要在 2024 年的報稅表上申報沒有合資格子女的情況下可申報的 EIC ，您無需提交《表格 8862》。\n**範例 2—2025 年所需的《表格 8862》。**\n事實與上一個範例相同，不同的是您在 2025 年 2 月收到了法定欠稅通知。由於在您準備提交 2024 年報稅表時，法定通知中提到的 90 天期限尚未結束，因此您不應在 2024 年報稅表中附上 《表格 8862》。然而，若要在 2025 年申報有一個合資格子女時可申請的 EIC ，您必須填寫《表格 8862》並將其附在您該年度的報稅表中。若要在 2025 年的報稅表上申報沒有合資格子女的情況下可申報的 EIC ，您無需提交《表格 8862》。\n**數學錯誤或筆誤的例外情況。**\n如果您的 EIC 因數學錯誤或筆誤而被拒絕或減少，請勿將 《表格 8862》附在您的下一次納稅申報表中。例如，如果您的算術不正確，國稅局可以進行糾正。如果您並未提供正確的社會安全號碼，國稅局可以拒絕 EIC 。這些類型的錯誤稱為數學錯誤或筆誤。 \n**《表格 8862》的遺漏。**\n如果您需要在 2024 年納稅申報表中附上《表格 8862》，並且您在未附上完整的《表格 8862》的情況下申請 EIC ，您的申請將被自動拒絕。這被視為數學錯誤或筆誤。如果沒有完整的《表格 8862》，您將不被允許申領 EIC 。\n**可能需要其他文件。**\n在向您發放與您申請的 EIC 相關的退稅之前，您可能必須向國稅局提供額外的文件或資訊，即使您正確填寫的《表格 8862》已附在報稅表中。\n#### 您是否在一段時間內被禁止申報 EIC ？\n如果您在 1996 年之後的任何一年的 EIC 被拒絕，並且確定您的錯誤是由於草率或故意無視規則所造成的，則您在接下來的 2 年內無法申報 EIC 。如果您的錯誤是由於詐欺造成的，那麼您將無法在接下來的 10 年內申報 EIC 。您的 EIC 被拒絕的日期以及您提交 2024 年報稅表的日期會影響您被禁止申報 EIC 的年度。以下範例說明您被禁止申報 EIC 的年度。\n**範例 3—2 年內無法申報 EIC 。**\n您在 2024 年 3 月提交的 2023 年納稅申報表中申報了 EIC 。國稅局判定您無權獲得 EIC ，並且您的錯誤是由於草率或故意無視其規則造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠稅通知，告知您除非在 90 天內向稅務法院提交請願書，否則將進行調整並評估稅款。您並未在 90 天內對此通知採取行動。因此，您的 EIC 在 2024 年 12 月被拒絕。您無法申請 2024 或 2025 納稅年度的 EIC 。若要在 2026 年的報稅表中申報 EIC ，您必須填寫並附上《表格 8862》到您該年度的報稅表。\n**範例 4。**\n事實與 _範例 3 相同_ ，除了您的 2023 年 EIC 直到您提交了 2024 年的報稅表後才被拒絕。您無法申請 2025 或 2026 納稅年度的 EIC 。若要在 2027 年的報稅表中申報 EIC ，您必須填寫並附上《表格 8862》到您該年度的報稅表。\n**範例 5—10 年內無法申報 EIC 。**\n您在 2024 年 2 月提交的 2023 年納稅申報表中申報了 EIC 。國稅局判定您無權獲得 EIC ，並且您的錯誤是由於詐欺造成的。2024 年 9 月，您收到了法定欠稅通知，告知您除非在 90 天內向稅務法院提交請願書，否則將進行調整並評估稅款。您並未在 90 天內對此通知採取行動。因此，您的 EIC 在2024 年 12 月被拒絕。您無法申請 2024 至 2033 納稅年度的 EIC 。若要在 2034 年的報稅表中申報 EIC ，您必須填寫並附上《表格 8862》到您該年度的報稅表。\n如果您不同意 IRS 的最終決定，即您在一段時間內被禁止申報 EIC，並且想要對此決定提出上訴，請參閱 8862 表格的說明， _如何對禁止期提出上訴_ 。", "article_id": "p596", "doc_idx": 11}

This includes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar information for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts.\n  * Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft, the IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protection for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n  * Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN).

Go to IRS.gov/DirectFile for more information, program updates, and frequently asked questions.\n  * **Free File.** This program lets you prepare and file your federal individual income tax return for free using software or Free File Fillable Forms. However, state tax preparation may not be available through Free File. Go to IRS.gov/FreeFile to see if you qualify for free online federal tax preparation, e-filing, and direct deposit or payment options.\n  * **VITA.** The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax help to people with low-to-moderate incomes, persons with disabilities, and limited-English-speaking taxpayers who need help preparing their own tax returns.

A paid tax preparer is:\n  * Primarily responsible for the overall substantive accuracy of your return, \n  * Required to sign the return, and\n  * Required to include their preparer tax identification number (PTIN).\n**Employers can register to use Business Services Online.**\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers online service at SSA.gov/employer for fast, free, and secure W-2 filing options to CPAs, accountants, enrolled agents, and individuals who process Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement; and Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement.\n**Business tax account.**\nIf you are a sole proprietor, a partnership, or an S corporation, you can view your tax information on record with the IRS and do more with a business tax account.

If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you’re a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take.\n  * Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN).

{"en": "#### Form Required\nUse IRS Form 2848 to appoint a recognized representative to act on your behalf before the IRS. Individuals recognized to represent you before the IRS are listed under _Part II, Declaration of Representative,_ of Form 2848. Your representative must complete that part of the form.\n**Non-IRS powers of attorney.**\nThe IRS will accept a non-IRS power of attorney, but a completed Form 2848 must be attached in order for the power of attorney to be entered on the Centralized Authorization File (CAF) system. For more information, see  _Processing a non-IRS power of attorney_ , later. \nIf you want to use a document other than Form 2848 to authorize the representation, it must contain the following information. \n  * Your name and mailing address.\n  * Your social security number (or your individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN)) and/or employer identification number.\n  * Your employee plan number, if applicable.\n  * The name and mailing address of your representative(s).\n  * The types of tax involved.\n  * The federal tax form number.\n  * The specific year(s) or period(s) involved.\n  * For estate tax matters, the decedent's date of death.\n  * A clear expression of your intention concerning the scope of authority granted to your representative(s).\n  * Your signature and date.\nYou also must attach to the non-IRS power of attorney a signed and dated statement made by your representative. This statement, which is referred to as the Declaration of Representative, is contained in Part II of Form 2848. The statement should read: \n  1. I am not currently under suspension or disbarment from practice before the Internal Revenue Service or other practice of my profession by any other authority,\n  2. I am subject to regulations contained in Circular 230 (31 C.F.R., Subtitle A, Part 10) as amended, governing practice before the Internal Revenue Service,\n  3. I am authorized to represent the taxpayer(s) identified in the power of attorney, and\n  4. I am a (naming the capacity in which representation is undertaken, as set forth in the list of eligible representatives at Part II of Form 2848.)\n_**Required information missing.**_\nThe IRS will not accept your non-IRS power of attorney if it does not contain all the information listed above. You can sign and submit a completed Form 2848 or a new non-IRS power of attorney that contains all the information. If you cannot sign an acceptable replacement document, your attorney-in-fact may be able to perfect (make acceptable to the IRS) your non-IRS power of attorney by using the procedure described next. \n_**Procedure for perfecting a non-IRS power of attorney.**_\nUnder the following conditions, the attorney-in-fact named in your non-IRS power of attorney can sign a Form 2848 on your behalf. \n  1. The original non-IRS power of attorney grants authority to handle federal tax matters (for example, general authority to perform any acts).\n  2. The attorney-in-fact attaches a statement (signed under penalty of perjury) to the Form 2848 stating that the original non-IRS power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction.\n**Example.**\nJohn Elm, a taxpayer, signs a non-IRS durable power of attorney that names his neighbor and CPA, Ed Larch, as his attorney-in-fact. The power of attorney grants Ed the authority to perform any and all acts on John's behalf. However, it does not list specific tax-related information such as types of tax or tax form numbers.\nShortly after John signs the power of attorney, he is declared incompetent. Later, a federal tax matter arises concerning a prior year return filed by John. Ed attempts to represent John before the IRS but is rejected because the durable power of attorney does not contain required information.\nIf Ed attaches a statement (signed under the penalty of perjury) that the durable power of attorney is valid under the laws of the governing jurisdiction, he can sign a completed Form 2848 and submit it on John's behalf. If Ed can practice before the IRS (see  _Who Can Practice Before the IRS_ , earlier), he can name himself as representative on Form 2848. Otherwise, he must name another individual who can practice before the IRS.\n_**Processing a non-IRS power of attorney.**_\nThe IRS has a centralized computer database system called the CAF system. This system contains information on the authority of taxpayer representatives. Generally, when you submit a power of attorney document to the IRS, it is processed for inclusion on the CAF system. Entry of your power of attorney on the CAF system enables IRS personnel, who do not have a copy of your power of attorney, to verify the authority of your representative by accessing the CAF. It also enables the IRS to automatically send copies of notices and other IRS communications to your representative if you specify that your representative should receive those communications.\nYou can have your non-IRS power of attorney entered on the CAF system by attaching it to a completed Form 2848 and submitting it to the IRS. Your signature is not required; however, your attorney-in-fact must sign the _Declaration of Representative_(see Part II of Form 2848).
