_**필수 정보 누락.**_

**예시.**
납세자 존 엘름은 그의 이웃이자 CPA인 에드 라치를 사실상의 대변인으로 지정하는 비IRS 항구적 위임장에 서명합니다. 위임장은 에드에게 존을 대신하여 모든 행동을 대신할 수 있는 권한을 부여했습니다. 그러나 세금 유형이나 세금 양식 번호와 같은 특정 세금 관련 정보는 나열하지 않았습니다.
존이 위임장에 서명한 직후, 그는 무능한 상태라는 선고를 받았습니다. 나중에 존이 제출한 전년도 신고서에 관한 연방 세금 문제가 발생합니다. 에드는 IRS에 존을 대변하려고 시도하지만, 항구적 위임장에는 필수 정보가 포함되어 있지 않기 때문에 거부됩니다.
에드가 이 항구적 위임장이 관할권의 법률에 따라 유효하다는 진술서 (위증 시 처벌을 받는다는 서명을 한)를 첨부하는 경우, 작성된 양식 2848에 서명하고 존을 대신하여 제출할 수 있습니다. 만약 에드가 IRS 상대 업무를 수행할 수 있다면 (이전의 [_IRS 상대 업무를 수행할 수 있는 사람은 누구인가?_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink1000148595 "IRS 상대 업무를 수행할 수 있는 사람은 누구인가?")를 참조), 양식 2848에서 스스로를 대변인으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 IRS 상대 업무를 수행할 수 있는 다른 사람을 지명해야 합니다.
_**비IRS 위임장 처리.**_
IRS는 CAF 시스템이라고 불리는 중앙 컴퓨터 데이터베이스 시스템을 가지고 있습니다. 이 시스템에는 납세자 대변인의 권한에 대한 정보가 포함되어 있습니다. 일반적으로 위임장을 IRS에 제출하면 CAF 시스템에 포함되도록 처리됩니다. CAF 시스템에 위임장을 입력하면 위임장 사본이 없는 IRS 직원이 CAF에 접속하여 대변인의 권한 확인을 가능하게 합니다. 또한, IRS는 대변인이 통지서 및 기타 IRS 통신문을 수신해야 한다고 지정한 경우, 통지서 사본 및 기타 IRS 통신문을 대변인에게 자동으로 전송할 수 있습니다.
비IRS 위임장을 작성된 양식 2848에 첨부하고 IRS에 제출하면 CAF 시스템에 입력시킬 수 있습니다. 귀하의 서명은 필요하지 않습니다. 그러나 사실상의 변호인은 반드시 _Declaration of Representative_ (대변인 지정)에 서명해야 합니다. (이전의 양식 2848의 Part ll 를 참조하십시오). 
#### 양식 작성 — 유용한 힌트
양식 2848의 작성은 추후 [_양식 2848을 어떻게 작성해야 합니까?_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink1000148681 "양식 2848을 어떻게 작성해야 합니까?")의 예시에서 설명됩니다. 그러나 다음과 같은 사항도 양식을 작성하는 데 도움이 됩니다.
**항목별 힌트.**
다음 힌트는 양식 2848을 위한 항목별 설멍서 중 일부를 요약한 것입니다.
_**Line 1–Taxpayer information. (항목 1-납세자 정보)**_
부부 공동 세금 신고서와 관련된 경우, 남편과 아내는 대변인이 동일인이라 하더라도 둘 다 대변인을 원하는 경우 각각 별도의 양식 2848을 제출해야 합니다. 한 명의 배우자만 해당 사안을 위임하고자 하는 경우, 해당 배우자가 양식 2848을 제출합니다. 만 18세 미만의 납세자 개인이 서명할 수 없는 경우, 개인의 부모 또는 법원이 지정한 보호자 (법원 문서 포함)가 대신하여 서명할 수 있습니다. 부모 또는 법원이 지정한 보호자가 납세자 개인을 대신하여 서명하도록 승인하는 양식 2848이 있는 경우 다른 개인이 납세자를 위해 서명할 수 있습니다. 
_**Line 2–Representative(s). (항목 2-대변인(들))**_
오직 개인만이 대변인으로 지명될 수 있습니다. 대변인에게 CAF 번호가 할당되지 않은 경우, "None" (없음)을 해당 항목에 입력하면 IRS가 대변인에게 번호를 발급할 것입니다. CAF 번호가 발급된 이후 대변인의 주소 또는 전화번호가 변경된 경우, 해당 확인란을 선택해야 합니다. 대변인의 팩스 번호가 있을 경우 이를 입력하십시오.
4명 이상의 대변인을 지정하려면 양식 2848을 추가로 첨부하십시오. IRS는 최대 두 명의 대변인에게 통지서 및 통신문 사본을 보낼 것입니다. 그러나 **반드시** 양식 2848의 line 2에 있는 확인란을 선택해야 IRS가 정기적으로 통지서 및 통신문 사본을 귀하의 대변인에게 보낼 수 있습니다. 확인란을 선택하지 않으면 대변인이 정기적으로 통지서 및 통신문 사본을 받지 못 할 것입니다. 
_**Line 3–Acts authorized (Tax matters). (항목 3 - 승인된 행위 (세금 문제))**_
현재 연도/기간과 위임장에 서명한 날로부터 이미 종료된 세금 연도 또는 기간을 기재할 수 있습니다. 향후 세금 연도 또는 기간을 나열할 수도 있습니다. **그러나 IRS은 IRS이 위임장을 수령한 해의 12월 31일로부터 3년을 초과하는 향후 납세 연도 또는 기간을 CAF 시스템에 기록하지 않습니다.** " All years," (모든 연도)"All periods," (모든 기간) 또는 "All taxes" (모든 세금)과 같은 보편적인 언급을 사용하지 마십시오. IRS는 이런 보편적인 언급이 사용된 위임장을 반납할것 입니다. 
_**Line 4–Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). (항목 4-중앙 승인 파일 (CAF)에 기록되지 않은 특정 용도)**_
특정 사안은 CAF 시스템에 기록될 수 없습니다. 이러한 사안의 예는 다음을 포함하지만 이에 국한되지 않습니다. (조금 더 자세한 목록은 양식 2848의 설명서에 있습니다.)
  * 계별예규 또는 기술 자문에 대한 요청.
  * 고용주 식별 번호 (EIN) 신청.
  * 양식 843, 환급 청구 및 감면 요청.
  * 기업 해체.
  * 회계 방식 변경 요청.
  * 회계 기간 변경 요청.
  * sections 501(c)(3), 501(a) 또는 521에 따른 면제 인정 신청서 (양식 1023, 1024 또는 1028).
  * 종업원 복지 계획의 적격 상태 결정 요청 (양식 5300, 5307 또는 5310).
  * section 7623에 따른 원본 정보에 대한 포상 신청서.
  * 직원 계획 준수 해결 시스템 (EPCRS)에 따른 임의 제출.
  * 정보 자유법 요청 


양식 2848의 line 3에 설명된 세금 문제가 위의 문제 중 하나와 관련된 경우 line 4의 확인란을 선택하십시오. 이 확인란이 선택되었다면, 이 사안을 담당하는 IRS 사무실로 대변인은 위임장을 우편 또는 팩스로 보내야 합니다. 그렇지 않은 경우, 대변인은 IRS과의 각 회의에 위임장 사본을 지참해야 합니다. 
#### 위임장 제출 장소
일반적으로 양식 2848을 IRS에 직접 우편 또는 팩스로 보낼 수 있습니다. 양식 2848의 제출 장소를 결정하려면 양식 2848의 설명서에서 _Where To File_ (제출 장소)를 참조하십시오.
만약 양식 2848이 특정 용도로 쓰일 것이라면, 우편 또는 팩스로 해당 문제를 처리하는 사무실에 보내십시오. 특정 용도에 대한 자세한 내용은 _Line 4–Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). (항목 4-중앙 승인 파일 (CAF)에 기록되지 않은 특정 용도)_ 를 양식 2848의 설명서에서 참조하십시오.
_**팩스 사본.**_
IRS은 팩스 전송을 통해 제출된 위임장 사본을 수락합니다. 위임장을 팩스로 제출하는 경우, 해당 IRS에서 이러한 유형의 전송을 수락할 수 있는지 확인해야합니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 대변인은 IRS 웹사이트를 통해 전자식으로 양식 2848을 제출할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용을 위해 귀하의 대변인은_[IRS.gov/eServices](https://www.irs.gov/ko/e-services) _를 방문할 수 있습니다. 전자 서명 승인을 위해 양식 2848을 작성하는 경우, IRS에 양식 2848을 제출하지 마십시오. 대신, 문서를 보관할 대변인에게 전달하십시오._.
**위임장 업데이트.**
기존 위임장에 대한 업데이트 또는 수정 사항을 서면으로 제출하십시오. 귀하의 서명 (또는 귀하를 대신하여 서명할 권한이 있는 개인의 서명)이 요구됩니다. 업데이트된 양식 2848 또는 비IRS 위임장을 관련 신고서가 제출되었거나 제출될 서비스 센터를 포함한 이전에 원본을 보낸 IRS 사무소에 보내면 됩니다.
기존 위임장에서 대변인에게 대변인을 대체 또는 위임할 수 있는 권한을 구체적으로 부여한 경우 공인 대변인은 권한을 대체하거나 위임할 수 있습니다. 대변인은 대체 또는 위임을 위해, 다음과 같은 항목을 위임장을 제출했던 IRS 사무소로 제출해야 합니다. 
  1. 공인 대변인이 서명한 대체 또는 위임의 서면 통지.
  2. 신규 대변인의 서면 대변인 지정
  3. 대체 또는 위임을 구체적으로 승인하는 위임장 사본.


#### 이전 위임장 유지/해지
동일한 사안에 대해 새로 제출된 위임장은 이전에 제출된 위임장을 취소시킵니다. 그러나, 새로운 위임장에 이전 위임장을 취소시키지 않는다고 구체적으로 명시되어 있고, 또한 다음 중 어느 하나라도 새로운 위임장에 첨부되어 있다면 이전 위임장은 취소되지 않습니다.
  * 취소되지 않은 이전 위임장 사본 또는
  * 이전에 취소되지 않은 위임장에서 위임된 각 대변인의 이름과 주소가 기재된 납세자가 서명한 진술서.


### 참고.
양식 2848을 제출해도 현재 유효한 그 어떤 양식 8821도 취소되지 않습니다.
#### 위임장 취소/대변인 철회
**납세자에 의한 취소.**
이전에 이행된 위임장을 취소하며 새 대변인의 이름을 지정하지 않으려면 양식 2848의 첫 페이지 상단에서 현재 서명과 이 주석 바로 아래에 "REVOKE" (취소)라고 적어야 합니다. 그런 다음, 취소 주석이 담긴 위임장 사본을 _양식 2848 설명서의 제출 장소 차트를_ 사용하여 IRS에 우편 또는 팩스로 보내야 하며 또는 이 위임장이 특정 사안에 대한 경우 해당 사안을 처리하는 IRS 사무소에 제출하십시오.
취소하려는 위임장의 사본이 없는 경우, 위임장의 권한이 취소되었음을 나타내는 취소 진술서를 IRS에 보내야 합니다. 위임장에는 해당 사안과 연도/기간이 기재되어 있어야 하며, 권한이 취소된 각 공인 대변인의 이름과 주소가 기재되어 있어야 합니다. 이 진술서에 반드시 서명 및 날짜를 표기해야 합니다. 권한을 완전히 취소하는 경우 특정 사안과 연도/기간을 나열하는 대신 "remove all years/periods" (모든 년도/기간 삭제)을 기입하십시오.
**대변인에 의한 철회.**
대변인이 대변인 직을 철회하고자 하는 경우, 대변인은 양식 2848의 첫 페이지 상단에서 현재 서명과 주석 바로 아래에 "WITHDRAW" (철회)라고 적어야 합니다. 그런 다음, [_납세자에 의한 취소_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink100030094 "납세자에 의한 취소.")에서 설명한 것과 같은 방법으로 IRS에 철회 주석이 있는 위임장 사본을 제출해야 합니다. 대변인에게 철회를 원하는 위임장의 사본이 없는 경우, IRS에 위임장이 철회되었음을 나타내는 철회 진술서, 사안 및 연도/기간을 기재하고 납세자의 이름, TIN 및 주소 (알려진 경우)를 기재해야 합니다. 대변인은 이 진술서에 서명 및 날짜를 표기해야 합니다.
학생이 소지한 위임장은 수령일로부터 130일 동안 CAF 시스템에 기록됩니다. 그 이후 학생이 귀하를 대리하도록 승인하는 경우, 업데이트된 양식 2848을 다시 제출해야 합니다.
#### 위임장이 필요하지 않은 경우는 언제입니까?
제삼자가 대변인으로서 IRS 상대 업무를 하지 않는 경우 위임장이 필요하지 않습니다. 다음과 같은 상황에는 위임장이 필요하지 않습니다.
  * IRS에 정보 제공.
  * 양식 8821, _세금 정보 허가,_ 또는 기타 서면 또는 구두 공개 합의서를 사용해 세금 신고서 정보 공개 허가.
  * IRS가 세금 신고서 또는 기타 문서에 제공된 확인란을 통해 제삼자와 세금 신고 정보를 논의할 수 있도록 허용.
  * 파트너쉽 대변인 (PR)이 2017년 12월 31일 이후 시작되는 과세 연도의 중앙 집중식 파트너쉽 감사 체제 하에서 파트너쉽을 위한 행위를 수행하도록 허용; 그러나, 조기 선택위해 아래의 주의사항 (CAUTION)을 보십시오.
  * 2018년 1월 1일 이전에 종료되는 파트너쉽 과세 연도를 위해 세금 관련 파트너 (TMP)가 파트너쉽을 위한 업무를 수행하도록 허용.
  * IRS이 수탁자와 신고 정보를 논의할 수 있도록 허용.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_2017년 12월 31일 이후 시작된 파트너쉽 과세 연도의 경우, 2015년 양당 예산법은 TEFRA 파트너쉽 감사 및 소송 절차와 대규모 파트너쉽을 선출하는 데 적용되는 규칙을 폐지하고 새로운 중앙 집중식 파트너쉽 감사 체제로 대체했으며, " tax matters parter"(세금 관련 파트너)의 역할을 없애고 "partnership representative" (파트너쉽 대변인)로 대체했습니다. 재무 규정 제 301.9100-22T 항에 따라, 특정 파트너쉽은 2015년 11월 2일 이후부터 2018년 1월 1일 이전에 시작되는 과세 연도의 파트너쉽 신고에 새로운 체제가 적용되도록 선택할 수 있습니다._.
#### 양식 2848을 어떻게 작성해야 합니까?
다음 예제는 양식 2848의 작성 방법을 보여줍니다.
**예시.**
스탠과 메리 도는 2014년, 2015년, 2016년의 공동 소득세 신고서 (양식 1040)가 감사 중이라는 통지를 받았습니다. 그들은 등록된 세무사인 짐 스미스를 이 사안과 이 신고서에 관한 향후 사안에 대한 대변인으로 임명하기로 결정했습니다. 수년 동안 같은 위치에서 신고서를 작성한 짐에게는 이미 중앙 승인 파일 (CAF) 번호가 할당되어 있습니다. 메리는 짐이 자신을 대신해 계약서에 서명하는 것을 원하지 않지만 스탠은 짐이 서명하도록 할 의향이 있습니다. 스탠과 메리는 또한 짐이 중개 서비스 제공자를 사용하여 IRS 기록에 접속할 수 있도록 승인합니다. 그들은 짐에게 보내지는 모든 통지서와 서면 통신의 사본을 원합니다. 스탠과 메리가 다른 사람에게 위임장을 준 것은 이번이 처음입니다. 이들은 각각 양식 2848을 다음과 같이 작성해야 합니다.
**Line 1–Taxpayer information. (항목 1-납세자 정보)**
스탠과 메리는 각자의 양식 2848을 별도로 제출해야 합니다. 스탠은 자신의 별도 양식 2848에 자신의 이름, 도로명 주소 및 사회보장번호를 제공된 공간에 입력합니다. 마찬가지로 마리아도 자신의 별도 양식 2848을 같은 방법으로 작성합니다.
**Line 2–Representative(s). (항목 2-대변인(들))**
각자의 양식 2848에 스탠과 메리는 각각 선택한 대변인 짐 스미스의 이름과 현재 주소를 입력합니다. 스탠과 메리는 짐 스미스가 line 3에서 식별된 문제에 관한 통지 및 통신을 받기를 원합니다. 따라서 별도의 양식 2848에서 스탠과 메리는 line 2의 첫 번째 열에 있는 상자를 각각 체크합니다. 또한 스미스 씨의 CAF 번호, 작성자 세금 식별 번호 (PTIN), 전화번호 및 팩스 번호를 입력합니다. 스미스 씨의 주소, 전화번호 및 팩스 번호는 IRS가 CAF 번호를 발급한 이후 변경되지 않았으므로 스탠과 메리는 두 번째 열의 확인란을 선택하지 않습니다.
**Line 3–Acts authorized (Tax matters). (항목 3 - 승인된 행위 (세금 문제))**
각자의 양식 2848에 스탠과 마리아가 각각 다음 사항을 입력합니다. description of the matter (사안 설명)에는 "income tax" (소득세) , form number (양식 번호)에는"1040", 및 tax years (과세 연도)에는 "2014, 2015, and 2016" 을 입력합니다.
**Line 4–Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). (항목 4-중앙 승인 파일 (CAF)에 기록되지 않은 특정 용도)**
각자의 양식 2848에서 스탠과 메리는 CAF에 기록되지 않은 특정 용도로 위임장의 사용을 제한하고 싶지 않기 때문에 이 항목에 아무것도 입력하지 않습니다. 이전의 [_양식 작성 — 유용한 힌트_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink1000148651 "양식 작성 — 유용한 힌트")를 참조하십시오.
**Line 5–Additional acts authorized and restrictions. (항목 5-추가적인 행위의 승인 및 제한)**
메리는 자신과 스탠의 공동 2014, 2015, 2016년 소득세 채무의 변경 사항을 반영하는 모든 합의서에 서명하고 싶어 합니다. 그래서 그녀는 "Taxpayer must sign any agreement form”" (납세자가 모든 합의 양식에 서명해야 한다)이라고 양식 2848의 line 5b에 적습니다. 스탠은 이와 관련하여 짐 스미스의 권한을 제한하고 싶지 않으므로 양식 2848의 line 5b를 비워 둡니다. 메리 또는 스탠 중 한 명이 선택했다면 별도의 양식 2848의 5b 항목에 다른 제한 사항을 나열 할 수 있습니다. 또한, 메리와 스탠 모두 5a 항목의 "Access my IRS records via an Intermediate Service Provider" (중개 서비스 제공자를 통해 나의 IRS 기록에 접속) 확인란을 선택하여 짐이 중개 서비스 제공자를 통해 IRS 기록에 접속하게 할 수 있습니다.
**Line 6–Retention/revocation of prior power(s) of attorney. (항목 6— 이전 위임장 유지/해지)**
스탠과 메리는 각자의 첫 번째 위임장을 제출합니다. 그래서 그들은 이 라인에 아무것도 입력하지 않습니다. 현재 위임장의 항목 6의 확인란을 선택하고 효력을 유지하고자 하는 이전 위임장 사본을 첨부하지 않는 이상, 동일한 세금 문제에 대한 현재 위임장을 제출하게되면, 이전에 제출된 위임장이 있다면 이는 취소됩니다.
나중에 메리가 스스로 세무감사에 대응할 수 있다고 결정하면 스탠이 위임장을 취소하지 않더라도 자신의 위임장을 취소할 수 있습니다. (이전의 [_위임장 취소/대변인 철회_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink1000148663 "위임장 취소/대변인 철회")를 참조하여 적용되는 특별한 규칙을 확인하십시오.)
**Line 7–Signature of taxpayer. (항목 7-납세자의 서명)**
스탠과 메리는 각자의 양식 2848에 서명하고 날짜를 기입합니다. 납세자가 서명하지 않으면 IRS는 양식을 수락할 수 없습니다.
**Part II-Declaration of Representative. (제2부—대변인 지정)**
짐 스미스는 양식 2848의 이 부분을 작성해야 합니다. 그가 서명하지 않으면 IRS는 양식을 수락할 수 없습니다. 
#### 제출 된 위임장은 어떻게 됩니까?
위임장은 IRS에 의해 접수, 검토 및 요구된 정보가 포함 되었다고 판명이 난 후에 인정됩니다. 그러나 CAF 시스템에 위임장이 입력될 때까지 IRS 직원은 귀하를 대변하도록 지명된 사람의 권한을 알지 못할 수 있습니다. 따라서 이 중간 기간 동안 IRS 직원은 귀하 또는 귀하의 대변인이 IRS과의 회의에 사본을 지참하도록 요청할 수 있습니다.
#### 처리 및 취급
위임장의 처리 및 처리 방법은 이가 완성 또는 미완성 서류인지 여부에 따라 달라집니다.
**미완성 문서.**
양식 2848이 미완성인 경우 IRS는 귀하 또는 귀하의 대변인에게 서면 또는 전화상으로 누락된 정보 확보를 시도할 것입니다. 예를 들어, 서명 또는 서명 날짜가 누락된 경우 IRS는 귀하에게 연락할 것입니다. 대변인 관련 정보가 누락되었으나 적절한 연락처 (예: 주소 및/또는 전화번호) 정보가 서류에 있는 경우 IRS은 대변인에게 연락을 시도할 것입니다.
두 경우 모두 서류에 모든 필수 정보가 입력될 때까지 위임장이 유효한 것으로 간주되지 않습니다. 서류가 완성되고 이를 IRS에 수락되기 전까지 대변인으로 지명된 개인의 귀하를 대신한 IRS 상대업무를 수행할 권한이 인정되지 않습니다.
**완성 문서.**
위임장이 완전하고 유효한 경우 IRS는 대변인을 인정하기 위한 조치를 취할 것입니다. 대부분의 경우 이는 CAF 시스템에서 이 문서를 처리하는 것을 포함합니다. CAF 시스템에 이 정보를 기록하면 IRS는 공인 대변인에게 우편물의 사본을 전달하고 부여된 권한의 범위를 쉽게 인식할 수 있습니다. 
_**CAF에서 처리되지 않은 서류.**_
특정 사용 위임장은 CAF 시스템에서 처리되지 않습니다 (이전의 [_양식 작성 — 유용한 힌트_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947ko#ko_201709_publink1000148651 "양식 작성 — 유용한 힌트")를 참조하십시오). 예를 들어, 일회성 또는 특정 사안에 대한 권한 부여 위임장은 CAF 시스템에서 처리되지 않습니다. 이 문서는 관련 사안 파일과 함께 남아 있습니다. 이 경우 양식 2848의 line 4에서 확인란을 선택해야 합니다. 이 경우, 대표자는 IRS과의 각 회의에 위임장 사본을 지참해야 합니다. 
#### 대변인 상대하기
유효한 위임장이 제출된 후 IRS은 귀하의 대변인을 인정할 것입니다. 하지만 대변인이 반복 요청 후 비특권 정보를 제공하지 못하여 IRS의 신속한 사안 처리를 부당하게 지연시키거나 방해한 책임이 있는 것으로 판단되는 경우 IRS는 귀하에게 직접 연락할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 위임장이 인정되는 대부분의 경우 IRS은 대변인에게 연락하여 약속을 잡고 대변인에게 요구되는 항목 목록을 제공할 것입니다. 단, 대변인에게 연락할 수 없고, 대변인이 반복된 요청에 응답하지 않으며, 요구된 항목 (기밀로 간주되는 항목 제외)을 제공하지 않는 경우, IRS 담당자를 우회하여 귀하에게 직접 연락할 수 있습니다.
대변인이 위에서 설명한 행동에 참여하는 경우, 이 사안에 대한 가능한 징계 조치를 고려하기 위해 전문인 책무 사무국에 회부될 수 있습니다.
**통지서 및 기타 서신.**
IRS가 귀하에게 보내는 모든 통지서 및 통신문의 사본을 대변인이 받을 수 있도록 승인하려면 대변인의 이름과 주소 아래에 있는 확인란을 선택해야 합니다.**IRS가 귀하에게 보낸 통지서 및 통신문 사본을 두 명 이상의 대변인은 받을 수 없습니다.** 대변인(들)에게 통지서 및 통신문 사본을 보내지 않으려면 확인란을 선택하지 마십시오.
### 참고.
대변인은 서신과 함께 양식, 간행물 및 기타 관련 자료를 받지 않을 것입니다.
