**可以担任代表的其他人士。**
由于以下人士与纳税人的特殊关系，他们可以在 IRS 代表指定的纳税人，但是他们要出示符合要求的身份证明以及（除非下文第 (1) 项所述的人士）代表纳税人的 授权证明。
  1. _**委托书。**_ 个人可以在 IRS 代表自己，不需要提交书面的资格和授权声明。
  2. _**家人。**_ 个人可代表其家人。直系亲属包括个人的配偶、子女、父母、兄弟或姐妹。
  3. _**高级管理人员（官员）。**_ 公司（包括母公司、子公司或其他关联公司）、社团或组织集团的合法高级管理人员可以代表该公司、社团或组织集团。政府单位、机关或机构的官员，在其执行公务过程中，可以在 IRS 代表该政府单位、机关或机构。

#### 代表美国境外的纳税人
代表美国境外个人或实体的行为在美国境外发生时，任何人士均可在 IRS 工作人员面前代表该个人或实体。参见第 230 号公告第 10.7(c)(1)(vii) 节。
#### 特别出席授权
国税局局长或其代表可以授权无资格在 IRS 代理纳税人执业的人士就某一特定事项代表他人。预期代表必须向职责办公室申请本书面授权。但是，只有在极为令人信服的情况下，才会授予该授权书。如果获批，税务局长（或代表）将出具信函，其中详述到场相关的条件，以及之所以授予授权的具体税务事项。
授权书不应与 IRS 中心的函件相混淆，后者告知个人其已被分配集中授权文件 (CAF) 号码。签发 CAF 编号并不表明某人士获得认可或者获得授权在 IRS 代理纳税人执业。此项操作仅确认，已经为该人士建立该编号下的集中授权文件。
**在 LITC 和 STCP 内工作的学生。**
在低收入纳税者服务处 (LITC) 或学生税收服务中心计划 (STCP) 工作的学生，必须收到其作为法学生、商学生或会计学生身份的许可，才能在 IRS 代表纳税人。授权申请必须发送至纳税人辩护服务处。如果获批，该局将签发一份函件，授权该生在特殊情况下到场，并详述到场相关的任何条件。收到授权书的学生通常可以在授权书中载明的任何条件下，在 IRS 职能部门或办公室代表纳税人；并且收到获得授权在 IRS 代理纳税人执业的人士的直接监督。如果您想让学生代表您，请查看委托书；如果您对授权条款有疑问，请咨询您的学生、学生的监督人或纳税人辩护服务处。
#### 谁不得在 IRS 代理纳税人执业？
通常，不具备资格的人士，或者由于某些行动丧失特权的人士，不得在 IRS 代理纳税人执业。如果个人丧失执业资格，IRS 对于指定该人为代表的委托书不予认可。
**非个人的公司、社团、合伙企业或其他个人。**
这些组织（或个人）无资格在 IRS 代理纳税人执业。
#### 丧失资格
通常，个人通过以下方式丧失在 IRS 代理纳税人执业的资格。
  * 不符合续展注册要求（例如，继续专业教育）。
  * 作为注册报税代理人要求处于不活跃的退休状态。
  * 因违反第 230 号通告中载明的条例或第 81-38 号《税收程序》中载明的标准， 被职责办公室停职或取消资格、或确定不具备执业资格。
  * 丧失作为律师或注册会计师的州执业执照，无论吊销执照的依据是什么。


**未满足要求。**
IRS 会对未满足续展要求的注册个人和 AFSP 完成记录持有人发出通知。通知解释不合格的原因，并为个人提供及时提交复议信息的机会。
_**不活跃名单。**_
如果注册个人出现以下情况，则将其列入不活跃注册个人名单，为期三年：
  * 未及时回应不符合续展要求的通知，
  * 未及时申请续展，或者
  * 不满足续展要求。


注册个人必须在 3 年内提交续展申请 _**以及**_ 满足被列入不活跃状态后的所有续展要求。否则，在下一个续展周期结束时，将其从名单中除去，注册状态终止。
**不活跃退休状态。**

谴责为公开谴责。受第 230 号通告规限的个人包括从事纳税人代表或提供建议活动的律师、注册会计师、注册报税代理人、注册退休计划代理人或注册精算师，以及代表纳税人的任何年度申报季计划完成记录持有人和为联邦税收目的评估资产价值的任何估价师。
#### 向代表授权
您可以在 IRS 代表自己，也可以授权个人在 IRS 代表您。如果您选择让某人代表您，您的代表必须是有资格在 IRS 代表您的人士。参见后文 [_“谁可以在在 IRS 代理纳税人执业”_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148595 "谁可以在 IRS 代理纳税人执业？")。
#### 何为委托书？
委托书是您对个人的书面授权，其代表您从 IRS 接收您的机密税收信息并采取某些行动。如果该授权不受限制，则个人一般可以执行您可以执行的所有行为，但议付或背书支票除外。授予注册退休计划代理人、注册精算师和持有完成记录的注册报税员的权限是有限的。若要了解年度申报季计划完成记录持有人相关的限制信息，参见 2014-42 税收程序以及 [IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Return-Preparer-Office-RPO-At-a-Glance （英文）](https://www.irs.gov/zh-hans/tax-professionals/return-preparer-office-rpo-at-a-glance)。
**执行的行为。**
律师、注册会计师及注册报税代理人可执行下列行为：
  1. 在 IRS 任何办公室或员工面前代表您。
  2. 签署对征税或征收欠税限制的提议书或放弃书，或签署驳回抵免或退税申请的通知的放弃书。
  3. 签署延长法定征收或追讨税款的法定时间期限。
  4. 签署结案书。


**签署您的纳税申报表。**
不允许委托书指定的代表签署您的所得税申报表，除非：
  1. 《国税法规》和相关条例（参见条例第 1.6012-1(a)(5) 条）允许签名；以及
  2. 您在您的委托书中就此作出特别授权。


例如，条例规定：如果您由于以下原因不能签署纳税申报表，允许代表为您签署：
  * 疾病或受伤。
  * 法律要求提交纳税申报表的日前之前，连续至少 60 天未在美国（包括波多黎各）。
  * 其他正当理由，条件是请求 IRS 的特定许可并且 IRS 作出特定许可。


代表签署纳税申报表时，该表必须随附授权代表签署该表的委托书（或副本）。若要了解详情，参见 表格 2848 的说明。
**对替代或委托的限制。**
只有在委托书中明确授权的情况下，认可代表才能将委托书项下的权限替代或委托给另一位认可代表。
替代完成后，只有新认可代表才被认可为纳税人的代表。如果完成权力委托，原代表和委托代表均被 IRS 认可为代表您。
**向第三方披露纳税申报表。**
您的代表不能签署允许 IRS 向第三方披露纳税申报表或其中信息的同意书，除非您在表格 2848 第 5a 行中将此权限委托给您的代表。
**无能力或不胜任。**
如果您变得无能力或不胜任，通常委托书终止。
如果您就表格 2848 第 5a 行“其他授权行为”作出授权， “以及” 如果您的非 IRS 永久 委托书符合 IRS 的全部接受要求，那么在您无能力或不胜任的情况下，委托书继续有效。参见后文 [_非 IRS 委托书_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148646 "非 IRS 委托书。")内容。
#### 何时需要委托书？
您想授权个人接收机密税收信息及在 IRS 代表您时，无论代表是否履行上文[ _“何为委托书”_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148637 "何为委托书？")引用的其他行为，您要提交委托书 。
您想授权其他人代表您履行以下至少一项行为时，最需要委托书。
  1. 代表您参加 IRS 会议。
  2. 填写和提交 IRS 调查的书面答复。


#### 必要表格
使用 IRS 表格 2848，任命认可代表代表您在 IRS 行事。在表格 2848 部分 II“代表声明”下列明 _在 IRS 代表_ 您的 认可个人。您的代表必须填写表格的该部分内容。
**非 IRS 委托书。**
IRS 接受非 IRS 委托书，但必须随附 填写完毕的表格 2848，从而将委托书录入 集中授权文件 (CAF) 系统。若要了解详情，参见后文 [_处理非 IRS 委托书_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148650 "处理非 IRS 委托书。")。
如果您想使用 表格 2848 以外的文件为代表授权，该文件中必须包含以下信息。
  * 您的姓名和邮寄地址。
  * 您的社会保险号码（或您的个人报税识别号码 (ITIN)）和/或雇主识别号。
  * 您的员工计划号码（如适用）。
  * 您的代表的姓名和邮寄地址。
  * 所涉及的税种。
  * 联邦税单号码。
  * 所涉及的具体年份或时期。
  * （关于遗产税事项）死者死亡日期。
  * 明确表达您对授予您的代理人的授权范围的意图。
  * 您的签名和日期。


您还必须在非 IRS 委托书上随附您的代表作出的已签字并注明日期的声明。该声明，称为“代表的声明”， 包含在表格 2848 部分 II 中。该声明内容如下：
  1. 本人当前未被停职，也未被取消在国税局执业、或本人未被其他机构禁止执业资格。
  2. 本人受修订版第 230 号通告（《美国联邦法规》第 31 编部分 10 子标题 A）中载明的条例的规限，该通告管辖在国税局代理纳税人的执业。
  3. 本人获得授权代表委托书中所列纳税人，以及
  4. 本人是一名（如表格 2848 第 II 部合格代表名单所列，指明从事代表服务所依据的身份）。


_**缺失必要信息。**_
如果您的非 IRS 委托书未列举上述所有信息， 则 IRS 不予接受。您可以在填写完毕的 表格 2848 或含有所有信息的全新非 IRS 委托书上签字，并将其提交。如果您不能签署可接受的替代文件，您的代理人可能会通过使用下文所述程序来完善（令 IRS 可接受）您的非 IRS 委托书。
_**完善非 IRS 委托书的程序。**_
根据以下条件，非 IRS 委托书中载明的代理人可以代表您 签署表格 2848。
  1. 原非 IRS 委托书作出处理联邦税收事项的授权（例如，履行任何行为的一般授权）。
  2. 代理人将声明（根据倘若作伪证受处罚的规定签字）附于 表格 2848。该声明说明，根据管辖司法管辖区的法律，原非 IRS 委托书有效。


**示例。**
纳税人 John Elm 签署一份非 IRS 委托书，指定其邻居及注册会计师 Ed Larch 担任其代理人。该委托书授权 Ed 代表 John 履行任何和所有行为。但是，其中未列出税收类型或纳税申报表号码等具体税收相关信息。
John 签署委托书之后不久，就被宣布不称职。后来，出现与 John 提交的上年纳税申报表相关的联邦税收事项。Ed 试图在 IRS 代表 John，但被驳回，因为永久授权未含必要信息。
如果 Ed 附上一份声明（根据倘若在作伪证受处罚的规定下签字），说明根据具有管辖权的司法管辖区的法律，该永久委托书有效；其能够签署填写完毕的表格 2848，并且已代表 John 提交该声明。如果 Ed 可以在 IRS 代理纳税人执业（参见前文 [_“谁可以在 IRS代理纳税人执业”），_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148595 "谁可以在 IRS 代理纳税人执业？")其可以在 表格 2848 上将自己指定为代表。否则，其必须指定可以在 IRS 代理纳税人执业的其他人。
_**处理非 IRS 委托书。**_
IRS 拥有名为 CAF 系统的集中计算机数据库系统。本系统含有关于纳税人代表权限的信息。通常，您向 IRS 提交委托书文件时，该文件就被予以处理，变为 CAF 系统的内容。在 CAF 系统中录入您的委托书，可以帮助没有您的委托书副本的 IRS 工作人员通过访问 CAF，来验证您的代表权限。如果您指定您的代表接收通知和其他 IRS 通讯，上述操作还可以帮助 IRS 自动向您的代表发送该等通讯。
您可以通过将您的非 IRS 委托书随附于 填写完毕的表格 2848 并将其提交 IRS，然后录入 CAF 系统。无需您签名；但是，您的代理人必须签署 _代表声明_ （参见 2848 部分 II ）。

#### 如何填写表格 2848？
以下示例说明如何填写 表格 2848。
**示例。**
Stan 和某 Mary 已被告知他们的 2014 年、2015 年和 2016 年共同所得税申报表 （表格 1040）正在接受审查。他们决定委任注册报税代理人 Jim Smith 代表他们处理此事以及与这些纳税申报表相关的未来事宜。Jim 已在同一地点填写纳税申报表多年，拥有分配给其的集中授权文件 (CAF) 号码。Mary 不想让 Jim 代签任何协议，而 Stan 却想让 Jim 这样做。Stan 和 Mary 也授权 Jim 使用中间服务提供商，来访问他们的 IRS 记录。他们希望将所有通知和书面通讯副本发送给 Jim。这是 Stan 和 Mary 首次向任何人授予委托书。他们应当分别填写 表格 2848 内容如下。
**Line 1—Taxpayer information. (第 1 行— 纳税人信息。)**
Stan 和 Mary 必须分别另行提交一份 表格 2848。Stan 在其单独的表格 2848 中，在所提供的空处输入其姓名、街道地址和社会保险号。Mary 在其单独的表格 2848 中也一一照做。
**Line 2—Representative(s). (第 2 行— 代表。)**
在 Stan 和 Mary 单独的表格 2848 中，二人分别输入其选择的代表 Jim Smith 的姓名和当前地址。Stan 和 Mary 想让 Jim Smith 接收第 3 行中确定事宜相关的通知和通讯，因此，在他们单独的表格 2848 中，二人分别勾选第 2 行第一栏中的选框。他们也输入 Smith 先生的 CAF 号码、他的报税人识别号 (PTIN)、电话号码和传真号码。IRS 发放 Smith 先生的 CAF 号码以来，其地址、电话号码和传真号码均未发生变更，因此，Stan 和 Mary 二人不勾选第二栏中的选框。
**Line 3—Acts authorized (Tax matters). (第 3 行 —授权行为（税收事项）。)**
在 Stan 和 Mary 单独的表格 2848 中，二人分别输入 “所得税” 事项描述、“1040” 表格编号，以及 “2014 年、2015 年和 2016 年” 纳税年度。
**Line 4—Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). (第 4 行 — 集中授权文件 (CAF) 未记录的具体用途。)**
在 Stan 和 Mary 单独的表格 2848 中，二人并未在此行输入任何内容，因为他们不想将委托书的用途限于 CAF 中未记录的特定用途。参见上文 [_填写表格 — 有用的提示_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148651 "填写表格 — 有用的提示")。
**Line 5—Additional acts authorized and restrictions. （第 5 行—授权的附加行为以及限制。）**
Mary 想签署任何协议，反映其与 Stan 在 2014 年、2015 年和 2016 年共同所得税责任变化情况，因此她在表格 2848 第 5b 行写道： “任何协议书都必须由纳税人签署” 。Stan 不想限制 Jim Smith 在这方面的权限，因此他将其表格 2848 第 5b 行留空。如果 Mary 或 Stan 作出选择，则他们本可以在其单独的表格 2848 第 5b 行列明其他限制。而且，Mary 和 Stan 均勾选 第 5 行上的“通过中间服务提供商访问本人的 IRS 记录”，允许 Jim 通过中间服务提供商访问他们的 IRS 记录。
**Line 6—Retention/revocation of prior power(s) of attorney. （第 6 行 — 保留/撤销先前委托书。）**
Stan 和 Mary 分别提交他们的首份委托书，所以二人未在本行输入任何内容。但是，如果他们已经提交先前委托书，则当前委托书将撤销先前关于相同税务事宜的委托书，除非他们勾选第 6 行上的选框，并附上他们希望继续有效的先前委托书副本。
如果 Mary 后来决定可以自己处理检查事宜，她可以撤销她的委托书，尽管 Stan 未撤销他的委托书。（参见上文 [_撤销委托书/撤回代表_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148663 "撤销委托书/撤回代表")，了解适用的特殊规则。）
**Line 7—Signature of taxpayer. （第 7 行 — 纳税人的签名。）**
Stan 和 Mary 分别签署表格 2848，并在其上注明日期。如果纳税人未签字，则 IRS 不能接收该表格。
**Part II—Declaration of Representative. （部分 II — 代表声明。）**
Jim Smith 必须填写 表格 2848 的本部分。如果他不签署本部分，则 IRS 不能接收该表格。
#### 委托书在提交后会发生什么情况？
IRS 收到、审查并确定委托书包含必要的信息后，方对该委托书予以认可。但是，在委托书输入 CAF 系统之前，IRS 工作人员不知道您指定代表您的人士的权限。因此，在此期间，IRS 工作人员会要求您或您的代表携带一份委托书副本参加 IRS 的任何会议。
#### 办理与处理
如何办理与处理委托书取决于委托是完整还是不完整的文件。
**不完整文件。**
如果表格 2848 不完整，IRS 将尝试通过向您或您的代表致函或致电，取得缺失信息。例如，如果您的签名或签名日期缺失，则 IRS 会联系您。如果您的代表相关的信息缺失，足以取得联系的信息在该文件上，则 IRS 将尝试联系您的代表。
在任何一种情况下，在该文件中输入所有必要信息前，委托书不视为有效。在该文件完整无缺并为 IRS 所接受前，IRS 不认可被指定为代表的个人代表您在 IRS 执业。
**完整文件。**
如果委托书完整有效，则 IRS 将采取行动认可该代表。大多数情况下，所采取的行动包括在 CAF 系统上处理文件。在 CAF 系统上记录数据帮助 将邮件副本直接发给授权代表，并随时认可授予的权限范围。
_**未在 CAF 上处理的文件。**_
不在 CAF 系统处理专用委托书（参见上文 [_填写表格 — 有用的提示_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zhs#zh-hans_201709_publink1000148651 "填写表格 — 有用的提示")。例如，不在 CAF 系统上处理一次性或特别签发的委托书。这些文件与相关档案一同存放。在此情况下，您应当勾选 表格 2848 第 4 行上的选框。这些情况下，代表应携带一份委托书副本参加 IRS 的每次会议。
#### 与代表打交道
在有效委托书提交后，IRS 将确认您的代表。但是，如果在反复请求后，代表没有提供非保密信息，该代表对不合理拖延或阻碍及时处理 IRS 事务负有责任，则 IRS 可以直接与您联系。例如，在委托书被认可的大多数情况下，IRS 会联系代表安排预约，并向其提供必要的项目清单。但是，如果代表不在，不回应反复请求，不提供必要的项目（除视为保密信息的项目以外），IRS 可以绕过您的代表直接与您联系。
如果代表人有上述行为，该事项可转介到职责办公室，考虑采取可能的纪律处分。
**通知和其他通信。**
如果您想授权您的代表接收 IRS 向您发出的所有通知和通讯副本，您必须勾选代表姓名和地址下提供的选框。**不超过两名代表可以接收 IRS 发给您的通知和通信副本。** 如果您不想通知和通讯副本发送给您的代表，请不要勾选此选框。
### 备注。
代表不接收通信有关的表格、刊物和其他相关材料。
