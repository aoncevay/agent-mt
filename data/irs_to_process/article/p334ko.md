## 자영업자입니까?
개인 사업자 또는 독립 계약자로서 거래 또는 사업을 영위하는 경우, 귀하는 자영업자입니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_자영업자이기 위해서 정기적으로 정규 사업 활동을 수행할 필요는 없습니다. 정규 업무 또는 사업 외에 시간제 사업을 하는 것은 자영업 일 수 있습니다._.
**거래 또는 사업.** 거래 또는 사업은 일반적으로 이익을 내기 위해 수행되는 활동입니다. 각 사례의 사실 관계와 정황에 따라 해당 활동이 거래 또는 사업인지 여부를 결정합니다. 이윤 동기가 있는 한 거래 또는 사업에 종사하기 위해 실제로 이익을 낼 필요가 없습니다. 사업의 이익을 증진시키기 위해 지속적인 노력을 기울여야 합니다.
**_유한책임회사 (LLC)._ ** LLC는 주 법률에 따라 조직 정관을 제출하여 형성된 설립체입니다. 일반적으로, 소득세 목적으론 단일 구성원 LLC는 소유주와 별개의 회사로 간주되지 않으며, 소유주의 연방 소득세 신고서에서 소득 및 공제를 신고합니다. 예를 들어, 단일 구성원 LLC가 농업에 종사하지 않고 소유주가 개인인 경우, 스케줄 C를 사용할 수 있습니다.
**개인 사업자.** 개인 사업자는 혼자서 비법인 사업체를 소유한 사람입니다. 또한, LLC를 법인으로 취급하지 않으며, 귀하가 개인이고 국내 LLC의 유일한 구성원인 경우 소득세 신고 목적으로 개인 사업자가 됩니다.
**독립 계약자.** 의사, 치과의사, 수의사, 변호사, 회계사, 도급업자, 하청업자, 공인중개사 또는 경매사와 같이 일반 대중에게 서비스를 제공하며 독립적인 영업, 사업 또는 직업에 종사하는 사람은 일반적으로 독립 계약자입니다. 그러나 독립 계약자인지 직원인지 여부는 각 사례의 사실 관계에 따라 달라집니다. 작업 비용을 지불하는 사람이 작업의 결과를 통제하거나 지시할 권리가 있지만 어떻게 수행될지 알 수 없는 경우 개인은 일반적인 규칙에 의해 독립 계약자가 됩니다. 독립 계약자로 일하는 사람의 수입은 자영업 세금의 대상이 됩니다. 직원 또는 독립 계약자 여부 결정에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 15-A, ‘고용주 보조 세금 가이드’를 참고하십시오.
## 법정 직원입니까?
법정 직원은 양식 W-2, ’임금 및 세금 내역서’의 박스 13번에 체크 표시가 있습니다. 법정 직원은 스케줄 C를 사용해 임금과 비용을 보고합니다.
## 배우자가 소유하고 운영하는 사업체
귀하와 배우자가 비법인 사업체를 공동으로 소유하고 운영하며 이익과 손실을 공유하는 경우, 공식 파트너쉽 계약 여부와 관계없이 파트너 관계에 있는 파트너입니다. 스케줄 C를 사용하지 않고, 대신 양식 1065, ‘미국 파트너쉽 소득 신고서’를 제출합니다. 자세한 내용은 간행물 541, ‘파트너쉽’을 참고하십시오.
**예외-부부 공동 소득.** 주, 외국 또는 미국의 부부 공동 재산 법률에 따라, 귀하와 배우자가 비법인 사업체를 공유 재산으로 완전히 소유하는 경우, 해당 사업체를 개인 사업자 또는 파트너쉽으로 취급할 수 있습니다. 부부 공동 재산법이 적용되는 주는 애리조나, 캘리포니아, 아이다호, 루이지애나, 네바다, 뉴멕시코, 텍사스, 워싱턴, 위스콘신 등입니다. 신고 위치의 변경은 회사의 전환으로 취급됩니다. 추후에, 간행물 555에서 부부 공동 재산법에 대한 자세한 내용을 확인하십시오.
**예외-적격 합작 사업 (QJV).** 귀하와 배우자가 공동으로 소유 및 운영하는 사업체의 유일한 구성원으로서 각각 실질적으로 참여하고 과세 연도에 대한 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하는 과세 연도에 대한 파트너쉽 대신 QJV로 취급되도록 공동 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 통해 양식 1065의 복잡성을 피할 수 있지만, 여전히 각 배우자에게 퇴직 수당의 기반이 되는 사회 보장 소득 적립 혜택을 제공합니다. "실질적 참여"에 대한 설명은 스케줄 C, (양식 1040), 라인 G에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_배우자가 공동 소유주이며 (주법인 명의가 아닌)로 소유하고 운영하는 사업체만 선택을 할 자격이 있습니다. 따라서, LLC를 통해 배우자가 소유 및 운영하는 사업은 QJV 선택 자격이 없습니다._.
이 선택을 하려면 사업에 대한 각자의 이익에 따라 귀하와 배우자 간에 사업체에 귀속되는 모든 소득, 이득, 손실, 공제 및 세액공제를 분배해야 합니다. 각각 별도의 스케줄 C와 별도의 스케줄 SE를 제출해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은, 스케줄 SE 지침에서 _적격 합작 사업_ 을 참고하십시오.

#### 식별 번호
이 항목에서는 TIN의 세 가지 유형, 필요한 사람, 사용 시기 및 취득 방법에 대해 설명합니다.
**사회 보장 번호 (SSN).**
일반적으로 SSN을 TIN으로 사용합니다. 양식 1040 및 양식의 스케줄과 같은 개인 소득세 양식에 이 번호를 입력해야 합니다.
사회보장번호 (SSN)를 신청하려면, **양식 SS-5** , ‘사회 보장 카드 신청서’를 사용합니다. 이 양식은 사회 보장국 (SSA) 사무실에서 제공되며 800-772-1213으로 전화해서 받을 수 있습니다. SSA 웹사이트 [SSA.gov/forms/ss-5(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov)에서도 받을 수 있습니다. 
**개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN).**
귀하가 비거주 또는 거주 외국인이며 SSN를 소지하지 않았거나 발급 받을 자격이 없는 경우 IRS는 ITIN을 발급합니다. ITIN은 3년 연속으로 연방 소득 신고서를 제출하지 않거나 다른 납세자의 신고서에 부양가족으로 포함되지 않은 납세자에 대해 만료됩니다. 일반적으로 ITIN을 취득해야 하는 경우, **양식 W-7** , ‘IRS 개인 납세자 식별 번호 신청서’를 귀하의 서명과 함께 작성한 원본 세금 신고서 및 기타 필요한 서류를 첨부해 양식 W-7 지침에 나와있는 주소로 우편 발송합니다. 예외 사항은 지침에서 다룹니다. 다른 사람의 SSN을 신고서에 포함해야 하지만, 그 사람이 SSN을 가지고 있지 않거나 발급받을 수 없는 경우 그 사람의 ITIN을 입력합니다. 이 신청서는 스페인어로도 이용할 수 있습니다. 이 양식은 [IRS.gov/FormW7](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7)에 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_ITIN은 세금 전용입니다. 사회 보장 혜택을 받거나 보유자의 고용 또는 이민 신분을 변경할 수 있는 자격을 부여하지 않습니다._.
**고용주 식별 번호 (EIN).**
다음 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 TIN으로 사용할 수 있는 EIN이 있어야 합니다. 
  * 한 명 이상의 직원에게 임금을 지급합니다.
  * 연금 또는 특별소비세 신고서를 제출합니다.


EIN이 반드시 있어야 하는 경우, 지침대로 SSN과 함께 스케줄 C에 기입합니다.
EIN을 신청하는 방법:
  * 온라인, [IRS.gov/businesses/small](https://www.irs.gov/ko/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed)에서 고용주 ID 번호 (EIN) 링크를 클릭합니다. 주요 사업장이 미국 또는 미국 영토에 위치한 경우, 신청 정보가 검증되면 즉시 EIN이 발급됩니다. 
  * 전화, **오직** 주요 사업장이 미국 또는 미국 영토 외부에 있을 때만 267-941-1099 (수신자 부담 전화 아님), 또는
  * **양식 SS-4** ,’ 고용주 식별 번호 신청서’를 우편 우송 또는 팩스를 통해.


_**새로운 EIN.**_
사업 구조 또는 소유권이 변경되는 경우 새 EIN을 받아야 할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 간행물 1635, ‘EIN 이해하기’를 참고하십시오. 
**다른 사람의 식별 번호가 필요한 경우.**
사업을 운영할 때 정보 신고서에 신고해야 하는 특정 지불금이 발생할 수 있습니다. 이 지불금은 나중에 이 장의 [_정보 신고서_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313217 "정보 신고서")에서 논의합니다. 이 지불금의 수취인 (수령인)에게 한 해 동안 지급된 총금액을 보여주는 내역서를 제공해야 합니다. 신고 및 내역서에 수취인의 식별 번호와 귀하의 식별 번호를 포함해야 합니다.
_**직원.**_
직원을 고용하고 있는 경우, 각 직원의 SSN을 반드시 받아야 합니다. 각 직원의 이름과 SSN을 직원의 사회 보장 카드에 표시된 대로 정확하게 기록하십시오. 직원의 이름이 카드에 표시된 것과 일치하지 않는 경우 직원은 SSA에서 새 카드를 요청해야 합니다. 결혼이나 이혼으로 인해 직원의 이름이 변경된 경우 발생할 수 있습니다.
직원 원천징수 허용 증명서인 양식 W-4는 각 직원이 작성하여 올바른 연방 소득세를 급여에서 원천징수할 수 있습니다.
직원이 SSN가 없는 경우, SSA에 SS-5 양식을 제출해야 합니다.
_**기타 수취인.**_
직원이 아닌 다른 사람에게 대금을 지불하고 정보 신고서에 대금을 신고해야 하는 경우, 그 사람의 SSN을 확보해야 합니다. 법인이나 파트너쉽과 같은 조직에 지불한 대금을 신고해야 하는 경우 EIN을 받아야 합니다. 
수취인의 SSN 또는 EIN을 받으려면 **양식 W-9** , ‘납세자 식별 번호 및 인증 요청’을 사용합니다. 
식별 번호를 제공하지 않는 수취인은 예비 원천징수 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 예비 원천징수에 대한 자세한 내용은 양식 W-9 요청자에 대한 지침 및 특정 정보 신고서에 대한 일반 지침을 참고하십시오. 
#### 소득세
이 파트에서는 귀하의 소득세 신고서 제출 의무 여부와 제출 시기에 대해 설명합니다. 세금을 납부 방법에 대해서도 설명합니다.
#### 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니까?
자영업의 순수입이 $400 이상인 경우 2024년 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 자영업의 순수입이 $400 미만인 경우에도, 양식 1040의 지침에 명시된 기타 신고 요건을 충족한다면 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니다.
#### 어떻게 신고해야 합니까?
소득세 신고서를 제출할 때, **양식 1040** 또는 **양식 1040-SR** 을 사용하고 **스케줄 C** 를 첨부하십시오. 순이익 또는 순손실을 스케줄 C, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040)에 기입하십시오. 사업으로 인한 순이익 또는 손실을 파악하기 위해, 스케줄 C를 사용합니다. 개인 사업자로서 2개 이상의 사업체를 운영하였을 경우, 별도의 각 사업별 스케줄 C를 제출해야 합니다.

IRS 전자 신고 로고
**IRS 전자 신고 로고**
요약: 이것은 IRS 전자 파일 프로그램을 식별하는 데 사용되는 로고의 예시입니다.
[Please click here for the text description of the image.](https://www.irs.gov/media/167481)
전자 세금 신고서를 제출하기 위해 IRS _전자 신고_ 옵션을 사용할 수 있습니다. [표 1-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313188 "표 1-1. IRS 전자 신고의 이점           ")에는 IRS _전자 신고_ 의 이점이 나열되어 있습니다. IRS _전자 신고_ 는 자동화를 사용하여 서면 신고서를 처리하는 데 필요한 대부분의 수동 단계를 대체합니다. 그 결과, 전자 신고를 통한 신고서의 처리는 서면 신고서를 사용했을 때보다 더 빠르고 정확합니다. 서면 신고서와 마찬가지로, 신고서에 정확한 정보가 포함되고 제때 제출되었는지 확인할 책임은 본인에게 있습니다. 
귀하가 _전자 신고_ 를 사용하는 것은 IRS의 신고서의 세무조사 가능성에 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
가장 일반적으로 사용되는 사업 양식을 신고하기 위해 _전자 신고_ 를 사용할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov](https://www.IRS.gov/ko)에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
**전자 서명.**
비서면 신고는 생각보다 쉬우며, 2024년 말에 만 16세 이상의 최초 납세자를 비롯한 전자 신고를 하는 대부분의 납세자가 이용할 수 있습니다. 세무 소프트웨어 또는 세무 전문가를 통해 전자적으로 제출하는 경우, 신고서에 서명할 때 자체 선택 PIN (개인 식별 번호) 방법을 _전자 신고_ 에서 사용하게 됩니다. 부부 공동 신고의 경우, 귀하와 배우자는 각각 PIN을 생성하고 이 PIN을 전자 서명으로 입력해야 합니다.
PIN을 생성하려면 원래 제출된 2023년 소득세 신고서의 조정총소득 (AGI)을 알아야 합니다 (수정된 신고서, 양식 1040-X 또는 IRS로부터 산술 오류 통지를 받은 후 제외). 생년월일 (DOB)도 제공해야 합니다. DOB가 정확하고 SSA와 기록한 정보가 일치하는지 _전자 신고_ 를 하기 전에 확인하십시오. 그러기 위해 연례 사회보장 내역서를 확인하십시오.
자체 선택 PIN을 사용하면 서명할 필요가 없고 우편으로 보낼 것도 없습니다. 양식 W-2도 마찬가지입니다. 자체 선택 PIN에 대한 자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov](https://www.IRS.gov/ko)에서 확인하십시오.
**주 신고서.**
대부분의 주에서는 연방 신고서와 동시에 전자로 주 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 주 세무 본기관, 세무 전문가 또는 [IRS.gov](https://www.IRS.gov/ko)에서 확인하십시오.
**환급.**
환급 수표를 우편으로 보내거나 환급금을 당좌 또는 저축 계좌로 직접 입금할 수 있습니다. 
IRS의 _전자 신고_ 를 사용하면, 귀하의 환급 처리는 서면으로 제출했을 때와 비교해 절반의 시간이 소요됩니다. 21일 이내에 대부분의 환급이 처리됩니다.
_**채무에 대한 상계.**_
서면 신고서와 마찬가지로, 귀하에게(또는 귀하의 배우자, 공동 신고서를 제출한다면) 연방세, 주정부세, 학자금 대출, 자녀 양육비 등 과거 연체된 금액이 있는 경우, 환급액을 전부 받지 못할 수 있습니다. 청구한 환급이 채무에 대해 상계된 경우 통보를 받을 것입니다. 배우자의 개별 채무를 납부하기 위해 이체된 공동 환급금의 일부 또는 전액의 회수를 위해 양식 8379, ‘피해 배우자의 지분’ 또는 양식 8857, ‘무고한 배우자 구제 요청서’를 통해 피해 배우자 청구서를 제출할 수 있습니다.
**환급 관련 문의.**
환급 현황은 적어도 신고서를 제출한 날로부터 24시간 (서면 신고서를 우편으로 보낸 경우 4주)이 경과된 후 확인할 수 있습니다. 납세자 구분, 신고서에 표시된 첫 번째 SSN, 정확한 환급 금액 전액을 알아야 하므로 세금 신고서 사본을 준비해야 합니다. 환급을 확인하려면 다음 중 하나를 수행하십시오.
  * [IRS.gov/Refunds](https://www.irs.gov/ko/refunds)을 방문하십시오.
  * 스마트폰에 무료 IRS2Go 앱을 다운로드하여 환급 상태를 확인하십시오.
  * 연락처 800-829-1954로 전화하여 자동 환불 정보를 확인하고 기록된 지침을 따르십시오.


IRS는 근로 소득 세액공제나 추가 자녀 세액 세액공제를 청구한 신고서에 대해 2025년 2월 중순 이전에 환급할 수 없습니다. 이 세액공제와 관련된 부분뿐만 아니라 전체 환급에 적용됩니다.
**미납액.**
신고서에 세금 납부 기한이 명시되어 있는 경우, 신고 마감일 (신고 마감일 연장 여부와 관계없이)까지 납부해야 연체금 과징금과 이자를 피할 수 있습니다. 2024년 역년의 경우 2025년 4월 15일까지 납부합니다. 당좌 또는 저축 계좌에서 또는 신용카드에서 전자 자금 인출을 예약하는 등 다양한 결제 방법을 선택할 수 있습니다. 납부 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은, [IRS.gov/Payments](https://www.irs.gov/ko/payments)에서 확인하십시오.
#### 공인 IRS _전자 신고_ 제공업체 이용
많은 세무 전문가들이 전자 방식으로 고객을 대신해 무서면 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 두 가지 방법이 있습니다.
  1. 신고서를 작성하여 공인 IRS _전자 신고_ 제공업체에게 가져가서 전자적으로 IRS에 전송하도록 할 수 있습니다.
  2. 공인 IRS _전자 신고_ 제공업자가 신고서를 작성하고 전자 방식으로 전송하도록 할 수 있습니다.


신고 시 제공업자에게 자체 선택 PIN을 입력할 수 있는 권한을 부여하기 위해, 양식 8879, ‘IRS _전자 신고_ 서명 인증’을 완료하라는 메시지가 표시됩니다.
제공업자와 요청된 특정 서비스에 따라 수수료가 청구될 수 있습니다. 가까운 곳에서 공인 IRS _전자 신고_ 제공업체를 찾으려면, [IRS.gov/Efile/Providers(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/e-file-providers/authorized-irs-e-file-provider-locator-service-for-tax-professionals)를 방문하십시오.
#### 개인 컴퓨터 사용
인터넷에 접속할 수 있는 컴퓨터만 있으면, 세금 신고서를 제출할 때 IRS 전자 신고를 사용할 수 있습니다. 개인 컴퓨터를 사용한다면, 낮이든 밤이든 거주지에서 _전자 신고_ 로 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 신고서에 전자 서명하고 선택한 PIN을 사용하여 신고 절차를 완료합니다. 제출할 서명 양식이나 발송할 W-2 양식이 없습니다.
**세금 신고서 작성을 위한 무료 소프트웨어.**
2024년 AGI가 $84,000 이하인 경우 무료 세금 소프트웨어를 사용하여 _전자 신고_ 로 세금 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다.
_**Free File.**_
IRS과 세무 소프트웨어 제공업체 간의 이 정부-민간 파트너쉽으로 여러 개의 유명 브랜드 상용 소프트웨어 제품과 _전자 신고_ 를 무료로 사용할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov/FreeFile](https://www.irs.gov/ko/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)을 참고하십시오. 각 소프트웨어 제공업체의 무료 사용 기준을 검토하거나 온라인 도구를 사용하여 상황에 맞는 무료 소프트웨어 제품을 찾을 수 있습니다. 일부 소프트웨어 제공업체는 주 세금 신고서를 무료로 제공합니다.
_**Free File Fillable Forms.**_
IRS는 전자 버전의 IRS 서면 양식을 제공하며, 이 또한 _전자 신고_ 를 무료로 이용할 수 있습니다. 무료 신고 기입가능 양식 (Free File Fillable Form)은 세금 신고서를 직접 작성해 본 경험이 있는 사람에게 가장 적합합니다. 이러한 양식을 사용하는 데 소득 제한이 없습니다. Free File Fillable Forms 는 기본적인 수학 계산을 수행합니다. 연방 세금 양식만 지원합니다.
#### 고용주 및 금융 기관을 통한 제출
일부 사업체는 무료 _전자 신고_ 를 직원, 구성원 또는 고객에게 제공합니다. 다른 회사들은 유료로 제공합니다. 고용주 또는 금융 기관에 IRS _전자 신고_ 를 직원, 구성원 또는 고객 혜택으로 제공하는지 물어보십시오.
#### 신고서 무료 지원
IRS에서 훈련받은 자원봉사자가 신고서를 작성하는 데 있어 전국적으로 무료 도움을 드릴 수 있습니다. 자원봉사 소득세 지원 (VITA) 프로그램은 저소득 납세자를 돕기 위해 고안되었으며, 고령자를 위한 세무 상담 (TCE) 프로그램은 만 60세 이상의 납세자의 세금 신고서의 지원을 위해 고안되었습니다. 일부 사무소에서는 무료 전자 신고를 제공합니다.

#### 세금 신고서 마감일은 언제입니까?
2024년 역년의 경우, 양식 1040 혹은 1040-SR은 2025년 4월 15일이 마감일입니다. 회계 연도를 사용하는 경우 (2장에서 설명), 신고서 제출은 회계 연도 종료 후 4번째 달의 15일까지입니다. 늦게 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 과징금과 이자를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다.
제때 신고서를 제출할 수 없는 경우 **양식 4868** , ‘미국 개인 소득세 신고서 제출 자동 연장 신청서’를 사용하여 자동 6개월 연장을 요청하십시오. 역년 납세자의 경우 신고서 제출 기한이 10월 15일까지 연장됩니다. 연장 신청은 세금 납부 기간을 연장하는 것이 아니라 세금 신고 기간만 연장하는 것입니다.
#### 소득세는 어떻게 납부해야 합니까?
연방 소득세는 원천 징수하는 세금입니다. 한 해 동안 수입을 올리거나 소득을 받을 때 지불해야 합니다. 직원은 일반적으로 급여에서 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 원천징수를 통해 세금을 납부하지 않거나 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않으면 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다.
**추정세 납부.**
신고서를 제출할때 자영업세 포함 $1,000 이상 납부할 것으로 예상되는 경우 일반적으로 추정세를 납부해야합니다 (나중에 논의). **양식 1040-ES** 를 사용하여 세금을 산정하고 납부합니다. 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 신고할 때 납부해야 할 세금을 납부할 수 있습니다. 추정세에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 505를 참고하십시오.
_**추정세를 납부할 수 있는 옵션들은 무엇입니까?**_
다양한 방법을 사용하여 전자적으로 추정세를 납부할 수 있습니다. 전자 결제를 하는 경우 양식 1040-ES 납부 전표를 우편으로 보낼 필요가 없습니다. 다음과 같은 방법이 있습니다.
  1. 전자 연방 세금 납부 시스템 (EFTPS)을 통한 전자 납부,
  2. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 전자적으로 제출할 때 전자 자금 인출을 승인하여 직접 납부, 또는
  3. 전화 또는 인터넷을 통해 신용카드 또는 직불카드로 납부.


다른 방법으로는 2023년 신고서상의 과다납부액을 2024년 추정세로 적용하거나 양식 1040-ES의 납부 전표를 수표나 머니 오더와 함께 발송하는 방법이 있습니다.
_**EFTPS.**_
  1. EFTPS에 등록하려면, [EFTPS.gov(영어)](https://www.eftps.gov)을 방문거나 800-555-4477로 전화하십시오.
  2. 새로운 EIN을 요청하면 자동으로 EFTPS에 등록할 수 있습니다.
  3. EFTPS의 장점은 다음과 같습니다.
    1. 결제 시 오류가 발생할 가능성이 줄어듭니다.
    2. 모든 거래에 대한 즉각적인 확인서를 받게 됩니다.


**세금 과소납부에 대한 과징금.**
원천 징수 또는 추정세 납부를 통해 2024년 소득세 및 자영업 세금을 충분히 납부하지 않은 경우, 납부하지 않은 금액에 대한 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. IRS가 과징금을 계산하고 청구서를 보낼 것입니다. 또는, **양식 2210** , ‘개인, 유산 및 신탁의 추정세 과소 납부’를 사용하여 과징금을 납부해야하는지 확인하고 과징금 액수를 파악합니다. 자세한 내용은 간행물 505를 참고하십시오. 
#### 자영업 (SE) 세금
SE 세금은 주로 자신을 위해 일하는 개인을 위한 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금입니다. 대부분의 임금 소득자 급여에서 원천 징수되는 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금과 유사합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_법정 직원으로 소득을 올린 경우 해당 소득에 대해 SE 세금을 납부하지 않습니다. 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금은 해당 수입에서 이미 원천 징수되었어야 합니다._.
**사회 보장 범위.**
사회 보장 혜택은 임금을 버는 사람들 처럼 자영업자에게도 혜택이 있습니다. SE 세금 납부액은 사회 보장 플랜에 따라 귀하의 보장 범위에 기여합니다. 사회 보장은 퇴직 수당, 장애 수당, 생존자 수당 및 병원 보험 (메디케어) 수당을 제공합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_자영업 소득을 모두 신고해야 합니다. 모든 금액을 신고하지 않으면 은퇴할 때 사회 보장 혜택이 낮아질 수 있습니다._.
_**사회 보장 적용되게 하는 방법.**_
사회 보장 혜택을 받기 전에 사회 보장 체제에 따라 보험에 가입해야 합니다. 필수 크레딧 (또는 가입 분기) 수를 보유한 경우 보험에 가입되며, 나중에 논의됩니다. 
_**2024년 및 2025년 소득 적립.**_
2024년에는 사회 보장세 대상 소득이 $1,730 (2025년 기준 $1,810)일 때 1 크레딧을 받고, 최대 4 크레딧까지 받을 수 있습니다. 따라서 2024년에 사회 보장세 대상 소득 (자영업 및 임금)이 $6,920인 경우 4 크레딧 (6,920÷1,730)을 받은 것입니다. 
귀하가 보장을 받기 위해 보유해야 하는 크레딧 갯수와 사회 보장 프로그램에 따라 귀하와 귀하의 가족에게 제공되는 혜택에 대한 설명은 가까운 SSA 사무소에 문의하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_사회 보장 혜택을 받기 위해 또는 더 많은 혜택을 받기 위해 허위 진술을 하는 경우 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다._.
**자영업 소득 SSA 통지 기한.**
일반적으로, SSA는 귀하가 소득을 얻은 과세 연도로부터 3년, 3개월, 그리고 15일 이내에 제출된 세금 신고서에 신고된 자영업 소득에 대한 적립을 제공합니다. 이 기한 이후에 세금 신고서를 제출하거나 자영업 소득의 변경 사항을 신고하는 경우, SSA는 기록을 변경할 수 있지만, 해당 금액을 삭제하거나 줄일 수만 있습니다. SSA는 귀하의 자영업 소득을 늘리기 위해 기록을 변경하지 않습니다. 
**SE 세금을 반드시 납부해야 하는 사람.**
다음 중 해당 사항이 있다면, SE 세금을 납부하고 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 제출해야 합니다. 
  1. 자영업 순수입 (교회 직원 소득 제외)이 $400 이상인 경우.
  2. 교회 직원 소득이 $108.28 이상인 경우. 


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_SE 세금 규정은 귀하의 나이 및 이미 사회 보장 또는 메디케어 혜택을 받고 있지 여부에 관계없이 적용됩니다._.
**SE 세율.**
순수입에 대한 SE 세율은 15.3% (사회 보장세 12.4% + 메디케어세 2.9%)입니다. 
**SE세 과세 대상 최대 소득**
2024년 임금, 팁 및 순수입을 모두 합한 금액 중 오직 첫 $168,600 까지만 SE 세금의 사회 보장 부분 12.4%, 사회보장세 또는 철도 퇴직세 1등급의 과세 대상입니다.
2024년의 임금, 팁 및 순이익을 모두 합한 금액은 SE 세금의 2.9% 메디케어 부분, 메디케어 세금 또는 철도 퇴직 세금의 메디케어 부분의 과세 대상입니다.
직원으로서 받는 임금과 팁이 사회보장세 또는 철도 퇴직세의 1단계 부분 또는 둘 다의 적용을 받고 총액이 $168,600 이상인 경우, 순이익에 대한 SE 세금의 12.4% 사회 보장 부분을 납부하지 않습니다. 단, 모든 순이익에 대해 SE 세금의 메디케어 부분 2.9%는 납부해야합니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_SE 세금의 2분의 1을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 15의 소득에 대한 조정으로 공제하십시오._ .
**추가 메디케어 세금.**
자영업 순수입이 다음 임계값 금액 중 하나를 초과하는 경우 0.9%의 추가 메디케어 세금이 적용될 수 있습니다 (납세자 구분에 따라 다름).
  * 부부 공동 신고—$250,000
  * 부부 개별 신고—$125,000
  * 미혼, 세대주 또는 적격 생존 배우자— $200,000


임금과 자영업 소득이 모두 있는 경우, 자영업 소득에 추가 메디케어 세금을 적용하는 임계값 금액은 추가 메디케어 세금을 적용받는 임금 금액만큼 감소합니다 (0 미만은 될 수 없음). 이 세금을 계산하기 위해, 양식 8959, ‘추가 메디케어 세금’을 사용합니다.
**추가 정보.**
SE 세금 계산 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 [10장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313597 "자영업 \(SE\) 세금")을 참고하십시오.

## 2. 회계 기간 및 회계 방식
#### 소개
과세 대상 소득을 파악하고 연간 회계 연도 (과세 연도)에 대한 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 또한 과세 연도에 대한 소득과 지출을 명확하게 보여주는 회계 방식을 일관되게 사용해야 합니다.
#### 유용한 항목 - 다음을 보십시오.
**간행물**
  * 538 회계 기간 및 회계 방식


[12장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313668 "추가 정보를 얻는 방법")에서 간행물과 양식을 얻는 방법에 대한 정보를 참고하십시오.
#### 회계 기간
손익계산서 (일반적으로, 소득세 신고서)를 작성할 때는 회계 기간이라는 특정 기간 동안 장부와 기록을 사용해야 합니다. 소득세 신고서에 대한 연간 회계 기간을 **과세 연도** 라고 합니다. 다음 과세 연도 중 하나를 사용할 수 있습니다.
  * 역년 과세 연도.
  * 회계 과세 연도.


필수적으로 사용해야 하는 과세 연도가 없는 한, 해당 과세 연도를 사용하여 첫 번째 소득세 신고서를 제출하여 과세 연도를 채택합니다. 필수 과세 연도는 국세법 또는 소득세 규정에 따라 요구되는 과세 연도입니다. 
**역년 과세 연도.**
역년 과세 연도는 1월 1일에 시작해서 12월 31일에 끝나는 연속적인 12개월입니다.
다음 중 하나라도 해당하는 경우, 역년 과세 연도를 채택해야 합니다. 
  * 회계 장부를 기입하지 않은 경우.
  * 연간 회계 기간이 없는 경우.
  * 현재 과세 연도는 회계 연도에 적격하지 않은 경우.
  * 국세법 또는 소득세 규정에 따라 역년 과세 연도를 사용이 요구되는 경우.


역년 과세 연도를 사용하여 첫 소득세 신고서를 제출하고 나중에 개인 사업자로 사업을 시작한 경우, IRS에서 변경 승인을 받거나 IRS 승인 없이 변경할 수가 없다면 역년 과세 연도를 계속 사용해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은, 추후의 [_과세 연도 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313232 "과세 연도 변경.")을 보십시오. 
역년 과세 연도를 채택하는 경우 장부와 기록을 유지하고 매년 1월 1일부터 12월 31일까지의 소득과 지출을 신고해야 합니다. 
**회계 과세 연도.**
회계 과세 연도는 12월을 제외한 달의 마지막 날에 종료되는 연속적인 12개월입니다. 52~53주 과세 연도는 52주에서 53주까지 차이가 있지만 한 달의 마지막 날에 종료할 필요는 없는 회계 연도입니다.
회계 연도를 채택하는 경우 장부 및 기록을 유지하고 같은 과세 연도를 사용하여 소득 및 지출을 신고해야 합니다.
52~53주 과세 연도를 포함한 회계 연도에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 538을 참고하십시오.
**과세 연도 변경.**
일반적으로, **양식 1128** , ‘과세 연도 채택, 변경 또는 유지 신청서’를 제출하여 과세 연도 변경에 대한 IRS 승인을 요청합니다. 예외 사항은 양식 1128의 지침을 참고하십시오. 자동 승인 요청 자격을 충족하는 경우, 사용자 수수료가 요구되지 않습니다. 자동 승인을 받을 자격이 없는 경우 판정을 요청해야 합니다. 판정을 요청하는 경우, 사용자 수수료에 대한 자세한 내용은 양식 1128을 참고하십시오.
#### 회계 방식
회계 방식은 소득과 비용을 신고하는 시기와 방법을 결정하는 데 사용되는 일련의 규칙입니다. 귀하의 회계 방식에는 귀하가 사용하는 전체 회계 방식뿐만 아니라 모든 중요 항목에 대해 귀하가 사용하는 회계 처리도 포함됩니다.
사업용 스케줄 C가 포함된 첫 번째 소득세 신고서를 제출할 때 사업 회계 방식을 선택합니다. 그 후, 회계 방식을 변경하려면 일반적으로 IRS의 승인을 받아야 합니다. 나중에 [_회계 방식 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313285 "회계 방식 변경")을 참고하십시오.
**방식의 종류.**
일반적으로, 다음 회계 방식을 사용할 수 있습니다. 
  * 현금주의 방식.
  * 발생기준 방식.
  * 특정 소득과 비용 항목에 대한 특별 회계 방식.
  * 위의 요소 중 둘 이상을 사용하는 조합 방식. 


과세 대상 소득을 파악하고 장부를 기장려면 동일한 회계 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 또한 소득을 명확하게 나타내는 회계 방식을 사용해야 합니다.
**사업 및 개인 품목.**
사업 항목과 개인 품목을 다른 회계 방식으로 상계할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 현금 방식을 사용하여 개인 품목을 상계하는 경우에도 발생기준 방식으로 사업 소득을 계산할 수 있습니다. 
**두개 이상의 사업체.**
두 개 이상의 개별 사업체를 보유한 경우 사업체별 소득이 명확하게 반영된다면 각각에 대해 다른 회계 방식을 사용할 수 있습니다. 각 사업체에 대한 장부와 기록을 완벽하게 별도로 관리된 경우에만, 분리 및 구별된 것입니다. 
#### 현금 방식
대부분의 개인 및 재고자산이 없는 많은 개인 사업자는 현금 방식을 사용합니다. 현금 방식 기록을 보관하는 것이 더 쉽기 때문입니다. 그러나 소득을 계산하기 위해 재고자산이 필요한 경우, 소규모 사업체 납세자가 아니라면 (이 장 후반에서 정의), 일반적으로 판매 및 구매에 대해 발생기준 회계 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은, 나중에 [_재고자산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313270 "재고자산")을 참고하십시오.
#### 소득
현금 방식 하에서는 과세 연도 동안 실제로 또는 건설적으로 수령한 모든 소득 항목을 귀하의 총소득에 포함합니다. 자산이나 서비스를 받는 경우, 그 공정한 시장 가치를 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**예시.**
2023년 12월 30일, 귀하의 고객은 귀하가 제공한 인테리어 장식 서비스에 대한 수표를 귀하에게 보냈습니다. 귀하는 2024년 1월 4일에 수표를 수령했습니다. 수표 금액을 2024년 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
**건설적 수령.**
귀하의 계좌에 금액이 입금되거나 제한 없이 귀하에게 제공되는 경우 귀하는 건설적으로 소득을 수령한 것입니다. 귀하는 이 소득을 소유하고 있을 필요가 없습니다. 대리인을 통해 소득을 수령하는 것을 승인하는 경우, 대리인이 소득을 수령했을 때 귀하가 수령한 것으로 간주합니다. 
**예시.**
이자가 2024년 12월에 은행 계좌에 입금되었습니다. 귀하는 2025년이 될 때까지 이를 인출하거나 장부에 기입하지 않았습니다. 귀하는 이 금액을 2024년 총소득에 포함해야 합니다.
_**소득 수령 지연.**_
소득에 대한 세금 납부를 피하기 위해 수표를 보유하거나 한 과세 연도에서 다른 과세 연도로 유사한 자산 취득을 연기할 수 없습니다. 귀하는 자산을 수령하거나 이를 제한 없이 이용할 수 있게 된 연도의 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 
**예시.**
서비스 계약자는 2024년 12월에 계약에 대해 $10,000의 지급금을 받을 자격이 있었습니다. 그들은 12월에 지급이 가능하다고 들었습니다. 그들의 요청으로, 2025년 1월이 될 때까지 급여를 지급받지 않았습니다. 이 지급금은 2024년에 건설적으로 수령했기 때문에 2024년 소득에 포함되어야 합니다.
_**수표.**_
과세 연도 말까지 유효한 수표의 수령하는 것은, 수표를 현금화하거나 예치할 수 없더라도 그 해에 소득을 건설적으로 수령한 것입니다. 
**예시.**
2024년 12월 31일에 귀하는 고객으로부터 $500의 수표를 받았습니다. 귀하는 2025년 1월3일까지 수표를 사업 계좌에 입금할 수 없습니다. 귀하는 2024년 소득에 이 수수료를 반드시 포함해야 합니다.
_**다른 사람이 변제했거나 취소된 채무.**_
귀하의 채무를 다른 사람이 변제했거나 채권자가 취소하는 경우, 이 채무 감면의 일부 또는 전부를 소득으로 신고해야 할 수 있습니다. 이러한 방식으로 소득이 발생하는 경우, 채무가 취소되거나 지불될 때 건설적으로 소득을 수령하게 됩니다. 자세한 내용은 _5장의 소득 종류_ 에서 [_취소된 채무_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313375 "취소된 채무")를 참고하십시오.
**소득 반환.**
금액을 소득에 포함시켰으며 나중에 그 전체 또는 일부를 반환해야 하는 경우, 일반적으로 반환을 한 연도에 반환금을 공제할 수 있습니다. 반환 금액이 $3,000 이상인 경우 특별 규정이 적용됩니다. 특별 규칙에 대한 자세한 내용은 _반환금_ 을 간행물 17의 8장에서 참고하십시오.
#### 비용
현금 방식에서는 일반적으로 과세 연도에 실제로 지불한 비용을 공제합니다. 여기에는 귀하가 책임 문제를 제기할 수 있는 사업 비용도 포함됩니다. 그러나 선급 비용을 공제할 수 없거나 특정 비용을 자본화해야 할 수도 있습니다. 이는 나중에 [_통일 자본화 규칙_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313280 "통일 자본화 규칙")에서 설명합니다.
**선불한 비용.**
비용이 해당되는 연도에만 미리 지급했던 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다.
**예.**
귀하는 역년 납세자로, 2024년 7월 1일부터 1년간 적용되는 사업 보험 증서에 대해 $1,000를 납부합니다. 2024년에 $500, 2025년에 $500를 공제할 수 있습니다. 
#### 발생기준 방식
발생기준 회계 방식에 따라 일반적으로 소득 연도의 소득을 신고하고 발생 연도의 비용을 공제하거나 자본화합니다. 발생기준 회계 방식의 목적은 수입과 지출을 올바른 해에 일치시키는 것입니다.
#### 소득—일반 규칙
발생기준 방식에서는 소득을 수령할 권리를 고정하는 모든 사건이 발생했으며 합리적인 정확도로 이 금액을 결정할 수 있는 과세 연도의 총소득에 일반적으로 이 금액을 포함시킵니다. 재무부 장관이 명시하는 해당 재무제표 또는 기타 재무제표를 가진 납세자의 경우, 총소득 항목에 대한 모든 사건 테스트는 적용 가능한 재무제표 또는 기타 재무제표에 반영되기 전까지는 충족된 것으로 간주됩니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 역년 발생기준 방식 납세자입니다. 귀하는 2024년 12월 28일에 컴퓨터를 판매했습니다. 2025년 1월 첫 주에 고객에게 청구했지만 2025년 2월이 될 때까지 결제 대금을 받지 못했습니다. 컴퓨터에 대해 수령한 금액을 2024년 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
#### 소득—특별 규칙
다음은 선급금, 예상 수입 및 서비스에 대한 지급 일정 변경에 적용되는 특별 규칙입니다.
**예상 수입.**
총소득에 합리적으로 추정된 금액을 포함한뒤 나중에 정확한 금액이 다르다고 판단하는 경우, 결정한 과세 연도에 해당 차액을 고려하십시오. 
**서비스에 대한 지급 일정 변경.**
계약에 명시된 기본 요율로 서비스를 수행하는 경우, 더 낮은 요율로 지급을 받기로 동의하더라도 서비스를 완료하고 그 차액을 받을 때까지 기본 요율로 소득을 누적시켜야 합니다. 
**선급금.**
일반적으로 선급금을 수령한 연도에 이를 소득으로 신고하십시오. 다만, 선급금을 수령하는 경우 다음 과세 연도까지 선급금을 소득 포함하는 것에 대한 연기를 선택할 수 있습니다. 해당 과세 연도를 넘어서 대금의 소득 포함을 연기할 수 없습니다. 
자세한 내용은 간행물 538 및 섹션 451을 참고하십시오
#### 비용
발생기준 회계 방식에 따라 다음 두 가지가 모두 적용되는 경우 일반적으로 사업 비용을 공제하거나 또는 자본화합니다.
  1. 모든 사건 테스트가 충족된 경우. 다음과 같은 경우, 테스트가 충족됩니다.
    1. 부채 사실을 변경하는 모든 사건이 발생한 경우. 그리고
    2. 부채는 합리적인 정확도로 결정될 수 있는 경우.
  2. 경제적 성과가 발생했습니다.


**경제적 성과.**
일반적으로 경제적 성과가 발생하기 전에는 사업 비용을 공제하거나 자본화할 수 없습니다. 귀하에게 제공된 자산이나 서비스를 위한 비용 또는 귀하가 자산을 사용할 때의 비용의 경우, 경제적 성과는 자산 또는 서비스가 제공되거나 자산이 사용됨에 따라 발생합니다. 귀하가 타인에게 제공하는 자산이나 서비스에 대한 비용인 경우, 귀하가 자산이나 서비스를 제공함에 따라 경제적 성과가 발생합니다. 예외적으로, 경제적 성과가 발생하지 않았음에도 불구하고 반복되는 특정 항목을 과세 연도에 발생한 것으로 취급할 수 도 있게 합니다. 경제적 성과에 대한 자세한 내용은, 간행물 538의 _발생기준 방식_ 에서 _경제적 성과_ 를 참고하십시오. 
**예시.**
귀하는 역년 납세자로, 발생기준 회계 방식을 사용합니다. 귀하는 2024년 12월에 사무용품을 구매했습니다. 12월에 물품과 청구서를 받았지만, 2025년 1월에 청구 금액을 지불합니다. 부채 사실을 결정하는 모든 사건이 발생했고, 부채 금액이 합리적으로 결정될 수 있었으며, 그 해에 경제적 성과가 발생했기 때문에 2024년에 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다.
사무용품은 정기적인 비용으로 간주될 수 있습니다. 이 경우 용품이 2025년 (경제적 성과가 발생할 때)이 되기 전에 배달되지 않더라도 2024년에 공제할 수 있습니다.
**재고자산 보관.**
상품의 생산, 구매 또는 판매가 사업에서 소득을 창출하는 요소이고, 소규모 사업체 납세자가 아닌 경우 일반적으로 과세 연도의 초와 말에 재고자산을 상계해야 합니다. 재고자산을 계산해야 하는 경우, 일반적으로 구매 및 판매에 대해 발생기준 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은, 나중에 [_재고자산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313270 "재고자산")을 참고하십시오. 
**이해관계자를 위한 특별 규칙.**
현금 회계 방식을 사용하는 이해관계자에게 빚진 사업 비용 및 이자는 지급할 때까지 공제할 수 없으며 해당 금액은 이해관계자의 총소득에 포함됩니다. 이 규칙에 따라 비용 또는 이자를 공제할 수 있는 과세 연도가 끝날 때 관계를 결정합니다. 이 규칙에 따라 공제가 허용되지 않는 경우 비용 또는 이자가 해당 개인의 총소득에서 공제 가능하게 되기 전에 해당 개인과의 관계가 종료되더라도 이 규칙은 계속 적용됩니다. 
이해관계자에는 형제자매 (양부모 또는 한 쪽 부모가 같은 경우), 배우자, 조상 및 직계 후손을 포함한 직계 가족 구성원이 포함됩니다. 기타 이해관계자 목록은 국세법 섹션 267을 참고하십시오.
#### 조합 방식
일반적으로 조합 방식이 소득과 비용을 명확하게 보여주고 이를 꾸준히 사용하는 경우 현금, 발생기준 및 특별 회계 방식을 조합하여 사용할 수 있습니다. 그러나 다음과 같은 제한이 적용됩니다.
  * 소득을 계산하기 위해 재고자산이 필요한 경우, 일반적으로 구매 및 판매에 대해 발생기준 방식을 사용해야 합니다. (그러나, 나중에 [_재고자산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313270 "재고자산")을 참고하십시오.) 소득과 비용의 다른 모든 항목에 대해선 현금 방식을 사용할 수 있습니다.
  * 소득을 계산할 때 현금 방식을 사용하는 경우, 비용을 신고할 때 반드시 현금 방식을 사용해야 합니다.
  * 비용을 신고할 때 발생기준 방식을 사용하는 경우, 소득을 파악할 때 발생기준 방식을 사용해야 합니다.
  * 현금 방식을 포함하는 조합 방식을 사용하는 경우, 그 조합 방식을 현금 방식으로 간주하십시오.


#### 재고자산
일반적으로 사업에서 상품을 생산, 구매 또는 판매하는 경우, 재고자산을 유지하고 상품 구매 및 판매에 대해 발생기준 방식을 사용해야 합니다.
**소규모 사업체 납세자에 대한 예외 사항.**
소규모 사업체 납세자의 경우 재고자산을 보관하지 않는 것을 선택할 수 있지만, 반드시 소득을 명확하게 반영하는 재고자산 회계 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 재고자산을 보관하지 않기로 선택한 경우, 재고자산 회계 방식이 재고자산을 비임시 자재 또는 용품으로 취급하거나 재고자산에 대한 재무 회계 처리에 부합하는 경우 소득을 명확하게 반영하지 못한 것으로 취급하지 않습니다. 그러나, 재고자산을 보관하기로 선택한 경우, 일반적으로 매년 재고자산의 회계 및 가치에 대한 발생기준 방식을 사용하여 스케줄 C의 파트 3에서 판매된 물품의 매출원가를 결정해야 합니다.
_**소규모 사업체 납세자.**_
(a) 이전 3년 과세 연도의 연평균 총매출이 $3,000만 이하이고 (b) 조세 피난처가 아닌 경우 (섹션 448(d)(3)에 정의됨), 소규모 사업체 납세자로 적격합니다. 귀하의 사업체가 평균 총소득을 계산하는 데 사용된 3년의 과세 연도 기간 내내 존재하지 않았던 경우, 존재했던 기간의 평균 총매출을 기준으로 합니다. 귀하의 사업체에 전신인 사업체가 있는 경우, 평균 총매출을 계산할 때 필요한 3년의 납세 기간에 전신인 사업체의 총매출을 포함하십시오. 귀하의 사업체 (또는 전신인 사업체)의 과세 연도 3년 중 짧은 과세 연도가 있는 경우, 과세 연도 3년 중 짧은 과세 연도의 사업 총매출을 연율로 환산합니다. 자세한 정보는, 간행물 538을 참고하십시오.
_**재고자산을 비임시 자재 또는 용품으로 취급하기.**_
재고자산을 비임시 자재 및 용품으로 계산하는 경우, 자재 및 용품이 처음 사용되거나 소비된 해에 비임시 자재 및 용품으로 취급되는 자재 또는 용품의 획득 또는 생산을 위해 지급되거나 발생한 금액을 공제합니다. 비임시 자재 및 용품으로 취급되는 재고자산은 고객에게 재고자산을 제공한 연도에 귀하의 사업체에서 사용되거나 소비됩니다.
_**재고자산의 재무회계 처리.**_
재고자산에 대한 재무 회계 처리는 귀하에게 해당하는 재무제표에 사용하는 회계 방식 (섹션 451(b)(3)에 정의됨)과 관련하여 결정됩니다. 또는, 귀하에게 해당하는 재무제표가 없는 경우에는 회계 절차에 따라 작성된 장부와 기록에서 사용하는 회계 방식과 관련하여 결정됩니다.
_**재고자산에 대한 회계 방식 변경.**_
재고자산에 대한 회계 방식을 변경하려면 반드시 양식 3115, ‘회계 방식 변경 신청서’를 제출해야 합니다. [_회계 방식 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313285 "회계 방식 변경")을 참고하십시오.
**재고자산에 포함된 품목.**
재고자산 계산이 요규되는 경우, 이를 계산할 때 다음 항목을 재고자산에 포함시키십시오. 
  * 거래 중인 상품 또는 재고.
  * 원자재.
  * 진행 중인 작업물.
  * 완제품.

#### 어떻게 손익을 계산해야 합니까?
**표 . 표 3-1. 이득 또는 손실을 파악하는 방법**
**만약 ...** | **그렇다면...**  
---|---  
조정된 기초가액이 실현된 금액보다 많다면 | 손실이 발생합니다.  
실현된 금액이 조정된 기초가액보다 많다면 | 이득이 발생합니다.  
기초가액, 조정된 기초가액, 실현된 금액, 공정시장가격, 인정된 금액은 다음에 정의됩니다. 손익을 계산하려면 이러한 정의를 알아야 합니다.
**기초가액.**
자산 비용 또는 매입 가격은 대개 매각 또는 다른 처분으로 인한 손익을 파악하기 위한 기초가액입니다. 다만, 증여, 상속 또는 매수 이외의 방법으로 자산을 취득한 경우에는 그 비용 이외의 기초가액을 사용하여야 합니다. 기초가액에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 551, ‘자산의 기초가액’을 참고하십시오.
**조정된 기초가액.**
자산의 조정된 기초가액은 일반적으로 기초가액 또는 기타 기초가액에 특정 가산금을 더한 금액이며, 감가상각비 및 재해 손실과 같은 특정 공제액을 제한 금액입니다. 손익을 판단할 때, 매각 비용과 같이 새로운 소유자에게 자산을 이전하는 비용은 자산의 조정된 기초가액에 추가됩니다.
**실현된 금액.**
일반적으로 처분에서 실현된 금액은 귀하가 받는 모든 돈의 총액과 귀하가 받는 모든 자산이나 서비스의 공정시장가격을 더한 금액입니다. 또한, 귀하의 실현 금액에는 매수자가 인수한 모든 부채와 귀하가 양도한 자산에 적용되는 모든 부채 (예: 부동산 세금 또는 담보대출)가 포함됩니다. 
**공정시장가격.**
공정시장가격은 매수자와 매도자 사이에 자산이 교환되는 가격이며, 매수하거나 매도할 필요도 없고, 둘 다 모든 필요한 사실에 대한 합리적인 지식을 가지고 있는 가격입니다.
**인정된 금액.**
자산 처분으로 인해 실현된 이익 또는 손실은 일반적으로 세금 목적으로 인정된 이익 또는 손실입니다. 총소득에 인정된 이익을 포함시켜야 합니다. 인정된 손실은 총소득에서 공제됩니다. 그러나 특정 자산 교환으로 인해 실현된 이익 또는 손실은 인정되지 않습니다. 이전의 [_비과세 교환_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313291 "비과세 교환.")을 참고하십시오. 또한, 개인 용도로 보유한 자산 처분에서 손실을 공제할 수 없습니다. 
#### 내 손익이 경상 손익입니까 자본 손익입니까?
귀하의 손익을 경상 혹은 자본 손익으로 분류해야 합니다. 순 자본 손익을 계산하려면 이렇게 해야 합니다. 일반적으로, 자본 자산을 처분하면 자본 이익 또는 손실이 발생합니다. 대부분의 경우, 개인 목적 또는 투자를 위해 소유하고 사용하는 모든 자산은 자본 자산입니다.
사업체에서 사용하는 특정 자산은 자본 자산이 아닙니다. 이 자산 처분으로 인한 이익 또는 손실은 경상 이익 또는 손실입니다. 그러나 해당 자산을 1년 이상 보유한 경우 이익 또는 손실을 자본 이익 또는 손실로 처리할 수 있습니다. 이러한 손익은 섹션 1231 손익이라고 합니다.
경상 및 자본 손익에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 544의 2장 및 3장을 참고하십시오.
#### 내 자본 손익이 단기입니까 장기입니까?
자본 이익 또는 손실이 있는 경우, 장기인지 단기인지 여부를 결정해야 합니다. 이익 또는 손실이 장기 또는 단기인지 여부는 자산을 처분하기 전에 자산을 얼마나 오래 소유하느냐에 달려 있습니다. 처분하기 전에 자산을 소유한 기간을 보유 기간이라고 합니다.
**표 . 표 3-2. 나에게 단기 또는 장기 손익이 있습니까?**
**자산을 보유하는 경우...** | **그렇다면...**  
---|---  
1년 이하 | 단기 자본 손익.  
1년 초과 | 장기 자본 손익.  
단기 및 장기 자본 손익에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 544의 4장을 참고하십시오.
#### 손익을 어디에 신고합니까?

#### 소개
이 장에서는 주로 사업소득에 대해 설명하며 이 소득을 세금 신고서에서 회계 처리 하는 방법 및 소득으로 고려되지 않는 항목에 대해 설명하며, 선택된 직업에 대한 지침을 제공합니다.
귀하가 받는 소득과 귀하의 사업에 관련성이 있는 경우, 그 소득은 사업 소득입니다. 사업이 존재하지 않았다면 수입의 지급이 이루어지지 않았을 것이 분명하 다면 이 관련성이 존재합니다.
정규 풀타임으로 활동에 참여하지 않더라도 사업 소득이 있을 수 있습니다.. 정규 업무 외에 부업으로 인한 수입은 사업 소득이 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 두 번째 직업으로 차량 공유 사업을 위한 서비스를 제공하는 사업에 종사할 수 있습니다.
제품 또는 서비스 판매 소득과 같은 대부분의 사업 소득을 스케줄 C에 신고합니다. 그러나 토지 및 사무실 건물과 같은 사업용 자산의 매각으로 인한 소득은 스케줄 C 대신 다른 양식에 신고합니다. 사업용 자산 매각에 대한 자세한 내용은 [3장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313287 "사업용 자산의 처분")을 참고하십시오.

**사업 소득 공제.**
스케줄 C에 신고하는 소득은 적격 사업 소득이 될 수 있으며 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 13에서 공제 혜택을 받을 수 있습니다. 공제액이 있는 경우, 양식 8995-A 또는 양식 8995를 참조하여 파악합니다.

**선불 임대료.**
사용 또는 향유에 제한을 두지 않는 임대차 계약으로 수령한 선급금은 수령한 연도의 소득입니다. 이는 일반적으로 어떤 회계 방식이나 기간을 사용해도 마찬가지입니다. 
**임대차 계약 보너스.**
임차인으로부터 임대차 허가에 대해 받은 보너스는 임대료에 추가됩니다. 수령한 연도의 총소득에 포함합니다. 
**임대차 계약 취소 위약금.**

#### 개인 자산 임대
개인 자산 (장비, 차량, 정장 등)을 대여하는 사업에 종사하는 경우 총소득에 대여료를 포함합니다 (스케줄 C 사용). 이전의 _부동산 임대_ 아래 기술된 선불 임대료 및 기타 대금은 개인 자산 대여에 대한 것이 될 수도 있습니다. 해당 대금을 수령하는 경우, 해당 논의에 설명된 대로 총소득에 해당 금액을 포함합니다.
#### 이자 및 배당 소득
이자 및 배당금은 사업 소득으로 간주될 수 있습니다.
**이자.**
통상적인 사업 과정에서 수취어음에 대해 받은 이자는 사업 소득입니다. 대출에 대해 받은 이자는 대급업에 종사하는 경우 사업 소득입니다. 
_**회수 불가 대출.**_
발생기준 회계 방식을 사용하는 경우, 과세 연도에 귀하에게 지급되어야 할 대출금을 회수할 수 없게 되어 대출을 받을 수 없는 시점까지 누적된 적격 명시된 이자를 일반적으로 반드시 총소득에 포함해야 합니다. 나중에 발생한 이자가 회수되지 않으면 대손상각 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 8장에서 [_대손상각_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313495 "대손상각")을 참고하십시오.

이전 해에 공제된 사업 보험료에서 배당금을 수령하는 경우, 배당금의 전부 또는 일부를 사업 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 신고해야 하는 금액에 대해 알아보려면, 나중에 [_이전에 공제된 항목의 회수_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313397 "이전에 공제된 항목의 회수.")를 _기타소득_ 에서 참고하십시오. 
#### 취소된 채무
다음은 취소된 부채를 소득에 포함시키는 일반적인 규칙과 이 일반 규칙에 대한 예외를 설명합니다.
#### 일반 규칙

#### 예외
다음 논의에서는 취소된 채무에 대한 일반 규칙의 예외 몇가지를 다룹니다.
**구매 후 가격 인하.**
귀하가 구입한 자산에 대해 판매자에게 채무를 지고 판매자가 귀하의 채무 금액을 줄이면 일반적으로 감액으로 인한 소득이 없습니다. 귀하가 파산하지 않는 한, 감가상각액을 매입가격 조정으로 처리하고 자산의 기초가액을 줄입니다. 
**공제 가능 채무.**
채무 취소로 인한 소득은 채무 상환으로 인한 공제로 이어질 수 있는 범위 내에서 실현되지 않습니다. 
**예.**
귀하는 사업에 대한 회계 서비스를 외상으로 받았습니다. 나중에 사업 부채를 갚는 데 어려움이 있지만 파산하지 않았습니다. 귀하의 회계사는 귀하가 회계 서비스에 대해 지급해야 할 금액의 일부를 탕감해줍니다.이 취소된 채무를 처리하는 방법은 귀하의 회계 방식에 따라 다릅니다. 
  * 현금 방식 - 부채 상환으로 사업 비용 공제를 받을 수 있었기 때문에 취소된 채무는 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
  * 발생기준 방식 - 채무가 발생했을 때 비용이 공제되었기 때문에 취소된 채무를 소득에 포함합니다.


회계처리의 현금 방식 및 발생기준 방식에 대한 내용은 [2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313225 "회계 기간 및 회계 방식")을 참고하십시오.

**적격 부동산 사업 채무.**
적격 부동산 사업 채무의 취소를 (일정 한도까지) 제외하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 할 경우, 감가상각할 수 있는 부동산의 기초가액을 제외된 금액만큼 감소시켜야 합니다. 취소가 발생한 과세 연도 다음 해 과세 연도 초반에 이 감액을 실시합니다. 다만, 그 전에 자산을 처분한 경우에는 그 처분 직전에 그 기초가액을 감액하여야 합니다. 
_**적격 부동산 사업 채무 취소.**_
적격 부동산 사업 채무는 다음 조건을 모두 충족하는 채무 (적격 농장 채무는 제외)입니다.

  2. 취소 직전에 보유한 감가상각 가능한 부동산의 총 조정 기초가액. 이러한 조정된 기준액은 파산의 취소 또는 적격 농업 부채로 인한 모든 기초가액 감소 후 결정됩니다. 취소를 고려하여 취득한 감가상각 부동산은 고려하지 마십시오. 


_**선택.**_
이 선택을 하려면, 양식 982을 작성하고, 취소가 발생한 과세 연도의 소득세 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 기한 (연장일 포함) 내에 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 선택을 하지 않고 해당 연도의 신고서를 적시에 제출한 경우, 신고 마감일 (연장일 제외)로부터 6개월 이내에 수정된 신고서를 제출하여 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 _제출 시기_ 를 양식의 지침에서 확인하십시오.

양식 1099-MISC 또는 양식 1099-NEC에 보고된 특정 메디케이드 면제 지급금은 과세 대상이 아닐 수 있습니다. 지급금 신고 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 스케줄 C 지침 (양식 1040) 을 참조하십시오.
**공사 수당.**
1997년 8월 5일 이후 임대차 계약을 체결한 경우, 다음 두 가지 조건 하에서 임대인으로부터 받은 공사수당 (현금 또는 임대료 감면)을 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다.

**임차인 개보수.**
임차인이 건물을 세우거나 귀하의 자산을 개보수하는 경우, 이 개보수로 인한 자산 가치의 상승은 귀하에게 소득이 아닙니다. 그러나, 개보수가 임대료로 지급되었다는 사실이 존재한다면, 가치의 증가는 소득이 될 것입니다. 
**대출.**
진실된 대출을 통해 빌린 돈은 소득이 아닙니다.

#### 소득 계상
소득세 목적의 소득의 계상은 때때로 재무 목적을 위한 회계와 다릅니다. 이 섹션에서는 사업적 거래에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 더 일반적인 차이점에 대해 설명합니다.
과세 연도를 기준으로 정규 회계 방식에 따라 사업 소득을 파악합니다 ([2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313225 "회계 기간 및 회계 방식") 참조). 제품 판매가 사업에서 소득을 창출하는 요소인 경우, 일반적으로 소득을 명확히 표시하기 위해 재고자산을 사용해야 합니다. 부동산 중개사는 재고자산을 사용할 수 없습니다. 재고자산에 대한 자세한 내용은 [2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313225 "회계 기간 및 회계 방식")을 참고하십시오.
**제삼자에게 지급된 소득.**
귀하가 벌어들인 모든 소득은 귀하에게 과세됩니다. 제삼자에게 소득을 지급하는 것으로는 세금을 피할 수 없습니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 부동산을 임대하고 임대 계약에서 임차인이 귀하의 아들에게 임대료를 지불하도록 지시합니다. 아들에게 지급된 금액은 귀하의 총소득입니다. 
**현금 할인.**
이러한 금액은 판매자가 신속한 결제를 위해 송장 가격에서 공제할 수 있도록 허용하는 금액입니다. 소득세 신고 시 다음 두 가지 방법 중 하나를 사용하여 현금 할인 혜택을 받을 수 있습니다. 
  1. 매입에서 현금 할인을 공제 (6장의 [_라인 36-매입에서 개인 용도로 사용한 항목의 비용을 차감_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313457 "라인 36–매입에서 개인 용도로 사용한 항목의 비용을 차감")을 참고하십시오).
  2. 현금 할인 혜택을 할인 소득 계정에서 대변합니다.


모든 구매 할인에 대해 매년 선택한 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 
두 번째 방식을 사용하는 경우, 과세 연도 말 계정의 대변 잔액은 사업 소득입니다. 이 방식에서는 매출원가에서 현금 할인 가격을 절감할 수 없습니다. 기말재고액을 평가할 때, 과세 연도가 끝날 때 보유한 상품의 송장 가격을 상품의 평균 또는 추정할인액만큼 감소시킬 수 없습니다. 
**매입 할인.**
이것은 목록 또는 카탈로그 가격의 감소이며 일반적으로 송장에 기록되거나 고객에게 청구되지 않습니다. 귀하의 회계 장부에 이러한 할인을 입력하지 마십시오. 대신 순 금액만 구매한 상품의 비용으로 사용합니다. 자세한 내용은 6장에서 [_매입 할인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313458 "매입 할인.")을 참고하십시오.
**에스크로에 배치한 대금.**
자산 구매자가 구매 가격의 일부 또는 전부를 에스크로에 배치하는 경우, 실제로 또는 추정적으로 수령하기 전까지는 매출 총액에 그 일부를 포함하지 않습니다. 그러나 계약 조건 및 에스크로 계약이 완료되면 다음 해까지 돈을 받지 않더라도 과세 소득이 있습니다. 
**매출환입 및 애누리.**
반품된 상품에 대해 고객에게 허용하는 감액과 기타 판매에 대한 애누리는 순 매출을 산정하기 위해 총매출에서 차감한 금액입니다. 
**선급금.**
선불로 받은 대금에 대한 발생기준 회계 방식을 다루는 특별 규칙은 2장의 [_발생주의 방식_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313254 "발생기준 방식")에서 다룹니다.
**보험금.**
재해 또는 도난 손실에 대한 보험금 또는 다른 유형의 상환을 받는 경우, 공제 금액을 파악할 때 손실에서 이를 차감해야 합니다. 재해 또는 도난 손실에 대해 상환된 부분을 공제할 수 없습니다. 
재해 또는 도난 손실에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 547을 참고하십시오.
## 6. 매출원가 계산 방법
#### 소개
판매할 상품을 만들거나 매입하는 경우 스케줄 C에서 매출원가를 총소득에서부터 공제할 수 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 비용을 결정하려면 각 과세 연도의 시작과 말에 재고의 가치를 평가해야 합니다.
이 장은 제조업자, 도매업자 또는 소매업자이거나 소득을 창출하기 위해 상품을 제조, 구매 또는 판매하는 사업에 종사하는 경우 적용됩니다. 이 장은 의사, 변호사, 목수 또는 화가의 사업과 같은 개인 서비스 사업에는 적용되지 않습니다. 다만, 개인서비스업에 종사하는 자로서 사업에 일반적으로 사용되는 자재 및 용품 등을 판매 또는 청구하는 경우에는 이 장이 적용됩니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_소규모 사업체 납세자에게는 예외가 있으며, 이로 인해 기업을 위해 매출원가가 변경될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은_[2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313225 "회계 기간 및 회계 방식") _을 참고하십시오._.
#### 스케줄 C, 라인 35부터 라인 42에서 매출원가 파악하기
매출원가를 파악하기 위해 스케줄 C의 라인 35 부터 라인 42까지 작성합니다. 이러한 항목은 아래에 재현되며 이어지는 논의에서 설명됩니다.
**35** | 연초재고액. 지난해의 기말재고액과 다른 경우, 설명을 첨부하십시오 | _____  
---|---|---  
**36** | 매입에서 개인 용도로 사용한 항목의 비용을 차감하십시오 | _____  
**37** | 인건비. 본인에게 지급된 금액은 포함하지 마십시오 | _____  
**38** | 자재 및 비품 | _____  
**39** | 기타 비용 |   
**40** | 라인 35~라인 39를 합하십시오 | _____  
**41** | 연말재고액 |   
**42** | **매출원가.** 라인 40에서 라인 41을 차감합니다. 여기와 라인 4에 결과를 입력합니다 |   
#### 라인 35–연초재고액
귀하가 판매자인 경우, 기초재고액은 고객에게 판매하기 위해 연초에 보유한 상품의 비용입니다. 제조자 또는 생산자인 경우 원재료 총비용, 공정 작업, 완제품 및 제품 제조에 사용되는 재료 및 공급품을 포함합니다 (2장에서 [_재고자산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313270 "재고자산")을 참고하십시오).
기초재고액은 일반적으로 전년도의 기말재고액과 동일합니다. 동일하지 않다면 신고서에 첨부된 스케줄에서 이러한 차이에 대해 설명해야 합니다.
**재고자산 기증.**
재고 (사업 상 판매하는 자산)를 기부하는 경우, 자선 기부 공제를 할 수 있는 금액은 기여한 날의 공정시장가격 또는 그 기초가액 중 적은 금액입니다. 기증된 재고의 기초가액은 이전 연도의 재고에 대해 발생한 비용으로, 기부하지 않았을 경우 기부 연도의 기초재고액에 포함됐을 금액입니다. 기초재고액에서 기부 공제 금액을 삭제해야 합니다. 이는 매출원가의 일부가 아닙니다.
기증된 재고의 비용이 기초재고액에 포함되지 않았던 경우, 이 재고의 기초가액은 0이며 자선 기부 공제를 할 수 없습니다. 일반적으로 귀하의 회계 방식에서 취급하는 것처럼 재고 비용을 취급합니다. 예를 들어, 같은 해에 구매하고 기부한 재고의 구매 가격을 해당 연도의 매출원가에 포함시키십시오.
특정 식품 재고의 기부에는 특별 규칙이 적용될 수 있습니다. 간행물 526, 자선 기부’를 참고하십시오.
**예시 1.**
귀하는 역년 납세자로, 발생기준 회계 방식을 사용합니다. 2024년, 귀하는 교회에 재고 자산을 기부했습니다. 공정시장가격은 $600였습니다. 2023년 말 기말재고액에는 자산 취득 비용 $400가 올바르게 포함되었으며, 2023년에는 자산에 귀속된 관리비 및 기타 비용 $50를 사업 비용으로 올바르게 공제했습니다. 2024년에 허용되는 자선 기부금은 $400 ($600 − $200)입니다. $200는 증여일의 공정시장가격으로 기증 재고를 판매했다면 경상 소득이 됐을 금액입니다. 2024년 총소득을 결정하는 데 사용하는 매출원가는 $400을 포함하지 않아야 합니다. 귀하는 2024년 기초재고액에서 해당 금액을 삭제합니다.
**예시 2.**
만약 _[예 1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313455 "예시 1.")_ 에서, 귀하가 2024년에 $400의 비용으로 기부 자산을 취득한 경우, 2024년에 매출원가를 계산하는 데 $400의 자산 비용을 포함하고 해당 연도의 자산에 귀속된 관리비 및 기타 비용 $50를 공제합니다. 기부 자산에 대한 자선 기부 공제가 허용되지 않습니다.
#### 라인 36–매입에서 개인 용도로 사용한 항목의 비용을 차감
귀하가 판매자인 경우, 판매를 위해 매입한 모든 상품의 비용을 사용하십시오. 귀하가 제조자 또는 생산자인 경우, 여기에는 완제품 제조를 위해 매입한 모든 원자재 또는 부품 비용이 포함됩니다.
**매입 할인.**
물품의 명시된 가격과 귀하가 실제 지불하는 가격의 차이를 매입 할인이라고 합니다. 매입 비용을 파악하는 데 지불하는 가격 (명시된 가격이 아님)을 사용해야 합니다. 총소득에 별도로 할인액을 항목으로 표시하지 않습니다.
자동차 중개인은 매입 할인을 나타내는 제조업체의 리베이트로 인하된 자동차 비용을 재고자산에 기록해야 합니다. 
**현금 할인.**
현금 할인은 공급업체가 신속한 결제를 위해 구매 송장에서 공제할 수 있는 금액입니다. 현금 할인에는 두 가지 회계 방식이 있습니다. 해당 금액을 별도의 할인 계좌에 입금하거나 해당 연도의 총구매액에서 공제할 수 있습니다. 어떤 방법을 사용하든, 일관성이 있어야 합니다. 재고에 대한 회계 방식을 변경하려면 양식 3115, ‘회계 방식 변경 신청서’를 제출하십시오. 자세한 내용은 2장에서 [_회계 방식 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313285 "회계 방식 변경")을 참고하십시오.
현금 할인을 별도의 계정에 입금하는 경우, 과세 연도 말에 이 세액공제 잔액을 사업 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 이 방식에서는 현금 할인 매출원가를 절감할 수 없습니다.
**매입 환입 및 에누리.**
한 해 동안의 총매입액에서 모든 환입 및 에누리를 공제해야 합니다.
**인출된 판매품.**
귀하가 개인용 또는 가족용으로 상품을 인출하는 경우, 판매를 위해 매입한 상품의 총액에서 이 비용을 제외해야 합니다. 개인 용도로 인출한 상품의 비용을 매입 또는 매출 계좌에서 대변합니다. 또한 해당 금액을 인출금 계정에 적립해야 합니다. 
인출금 계좌는 개인 및 가족 비용 지불을 위해 인출한 사업 소득을 기록하기 위해 보관해야 하는 별도의 계좌입니다. 위에서 언급한 바와 같이, 개인 또는 가족용으로 상품의 인출을 기록하는 데도 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 계정은 인출 계정 또는 개인 계정이라고도 합니다. 
#### 라인 37–인건비
인건비는 일반적으로 제조 또는 광업 사업에만 해당되는 매출원가 요소입니다. 소상인 (도매상, 소매상 등)은 일반적으로 매출원가에 대해 적절하게 부과할 수 있는 인건비가 없습니다. 제조 사업에서, 매출원가에 적절히 할당 가능한 인건비는 원자재를 완제품으로 제조하는데 사용되는 직접 노동과 간접 노동을 모두 포함합니다.
**직접 인건비.**
직접 인건비는 제조 중인 제품을 직접 작업하는 데 모든 시간을 할애하는 직원에게 지불하는 급여입니다. 또한, 임금의 해당 부분을 결정할 수 있다면 제품 직접 작업에 시간제로 일하는 직원에게 지불하는 임금의 일부도 포함됩니다. 
**간접 인건비.**
간접 인건비는 판매 가능한 제품을 만드는 데 직간접적인 연관은 없지만 제조 공정에서 필수적인 부분인 일반 공장 업무를 수행하는 직원에게 지불하는 급여입니다.
**기타 인건비.**
매출원가에 대하여 적절히 부과할 수 없는 기타 인건비는 판매 또는 관리 비용으로 공제할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로, 매출원가에 대해 적절히 청구 가능한 인건비의 종류는 직접 또는 간접 인건비와 제조 공정에 적절히 청구된 간접비로 취급되는 특정 기타 비용뿐입니다. 이는 나중에 _라인 39–기타 비용_ 에서 논의합니다. 
#### 라인 38—자재 및 비품
제품 제조에 사용되는 하드웨어 및 화학 물질과 같은 자재 및 비품은 매출원가에 청구됩니다. 제조 공정에서 사용되지 않는 것은 이연으로 처리됩니다. 사용할 때 이를 사업 비용으로 공제합니다. 사업 비용은 [8장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313491 "사업 비용")에서 논의합니다.
#### 라인 39–기타 비용
매출원가에 청구되는 제조 또는 광업 공정에서 발생하는 기타 비용의 예는 다음과 같습니다.
**컨테이너.**
제조된 제품의 필수적인 부분인 컨테이너 및 패키지는 매출원가의 일부입니다. 제조 제품에서 필수적인 부분이 아닌 경우, 그 비용은 배송 또는 판매 비용입니다. 
**인수 운임.**
원자재 화물 운송, 특송, 카트 운송, 생산에 사용하는 소모품 및 판매를 위해 매입하는 상품은 모두 매출원가의 일부입니다. 
**간접비.**
간접 비용에는 임대료, 열, 조명, 전력, 보험, 감가상각, 세금, 유지 보수, 노동, 감독과 같은 비용이 포함됩니다. 제조 작업에서 직접 및 필요 비용으로 보유한 간접비는 매출원가에 포함됩니다. 
#### 라인 40–라인 35에서 라인 39까지 합산
라인 35에서 라인 39의 총합은 당해 동안 판매가능 상품 원가와 같습니다.
#### 라인 41–연말 재고
기말재고액의 가치 (적절한 경우 원자재 및 비품 비용, 직접 노동 및 간접비의 할당 가능한 부분 포함)를 라인 40에서 차감합니다. 연말 재고는 기말재고액으로도 또한 알려져 있습니다. 기말재고액은 일반적으로 다음 과세 연도의 기초재고액이 됩니다.
#### 라인 42–매출 원가
판매 가능한 상품의 원가에서 기말재고액 (연말 재고)을 뺀 나머지는 과세 연도의 매출원가입니다.
## 7. 매출총이익 계산
#### 소개
사업에서 발생한 총매출 ([5장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313345 "사업 소득"))과 매출원가 ([6장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313447 "매출원가 계산 방법"))를 계산했다면, 총이익을 계산할 준비가 된 것입니다. 사업 비용을 공제하기 전에 총이익을 결정해야 합니다. 이런 비용은 [8장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313491 "사업 비용")에서 논의합니다.
**제품 판매 사업체.**
먼저 순 매출을 계산하여 총이익을 계산합니다. 순 매출 (라인 3)을 스케줄 C에서 계산하려면 모든 환입 및 에누리 (라인 2)를 총매출 (라인 1)에서 차감합니다. 환입 및 에누리에는 고객에게 지급하는 현금 또는 신용카드 환불, 할인 및 실제 판매 가격에서 차감된 기타 에누리가 포함됩니다. 
그다음, 매출원가 (라인 4)를 순 매출 (라인 3)에서 차감합니다. 그 결과, 사업의 매출총이익을 얻을 수 있습니다. 
**서비스 제공 사업체.**
상품 판매가 귀하의 사업에 소득을 창출하는 요소가 아닌 경우 매출원가를 계산할 필요가 없습니다. 매출총이익은 순 매출과 동일합니다 (총매출에서 환불, 할인 또는 기타 에누리를 뺀 금액). 제품이 아닌 서비스를 판매하는 대부분의 직업 및 사업체는 이러한 방식으로 순 매출에서 직접적인 매출총이익을 파악할 수 있습니다. 
**일러스트.**
소매업 손익계산서의 매출총이익 항목 일러스트는 매출총이익 계산법을 보여줍니다. 
**표 . 손익계산서 2024년 12월 31일에 연도 마감 **

빼기: 기말재고액 | _32,955_  
**매출원가** | **$288,140**  
#### 확인해야 할 항목
매출총이익을 계산하기 전에 다음 항목을 고려합니다.
**총매출.**
영업일이 끝날 때마다 해당 일의 실제 현금 및 신용카드 영수증과 잔액이 일치하는지 확인하십시오. 현금 인출기를 사용하여 매출을 추적하는 것이 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 또한, 적절한 송장 시스템을 사용하고 사업을 위한 별도의 은행 계좌를 유지해야 합니다.
**수금한 판매세.**
수금한 판매세가 올바르게 기록되었는지 확인하십시오.
귀하가 상품 또는 서비스의 판매자로서 귀하에게 부과된 주 및 지방 판매세를 구매자로부터 수금하는 경우, 총소득에 수금된 금액을 포함해야 합니다.
귀하가 구매자에게 부과된 주 및 지방 세금을 수금하여 주 또는 지방 정부에 납부해야 하는 경우, 일반적으로 이러한 금액은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
**기초재고액.**
이 수치를 지난해 기말재고액과 비교합니다. 두 금액은 일반적으로 동일해야 합니다. 
**매입.**
개인 용도로 재고 물품을 가져가는 경우 (직접 사용, 가족에게 제공, 개인 선물 등), 매출원가에서 해당 물품을 제거해야 합니다. 매출원가 조정 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 6장에서 [_인출된 판매품_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313462 "인출된 판매품.")을 참고하십시오.
**기말재고액.**
재고 회수를 위한 절차가 적절한지 확인하십시오. 이러한 절차에 모든 품목이 재고자산에 포함되고 적절한 가격 책정 기법이 사용되었는지 확인해야 합니다.
재고자산 양식을 사용하고 기계 테이프를 추가하는 것이 재고자산의 유일한 증거입니다. 재고자산 양식은 사무용품점에서 구입할 수 있습니다. 이 양식에는 각 재고 항목 설명, 수량, 단가 및 가치를 기록하는 열이 있습니다. 각 페이지에는 실제 수량을 산출한 사람, 항목의 가격을 매긴 사람, 확장한 사람, 계산 결과를 판독한 사람을 기록할 수 있는 공간이 있습니다. 이러한 양식은 전체 재고가 정확한지 확인하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한 유효성을 증명할 수 있는 영구적인 기록을 제공합니다. 
재고자산은 [2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313270 "재고자산")에서 논의합니다.
#### 매출총이익의 정확도 검사
소매 또는 도매 사업에 종사하는 경우 매출총이익 수치의 정확성을 확인할 수 있습니다. 먼저 매출총이익을 순수입으로 나눕니다. 결과 백분율은 상품 매출원가와 판매 가격 사이의 평균 스프레드를 측정합니다.
그런 다음 이 비율을 이윤 정책과 비교합니다. 이 두 백분율 간의 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 없다는 것은 매출총이익 수치가 정확하다는 것을 보여줍니다. 이러한 백분율 간에 큰 차이가 있다면 매출, 매입, 재고자산 또는 기타 비용 항목을 정확하게 파악하지 않았을 수 있습니다. 차이가 나는 이유를 판명해야 합니다.
_**예시.**_
귀하는 소매 사업을 운영합니다. 평균적으로, 상품에 이윤을 매겨 331/3%의 매출총이익을 실현하려고 합니다. 손익계산서에 표시된 순 매출 (총소득에서 환입 및 에누리를 뺀 금액)은 $300,000 입니다. 매출원가는 $200,000 입니다. 이는 $100,000 ($300,000 − $200,000)의 매출총이익으로 귀결됩니다. 올해 결과의 정확성을 테스트하기 위해 조는 매출총이익 ($100,000 )을 순 매출 ($300,000 )으로 나눕니다. 결과는 331/3%로 이윤 비율이 331/3%라는 것을 확인했습니다.
#### 매출총이익에 추가
귀하의 사업체가 정기적인 사업 운영이 아닌 다른 수입원을 가지고 있는 경우, 소득을 스케줄 C의 라인 6에 입력하고 이를 매출총이익에 추가합니다. 그 결과가 총사업 소득입니다. 일부 사례로는 이자를 주는 계좌에서 나오는 소득, 폐품 판매에서 나오는 소득, 특정 연료세 세액공제 및 환급 소득, 대손에서 회수된 금액 등이 있습니다.
## 8. 사업 비용
#### 소개
사업 운영에 소요되는 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이러한 비용은 사업 비용으로 알려져 있습니다. 이것은 자본화하거나 매출원가에 포함할 필요가 없지만 당해 연도에 공제할 수 있는 비용입니다.
공제가 가능하려면, 사업 비용은 경상적이면서 필요한 비용이어야 합니다. 경상 비용은 귀하의 사업 분야에서 일반적이고 허용되는 비용입니다. 필수 비용은 귀하의 사업에 도움이 되고 적절한 비용입니다. 필요하다고 간주되기 위해 비용이 필수 불가결할 필요는 없습니다.
사업 비용 세액공제 일반 규칙에 대한 자세한 내용은 섹션 162 및 이의 규정을 참조하십시오.

#### 대손상각
수금할 수 없는 채무가 있는 경우, 귀하에게는 대손이 있습니다. 대손상각에는 사업 대손상각과 비사업 대손상각 두 가지가 있습니다.
사업 대손상각은 일반적으로 거래 또는 사업을 운영할 때 발생하는 채무입니다. 사업 대손상각을 사업 세금 신고서에서 비용으로 공제할 수 있습니다.
**사업 대손상각.**
사업체 대손상각은 다음 중 한 경우에 해당하는 부채의 무가치에서 발생하는 손실입니다. 
  1. 귀하의 사업에서 생성되거나 획득된 경우.
  2. 부분적으로 또는 완전히 무가치하게 되었을 당시 사업과 밀접한 관련이 있었던 경우.


채무가 발생하는 주된 동기가 사업상의 이유인 경우, 채무는 귀하의 사업과 밀접한 관련이 있습니다. 
사업 대손상각은 주로 고객에 대한 신용판매의 결과입니다. 또한, 공급업체, 고객, 직원 또는 유통업체에 대한 대출의 결과일 수도 있습니다. 고객이 결제하지 않은 상품 및 서비스는 장부에 미수금 또는 수취어음으로 표시됩니다. 이러한 미수금 또는 수취어음의 일부를 수금할 수 없는 경우, 수금할 수 없는 부분은 사업 대손상각입니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_공제를 한 연도 또는 전년도에 미수금이 총소득에 포함된 경우에만 이러한 계정 및 수취어음에 대한 대손상각 공제를 받을 수 있습니다._.
_**발생기준 방식.**_
발생기준 회계 방식을 사용하는 경우, 일반적으로 수입을 올릴 때 소득을 신고하십시오. 미수 매출채권을 소득에 포함시킨 경우 미수금액에 대한 대손상각 공제를 받을 수 있습니다.
_**현금 방식.**_
현금 회계 방식을 사용하는 경우, 일반적으로 대금을 받을 때 소득을 신고하십시오. 귀하가 받지 못했고 수금할 수 없는 금액에 대해서는 해당 금액을 소득에 포함하지 않은 경우, 빚진 금액에 대한 대손상각 공제를 받을 수 없습니다. 
**이전 사업에서의 부채.**
사업체를 매각했지만 이 사업체의 미수금을 보유하고 있는 경우 이러한 부채는 거래 또는 사업으로 인해 발생했기 때문에 사업 부채에 해당합니다.이러한 미수금 중 어느 하나라도 나중에 가치가 없어지더라도 그 손실은 여전히 사업 대손상각에 해당합니다.
_**사망자로부터 취득한 채무.**_
사망자로부터 취득한 사업체의 채무로 인한 손실의 성격은 사업체 구매시 취득한 채무와 동일한 방식으로 결정됩니다. 사망자의 유산 집행자는 채무가의 무가치 해졌을 당시 이 채무가 사망자의 거래 또는 사업과 밀접하게 관련되어 있는 경우, 채무로 인한 손실을 사업 대손상각으로 간주합니다. 그렇지 않으면 이러한 채무로 인한 손실은 사망자의 재산에 대한 비사업 대손상각으로 간주됩니다. 
_**청산**_
사업체를 청산하고 보유하고 있는 미수금 중 일부의 가치가 없어지면 사업 대손상각으로 취급됩니다.
#### 사업 대손상각의 유형
사업 대손상각은 다음과 같은 이유로 발생할 수 있습니다,
**고객 및 공급자에 대한 대출**
사업상의 이유로 고객, 공급업체, 직원 또는 유통업체에 돈을 빌려주었다가 회수를 시도했지만 대출금을 회수를 받을 수 없다면 사업 대손상각이 발생한 것입니다. 
**정당에 대한 채권**
귀하에게 정당 (또는 기부금을 수령하거나 선거에 영향을 미치기 위해 돈을 지출하는 기타 조직)에 대한 채권이 있으며, 이 채권이 무가치하게된 경우, 다음 요건을 모두 충족하는 경우에만 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
  1. 발생적 회계 방식을 사용합니다.
  2. 일반적인 거래 또는 사업 도중, 상품이나 서비스를 판매하여 발생했습니다.
  3. 판매 연도에 발생한 미수금의 30% 이상이 정당에 대한 판매에서 발생했습니다.
  4. 채권 회수하기 위해 상당하고 지속적인 노력을 기울였습니다.


**대출 또는 자본출자**
사실과 상황에 근거하여 대출이 실제로 자본출자인 경우, 법인에 대한 대출에 대해 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 
**파산한 파트너의 채무**
사업 파트너쉽이 해산되고 이전 파트너 중 한 명이 파산하는 경우, 귀하의 파트너쉽 채무의 비례 배분보다 많은 금액을 지불해야 할 수 있습니다. 파산한 파트너의 채무의 일부를 상환하는 경우, 귀하가 지불한 금액 중 파산 파트너의 지분에 귀속되는 금액에 대한 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
**사업 대출 보증**
나중에 가치가 없어진 부채의 보증을 선 경우, 다음 요건이 모두 충족된다면 해당 부채는 사업 대손상각으로 간주될 수 있습니다. 
  * 거래 또는 사업 도중 보증을 섰습니다.
  * 귀하에게는 채무를 값아야 할 법적 의무가 있습니다.
  * 채무의 가치가 없어지기 전에 보증을 섰습니다. 차용인의 전액 상환 없이는 부채를 상환하지 않아도 될 것으로 합리적으로 예상한 경우 이 요건을 충족합니다.
  * 보증에 대한 합리적인 대가를 받았습니다. 일반적인 사업 관행에 따라 또는 선의의 사업 목적으로 보증을 선 경우 이 요건을 충족합니다.


**예시**
제인 제인은 제인 드레스 컴퍼니를 소유하고 있습니다. 그녀는 드레스 아울렛인 엘레강트 패션 (Elegant Fashions) 에 $20,000 어음의 상환을 보증했습니다. 엘레강트 패션은 제인의 최대 고객 중 하나입니다. 엘레강트 패션이 나중에 대출 채무를 불이행했습니다. 그 결과 제인 씨는 남은 대출 잔액을 은행에 전액 상환했습니다.
사업 대손상각 공제는 거래 또는 사업 과정에서 선의의 사업 목적으로 이루어졌기 때문에 지불한 금액에 대해서만 사업 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 제인은 더 나은 고객 중 한 명을 유지하고 판매점을 유지하고 싶다는 열망이 동기였습니다.
_**상환한 연도에 공제 가능**_
보증을 선 대출금을 상환하는 경우, 차용인에 대한 권리가 없는 한 상환한 연도에 차감할 수 있습니다. 
_**차용인에 대한 권리**_
보증을 선 대출금을 상환했을 경우 채권자의 자리를 대신할 권리가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 귀하가 채권자가 됩니다. 이러한 권리 또는 차용인에게 상환을 요구할 수 있는 다른 권리가 있는 경우, 이러한 권리의 일부 또는 전체가 무가치해질 때까지 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 
**공동 채무자**
두명 이상의 채무자에게 공동으로 채권이 있는 경우, 한명의 채무자로부터 채권을 상환받을 수 없다고 해서 일정 금액을 대손상각으로 공제할 수는 없습니다. 
**저당 재산의 매각.**
저당 또는 담보 재산이 채권보다 적은 금액에 매각된 경우, 채권의 미상환 잔액은 대손상각입니다. 
#### 채권이 무가치하게 될 경우
채권이 더 이상 상환될 가능성이 없을때 무가치해집니다. 이는 채권 만기일 또는 그전에 발생할 수 있습니다 .
무가치함을 증명하려면 채권을 환수하기 위한 합당한 조치를 취했지만 그렇게 할 수 없었다는 사실만을 증명하면 됩니다.
**채권에 대해 수령한 자산**
채권 일부 정산을 위해 재산을 양도받은 경우, 재산의 기초가액이 되는 공정시정가격을 채권에서 감축하십시오. 이 채권이 무가치하게 된다면 채권의 잔액을 대손상각으로 공제할 수 있습니다.
이후에 재산을 기초가액보다 높은 금액으로 매각하는 경우, 매각 이득은 해당 재산의 가치 상승으로 인한 것입니다. 이는 대손상각의 회수가 아닙니다. 자산 매각에 관한 정보는간행물 544를 참조하십시오.
#### 사업 대손상각 청구 방법
사업 대손상각을 청구하는 두가지 방식이 있습니다.
  * 특정 결손금 방식
  * 비발생기준-경험 방식.


일반적으로 특정 결손금 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 단, 나중에 논의할 [미발생기준-경험 방식](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000143591 "비발생기준-경험 방식")에서 논하는 요건을 충족하는 경우, 미발생기준-경험 방식을 사용할 수 있습니다. 
**특정 결손금 방식.**
특정 결손금 방식을 사용하면 과세 연도 중에 일부 또는 완전히 무가치하게 된 특정 사업 대손상각을 공제할 수 있습니다. 그러나 일부 가치가 없는 대손상각의 경우, 공제액은 해당 연도에 장부에 결손 공제한 금액으로 제한됩니다.
_**부분적 무가치 채권.**_
과세 연도 중에 일부 회수할 수 없게 된 특정 대손상각을 공제할 수 있습니다. 세금 공제는 해당 연도에 장부에서 결손 공제한 금액으로 제한됩니다. 부분적 무가치한 채권을 매년 결손 공제하고 세금 공제할 필요가 없습니다. 결손 공제를 다음 해로 연기할 수 있습니다. 그러나 채권이 완전히 무가치하게 된 연도가 지나면 채권의 일부를 공제할 수 없습니다. 
결손금 채권과 관련하여 고려해야 할 두 가지 규칙이 있습니다.
  * **상당히 수정된 채권.** 상당히 수정되어 보유자가 이득을 인정한 부채에 대해서는 결손금 규칙에 대한 예외가 존재합니다. 더 자세한 내용은 규정 섹션 1.166-3(a)(3)를 참조하십시오.
  * **불허된 공제.** 일반적으로,장부에 결손 공제를 한 연도에만 부분적 대손상각 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 세무조사에서 IRS가 공제를 불허했으며 이후 과세 연도에 채권이 일부 무가치하게 되는 경우, 해당 연도에 결손 공제 한 금액과 이전 연도에 결손 공제 할 수 없는 금액을 합산한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이전 연도의 결손금은 장부에 번복하지 않는 한 다음 연도의 결손금 요건을 충족합니다.


_**완전히 무가치한 채권.**_
현재 과세 연도에 채권의 가치가 완전히 없어지면 전체 금액에서 채권의 가치가 일부만 없었던 이전 과세 연도에 공제된 금액을 차감한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다.
완전히 무가치한 채권에 대한 대손상각 공제를 청구하기 위해 실제로 장부에 결손 공제를 할 필요는 없습니다. 결손 공제를 하지 않고 IRS가 이후에 채권이 일부만 가치가 없다고 규정하는 경우, 부분적으로 가치가 없는 대손상각 공제가 실제로 결손 공제된 금액으로 제한되기 때문에 해당 과세 연도의 채권에 대한 공제는 허용되지 않습니다. 이전에 나온 _[부분적 무가치 채권](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000143586 "부분적 무가치 채권.")_ 을 참조하십시오. 
_**환급 청구 제기.**_
채권이 무가치하게 된 연도의 원래 신고서에서 대손상각 공제를 하지 않은 경우, 세액공제 또는 환급 청구를 제기할 수 있습니다. 불량 채권이 완전히 무가치해지는 경우, 다음 날짜 중 더 늦은 날짜까지 청구를 제기해야 합니다. 
  * 원래 신고서 마감일로부터 7년 (연장 제외).
  * 세금을 납부한 날로부터 2년.


부분적 무가치 불량 채권에 대한 청구의 경우 다음 날짜 중 더 늦은 날짜까지 청구를 제기해야 합니다. 
  * 원래 신고서 제출일로부터 3년.
  * 세금을 납부한 날로부터 2년. 


신체적 또는 정신적 장애로 인해 재정 문제를 관리할 수 없는 경우, 청구를 제기하는 데 추가적인 시간이 제공될 수 도 있습니다. 이러한 장애에 대한 존재 증명이 필요합니다
청구 제기에 대한 세부사항과 추가적인 정보는 간행물 556을 참조하십시오. 아래의 양식 중 하나를 사용해 청구를 제기하십시오. 더 자세한 내용은 해당 양식에 대한 지침을 참조하십시오.

#### 비발생기준-경험 방식
일반적으로 발생기준 회계 방식을 사용하는 사람은 다음과 같은 경우 회수되지 않을 것으로 보이는 서비스 제공 외상 매출금을 미수금으로 적립할 필요가 없습니다.
  * 제공되는 서비스가 건강, 법률, 엔지니어링, 건축, 회계, 보험 계리 과학, 공연 예술 또는 컨설팅인 경우, 또는
  * 개인의 이전 3과세 연도 기간의 평균 연간 총 수입은 $2,700만을 초과하지 않는 경우.


섹션 448에서 세부사항 및 예외사항을 참조하십시오.
#### 대손상각의 회수
소득세 신고서에 대손상각 공제를 청구했으며 이후에 대손상각의 전액 또는 일부를 회수 (징수) 하는 경우, 회수금 전액 또는 일부를 총소득에 포함해야 할 수 있습니다. 포함되는 금액은 실제로 공제된 금액으로 제한됩니다. 단, 세금을 감면하지 않은 공제 금액은 제외시킬 수 있습니다. 해당 회수금액을 적절한 사업 양식 또는 스케줄에서 “Other income” (기타 소득)으로 신고하십시오.
간행물 525에 있는 _Recoveries_ (회수)에서 더 자세한 내용을 보십시오.
_**NOL 이월.**_
회수가 발생한 과세 연도가 시작되기 전에 대손상각의 공제가 만료되지 않은 NOL 이월금의 증가를 초래할 경우, 해당 공제가 세금을 감면한 것으로 간주합니다. NOL에 기여하는 대손상각 공제는 NOL을 이월하는 연도의 세금을 낮추는 데 도움이 됩니다. 개인의 NOL에 대한 더 자세한 내용은 간행물 536을 참조하십시오. 또한 양식 1045의 지침 및 양식 1139의 지침을 참조하십시오.

#### 비사업 대손상각
그외 모든 대손상각은 비 사업 대손상각이며 단기 자본 손실로서 양식 8949와 스케줄 D (양식 1040)에서 공제할 수 있습니다. 비사업 대손상각에 대한 추가적인 내용은 섹션 166 및 이에 대한 규정들을 참조하십시오.
#### 자동차 및 트럭 비용
사업에서 차량이나 트럭을 사용하는 경우 차량 운영 및 유지 보수 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다. 사업상 일박 이상 거주지를 떠날 때 소요되는 현지 교통비와 출장하는 데 드는 기타 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다.
**현지 교통비.**
현지 교통비에는 다음 모든 사항에 대한 경상 및 필수 비용이 포함됩니다. 
  * 세금목적상 거주지 도시 또는 일반 지역 내에서 여행할 때 사업 또는 직업 과정에서 한 근무지에서 다른 근무지로 이동하는 것. 세금목적상 거주지는 나중에 정의됩니다.
  * 고객 또는 손님 방문.
  * 일반 근무지에서 멀리 떨어진 업무 회의에 가는 것.
  * 하나 이상의 정규 직장이 있을 때 거주지에서 임시 근무지로 이동하는 것. 이러한 임시 사업장은 세금목적상 거주지 또는 해당 지역 외부에 위치할 수 있습니다.


현지 업무 교통편에는 일박 이상 거주지를 떠나있는 동안 지출한 비용이 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 비용은 여행 비용으로 세액공제되며 나중에 [_출장 및 식대_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313566 "출장 및 식대 ")에서 논의합니다. 하지만, 일박 이상 거주지를 떠나있는 동안 차량을 이용하는 경우, 이 항목의 규칙을 사용하여 차량 비용 공제를 확인하십시오. 
일반적으로 귀하의 세금목적상 거주지는 귀하의 가정 유지 장소와 상관없이 귀하의 일반 사업장입니다. 세금목정상 거주지는 사업 또는 직장이 위치한 도시 또는 일반 지역 전체를 포함합니다.
**예.**
귀하는 임대된 사무실 공간에서 인쇄 사업을 운영하고 있습니다. 밴을 통해 고객에게 완료된 작업을 전달할 수 있습니다. 고객과 인쇄소 간의 왕복 교통비를 공제할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하의 거주지과 주 사업장 또는 일반 사업장 사이에서 차량이나 트럭을 운전하는 데 드는 비용을 공제할 수 없습니다. 이러한 비용은 개인 출퇴근 비용입니다._.
_**거주지 사무실.**_
거주지에 주 사업장으로 적합한 사무실이 있는 경우, 거주지가 직장이 될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은, 나중에 [_사업용도로 거주지 사용_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313580 "사업용도로 거주지 사용")을 참고하십시오. 
**예.**
귀하는 그래픽 디자이너입니다. 거주지에서 사업을 운영합니다. 귀하의 거주지는 주요 사업장으로서의 자격이 있습니다. 때때로 완성된 작업을 제공하기 위해 고객에게 운전해 가야 합니다. 거주지에서 고객에게 다녀올 때의 왕복 교통비를 공제할 수 있습니다.
#### 자동차 및 트럭 비용 공제 방식
현지 교통편 또는 자동차나 트럭으로 일박 여행을 하는 경우, 일반적으로 다음 방법 중 하나를 사용하여 비용을 계산할 수 있습니다.
  * 표준 마일리지 요율.
  * 실제 비용.


**표준 마일리지 요율.**
표준 마일리지 요율을 사용하여 사업용 차량, 밴, 픽업 또는 패널 트럭 운용에 대한 공제 비용을 파악할 수 있습니다. 2024년에 한 사업 용도 표준 마일리지 요율은 마일 당 67센트입니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_1년간 표준 마일리지 요율을 사용하는 경우, 업무 관련 주차 요금 및 통행료를 제외하고는 해당 연도의 실제 비용을 공제할 수 없습니다._.
_**표준 마일리지 요율 선택하기.**_
소유한 차량 또는 트럭에 대한 표준 마일리지 요율을 사용하려면, 업무에 차량을 사용할 수 있는 첫 해에 이를 선택해야 합니다. 나중에는 표준 마일리지 요율와 실제 비용 중에서 선택할 수 있습니다. 
리스 차량에 표준 마일리지 요율을 사용하는 경우, 전체 리스 기간 (갱신 포함)에 사용해야 합니다. 
_**표준 마일리지 요율은 허용되지 않는 경우.**_
다음과 같은 경우 표준 마일리지 요율은 사용할 수 없습니다. 
  1. 동시에 5대 이상의 자동차를 운행하는 경우.
  2. 정액 방식 이외의 방법을 사용하여 감가상각 공제한 경우 (예: ACRS 또는 MACRS).
  3. 차량에 대한 섹션 179 공제를 청구한 경우.
  4. 차량에 대한 특별감가상각허용을 청구한 경우.
  5. 리스한 차량에 대해 실제 차량 비용을 청구한 경우, 또는
  6. 적격 상환을 받은 시골 우편 운송 업체의 경우입니다.


_**주차비와 통행료.**_
표준 마일리지 요율 외에도 업무 관련 주차 요금 및 통행료를 공제할 수 있습니다. (직장에 차를 주차하기 위해 지불하는 주차비는 공제할 수 없는 출퇴근 비용입니다.) 
**실제 비용.**
표준 마일리지 요율 사용을 선택하지 않으면 실제 차량 또는 트럭 비용을 공제할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_만약 두 가지 방법을 모두 사용할 자격이 있다면, 공제액을 두 가지 방법으로 계산하여 둘 중 더 큰 공제액을 받을 수 있는 방법을 알아볼 수 있습니다._.
실제 차량 비용에는 다음 항목이 포함됩니다.
감가상각 | 리스 납부금 | 등록금   
---|---|---  
주차장 임대료 | 면허증 | 수리비  
기름 | 엔진오일 | 타이어  
보험료 | 주차비 | 통행료  
차량을 업무 및 개인 목적으로 사용할 경우, 비용을 업무와 개인용으로 분리해야 합니다. 각 목적에 대해 주행 거리에 따라 비용을 나눌 수 있습니다. 
**예.**
귀하는 꽃가게를 운영하는 개인 사업자입니다. 귀하는 한 해 동안 20,000 마일을 운전했습니다. 16,000 마일이 고객에게 꽃을 배달하는 데 사용되었으며 4,000 마일이 개인 용도로 사용되었습니다 (출퇴근 거리 포함). 밴 운영 비용의 80% (16,000 ÷ 20,000)만 사업 비용으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**추가 정보.**
차량 및 트럭 비용 청구 규칙에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 463을 참고하십시오.
#### 직원에게 비용 변제하기
일반적으로 차량 및 트럭 비용에 대해 직원에게 변제하는 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 공제하는 변제금과 공제 방식은 귀하가 책임 있는 플랜 또는 무책임한 플랜으로 비용을 상환하는지 여부에 따라 부분적으로 달라집니다. 자세한 내용은, 간행물 15를 참조하십시오. 이 간행물에서는 책임 플랜과 무책임한 플랜을 설명하고 직원에 대한 상환금을 직원의 양식 W-2에 신고해야 하는지 여부를 알려줍니다.
#### 감가상각
귀하의 사업체에서 사용하기 위해 취득한 자산이 1년 이상 지속될 것으로 예상되는 경우, 일반적으로 취득한 연도에 전체 비용을 사업 비용으로 공제할 수 없습니다. 과세 연도 1년 이상에 걸쳐 비용을 분산시키고 매년 그 일부를 스케줄 C에서 공제해야 합니다. 이 사업용 자산의 비용을 공제하는 방법을 감가상각이라고 합니다.
다음은 간략한 개요입니다. 감가상각에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 946에서 참고하십시오.
**어떤 자산을 감가상각할 수 있습니까?**
자산이 다음 요건을 모두 충족하는 경우 감가상각할 수 있습니다. 
  * 귀하가 소유한 자산이어야 합니다.
  * 사업에 사용하거나 소득을 창출하기 위해 보유해야 합니다. 재고자산은 절대로 감가상각할 수 없습니다 ([2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313225 "회계 기간 및 회계 방식")에서 설명됨) 귀하의 사업에 사용하기 위해 보관되지 않기 때문입니다.
  * 서비스 제공 연도를 훨씬 초과하는 유용한 수명을 가져야 합니다. 
  * 확정적인 유용한 수명을 가져야 합니다. 즉, 닳고, 썩고, 소모되고, 쓸모가 없어지거나, 자연적인 원인으로부터 그 가치를 잃는 무언가가 되어야 합니다. 토지는 닳아 없어지거나, 노후화되거나, 소모될 수 없기 때문에 토지의 비용을 절대 감가상각할 수 없습니다.
  * 예외 자산이 아니어야 합니다. 여기에는 같은 해에 처분된 서비스 및 처분된 자산이 포함됩니다.


**수리.**
일반적으로, 수리 또는 유지 보수 비용이 자산을 개선하지 않는 경우 감가상각하지 않습니다. 대신, 귀하는 스케줄 C의 라인 21에서 이러한 금액을 공제합니다. 개선은 귀하의 자산에 대한 개선, 자산의 복원하거나 귀하의 자산을 새로운 용도 또는 다른 용도로 개조하기 위해 지불하는 금액입니다. 
_**귀하의 자산을 개선하지 않는 수리 및 유지 보수 비용을 자본화하기 위한 선택.**_
거래 또는 사업에서 특정 수리 또는 교체를 감가상각의 대상이 되는 개선 사항으로 간주하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 선택은 소득과 지출을 계산하는 데 정기적으로 사용되는 장부 및 기록에서 이 금액을 자본 지출로 취급하는 경우 사용할 수 있습니다. 
**감가상각 방식.**
1986년 이후에 사용을 시작한 대부분의 사업 및 투자 자산을 감가상각하는 방법을 MACRS (수정 조기원가회수제어)라고 합니다. MACRS는 간행물 946에서 상세하게 논의합니다. 
**섹션 179 공제.**
자산을 보유한 연도에 특정 감가상각 자산 비용의 제한 금액을 공제하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 세액공제는 섹션 179 공제로 알려져 있습니다. 2024년 동안 공제할 수 있는 최대 금액은 일반적으로 $1,220,000입니다 (특정 자산에는 더 높은 한도가 적용됩니다). 
이 한도는 일반적으로 과세 연도 동안 서비스 중인 자산의 비용이 $3,050,000를 초과하는 금액만큼 감소됩니다. 2024년에 사용을 시작한 사업용 자가용에 대해 취할 수 있는 총 감가상각 금액 (섹션 179 공제 포함)은 $12,400입니다 (2024년에 사용을 시작한 적격 자가용에 대한 특별감가상각충당금을 받는 경우 $20,400). 트럭과 밴에는 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 자세한 내용은 간행물 946을 참고하십시오. 이 간행물은 공제 대상 자산이 무엇인지, 공제에 적용되는 제한이 무엇인지, 공제 환입 시기와 방법을 설명합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_스포츠 유틸리티 차량 (SUV) 및 기타 특정 차량에 대한 섹션 179의 비용은 $30,500로 제한됩니다. 자세한 내용은 양식 4562에 대한 지침 또는 간행물 946을 참고하십시오._.
**지정된 자산.**
지정된 자산을 감가상각할 때는 특별 규칙 및 기록 보관 요건을 준수해야 합니다. 지정된 자산에는 다음이 포함됩니다. 
  * 대부분의 자가용.
  * 교통에 사용되는 대부분의 기타 자산.
  * 일반적으로 엔터테인먼트, 레크리에이션 또는 유흥에 사용되는 유형의 모든 자산.

  1. 사업용으로 거주지를 사용하지 않았더라도 공제할 수 있는 비용 (예: 주택담보대출 이자, 부동산 세금, 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 항목별 공제액으로 허용되는 재해 및 도난 손실)의 사업 부분.
  2. 거주지 내 사업 활동 (예: 사업용 전화, 용품 및 장비 감가상각)과 관련된 사업 비용이지만 가정 자체의 사용과 관련이 없는 사업 비용. 


SE 세금의 1/2에 대한 공제액을 (2)에 포함하지 않습니다. 
공제액 계산을 위해 **양식 8829** , ‘사업 용도로 거주지 사용에 대한 비용’을 사용합니다. 
**간소화된 방식.**
IRS는 사업용 거주지 사용 비용을 결정하는 간소화 방식을 제공합니다. 간소화 방식은 실제 비용을 계산하고 입증에 대한 대안입니다. 대부분의 경우 공제액은 $5를 사업에 사용된 적격 거주지의 면적을 곱한 값입니다. 공제액을 구하는 데 사용하는 면적은 300 제곱 피트로 제한됩니다. 자세한 내용은 스케줄 C의 지침을 참고하십시오.
**추가 정보.**
사업용 거주지 사용 비용을 공제하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 587을 참고하십시오.
#### 유형 자산 최소허용기준 피난처
일반적으로 건물, 장비 또는 가구와 같은 거래 또는 사업에 사용되는 실물 또는 유형 개인 자산을 획득하거나 생산하기 위한 비용을 자본화해야 합니다. 그러나, 귀하가 유형 자산을 위해 최소허용기준 피난처를 사용하기로 선택한 경우, 특정 실물 자산을 취득하거나 생산하기 위해 지급한 최소허용기준 금액을 재무회계 목적이나 장부 및 기록을 보관하기 위해 공제할 수 있습니다.
해당되는 재무제표가 있는 경우 이 피난처를 사용하여 유형 자산에 대해 지급한 금액을 품목 또는 송장당 최대 $5,000까지 공제할 수 있습니다. 해당 재무제표가 없는 경우 최소허용기준 피난처를 사용하여 유형 자산에 대해 지급한 금액을 품목 또는 송장당 최대 $2,500까지 공제할 수 있습니다.
이 최소허용기준 피난처에 해당하는 금액은 스케줄 C의 파트 V에 기타 비용으로 포함되어야 합니다.

## 9. 순이익 또는 손실 계산
#### 소개
사업 소득과 비용을 계산한 이후에, 사업 순이익 또는 순손실을 계산할 수 있습니다. 사업 소득에서 사업 비용을 차감하여 계산할 수 있습니다. 비용이 소득보다 적은 경우, 그 차액은 순이익이며 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 3의 소득에 포함됩니다. 비용이 소득보다 많은 경우 차액은 순손실입니다. 일반적으로 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 3의 총소득에서 공제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 일부 상황에서는 손실이 제한됩니다. 이 장에서는 그 세 가지 상황을 간략하게 설명합니다. 손실이 제한될 수 있는 다른 상황은 스케줄 C, 라인 7과 라인 32에 대한 지침에 설명되어 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_두 개 이상의 사업체를 운영하는 경우, 각 사업체의 순이익 또는 손실을 별도의 스케줄 C를 사용해 계산합니다._.
**과도 사업 손실 제한.**
귀하의 거래 또는 사업에서 발생한 손실은 제한될 수 있습니다. 해당된다면, 양식 461을 사용해 과도 사업 손실을 판단하십시오. 귀하의 과도 사업 손실은 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 8p에 소득으로 포함될 것이며 필수적으로 다음 과세연도로 이연 및 공제해야 하는 NOL로 취급됩니다. 
과도 사업 손실 제한에 대한 더 많은 정보는 양식 461 및 이에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
#### 순영업손실 (NOL)
해당 연도의 공제액이 해당 연도의 소득보다 많은 경우 NOL이 있을 수 있습니다. NOL을 다른 연도 또는 여러 연도 소득에서 공제하여 사용할 수 있습니다.
NOL을 생성할 수 있는 일반적인 손실의 예는 다음을 포함하지만 이에 국한되지 않습니다.
  * 귀하의 거래 또는 사업.
  * 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 재해 또는 도난.
  * 이사 비용.
  * 임대 자산.


사업 운영으로 인한 손실이 NOL의 가장 일반적인 사유입니다.
NOL에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 536을 참고하십시오. NOL를 계산하는 방법, 사용 시기, NOL 공제 청구 방법 및 NOL 이월액을 구하는 방법을 설명합니다.
#### 비영리 활동
수익을 내기 위해 사업을 수행하지 않으면 공제액에 제한이 있습니다. 이러한 활동으로 인한 손실을 사용하여 기타 소득을 상쇄할 수 없습니다. 취미로 하는 활동이나 주로 스포츠 또는 레크리에이션을 위한 활동은 이 제한에 따릅니다.
비영리 활동에 대한 자세한 내용은 [취미인가 사업인가: 부업에 대해 알아두어야 할 사항을 알아보기](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/hobby-or-business-heres-what-to-know-about-that-side-hustle)를 참조하십시오.
## 10. 자영업 (SE) 세금
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_SE 세금 규정은 귀하의 나이 및 이미 사회 보장과 메디케어 혜택을 받고 있는지 여부에 관계없이 적용됩니다._.
#### SE 세금을 납부해야 하는 사람은 누구입니까?
일반적으로, 자영업의 순수입이 $400 이상인 경우 SE 세금을 납부하고 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 제출해야 합니다. 스케줄 SE를 사용하여 자영업 순수입을 계산하십시오.
**개인 사업자 또는 독립 계약자.**
개인 사업자 또는 독립 계약자로서 자영업을 영위하는 경우 일반적으로 스케줄 C (양식 1040)를 사용하여 SE 세금이 적용되는 순수입을 계산합니다.
**SE 세율.**
2024년 순수입에 대한 SE 세율은 15.3% (사회 보장세 12.4% + 메디케어세 2.9%)입니다.
**SE 세금 대상 최대 수입**
2024년 임금, 팁 및 순소득을 모두 합한 금액 중 오직 첫 $168,600 까지만 SE 세금의 사회 보장 부분 12.4%, 사회보장세 또는 철도 퇴직세 1등급의 대상입니다. 
2024년의 임금, 팁 및 순수입을 모두 합한 금액은 SE 세금의 2.9% 메디케어 부분, 메디케어 세금 또는 철도 퇴직 세금의 메디케어 부분을 조합하여 과세됩니다. 
귀하의 임금과 팁이 사회보장세 또는 철도 퇴직세의 1단계 부분 또는 둘 다의 적용을 받고 총액이 적어도 $168,600 이상인 경우, 순수입에 대한 SE 세금의 12.4% 사회 보장 부분을 납부하지 않습니다. 그러나 모든 순수입에 대해 SE 세금의 메디케어 부분 2.9%는 납부해야 합니다.
**추가 메디케어 세금.**
자영업의 순이익이 임계값 금액을 초과하는 경우 0.9%의 추가 메디케어 세금이 적용될 수 있습니다 (납세자 구분에 따라 다름). 자세한 내용은 1장에서 [_자영업 (SE) 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p334ko#en_US_2024_publink1000313194 "자영업 \(SE\) 세금")과 양식 8959 및 이의 지침에서 확인하십시오.
#### 특별 규칙 및 예외 사항
**체류자**
일반적으로 거주자는 미국 시민에게 적용되는 동일한 규칙에 따라 SE 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 비거주자는 국제 사회 보장 계약 또는 보험료 면제 협정 (totalization agreement)이 미국 사회 보장 플랜의 적용을 받는다고 결정하지 않는 한 SE 세금의 대상이 아닙니다. 그러나 미국 버진 아일랜드, 푸에르토리코, 괌, 북마리아나 플랜 연방, 또는 미국령 사모아 거주자는 SE 세금 목적에서 미국 거주자로 간주되기 때문에 SE 세금이 부과됩니다. 체류자에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 519, ‘미국 체류자에 대한 세금 안내’를 참고하십시오.
**부모가 고용한 자녀.**
귀하가 만 18세 미만이고 귀하의 아버지 또는 어머니를 위해 일하는 경우 귀하는 SE 세금의 대상이 아닙니다.
**교회 직원.**
귀하가 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금 면제를 선택한 교회 또는 적격 교회 관리 조직 (목사, 종교 교단 또는 크리스쳔 사이언스 교인 제외)에서 일하는 경우, 교회 또는 조직으로부터 $108.28 이상의 임금을 받는 경우 SE 세금이 부과됩니다. 자세한 내용은, 간행물 517, ‘성직자 및 종교 근로자를 위한 사회 보장 및 기타 정보’를 참고하십시오.
**어선원.**
귀하가 어류나 다른 수산물을 잡는 배의 선원인 경우, 다음 조건이 모두 적용되는 경우 귀하의 수입에 SE 세금이 부과됩니다.
  1. 보수가 아래의 조건을 모두 충족하지 않는 한 어획물에서 자신의 몫 또는 어획물 판매 수익의 몫을 제외하고는 작업에 대한 보수를 받지 않습니다.
    1. 보수는 여정당 $100를 넘지 않습니다.
    2. 보수는 최소 어획물이 있는 경우에만 지급됩니다.
    3. 이 급여는 오로지 수산업에서 전통적으로 추가 현금 급여가 적용되는 대한 추가 업무 (예: 동료, 엔지니어 또는 요리사)에 대한 것입니다.
  2. 귀하는 어획물에서 자신의 몫을 얻거나 어획물 판매 수익에서 몫을 얻습니다.
  3. 몫은 어획량에 따라 달라집니다.
  4. 배의 운항 선원은 보통 10명 미만입니다. (지난 4분기 동안 운행의 평균 선원 규모가 10명 미만인 경우 운영 선원은 일반적으로 10명 미만으로 구성됩니다.)


**공증인.**
공증인으로서 귀하가 수행하는 서비스에 대해 받는 수수료는 스케줄 C에서 신고하지만 SE 세금이 적용되지 않습니다 (스케줄 SE (양식 1040)에 대한 지침 참조).
**주 또는 지방 정부 직원.**
귀하가 주 또는 지방 정부의 직원이고 수수료 기반의 지급만 받으며 귀하의 서비스가 연방-주 사회 보장 합의에 따라 보장되지 않는 경우 SE 세금의 대상이 됩니다.
**외국 정부 또는 국제기구 직원.**
다음 두 조건이 모두 충족되는 경우 SE 세금의 대상입니다.
  1. 귀하는 미국 시민이며 미국, 푸에르토리코, 괌, 미국령 사모아, 북마리아나 플랜 연방, 또는 미국 버진 아일랜드내의 
    1. 외국 정부,
    2. 외국 정부가 전적으로 소유한 기관, 또는
    3. 국제기구의 직원입니다.
  2. 귀하의 고용주는 귀하의 임금에서 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금을 원천 징수할 필요가 없습니다.


**해외에 체류하는 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인.**
미국 이외의 지역에 거주하는 자영업자 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인의 경우 대부분의 경우 SE 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 자영업 세금을 계산할때 자영업에 의한 해외 소득에서 귀하의 해외 근로 소득을 차감할 수 없습니다.
_**예외.**_
미국은 많은 국가와 사회보장 협정을 맺어 두 가지 사회 보장 플랜 하에서 이중과세를 없애고 있습니다. 이러한 협정에 따라, 귀하는 일반적으로 귀하가 거주하는 국가에만 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 세금을 납부해야 하는 국가는 다른 국가의 사회보장세 면제를 증명하는 증명서를 발급합니다.
자세한 내용은 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
#### 두 개 이상의 사업체
두 개 이상의 거래, 사업 또는 직업 중 SE 세금이 적용되는 소득이 있는 경우, 각 소득에서 발생하는 순이익 (또는 손실)을 합산하여 SE 세금이 적용되는 총수입을 결정해야 합니다. 한 사업에서 손실을 입으면 다른 사업에서 얻는 이익이 줄어듭니다.
#### 부부 공동 재산 소득
파트너쉽을 제외한 거래 또는 사업 소득 중 어느 하나가 주 법률에 따른 부부 공동 재산 소득인 경우, 이는 거래 또는 사업 수행 배우자의 SE 세금이 적용되는 소득에 포함됩니다.
#### 손익
사업 자산이 아니며 일반적으로 고객에게 판매하기 위해 보유한 것도 아닌 자산 처분으로 인한 손익을 SE 세금의 적용 대상인 소득에 포함하지 않습니다. 처분이 매각, 교환 또는 비자발적 전환인지 여부는 중요하지 않습니다.
#### 손실 소득 지급금
귀하가 자영업자이고 사업 활동을 줄이거나 중단하는 경우, 손실된 사업 소득에 대해 보험 또는 기타 출처로부터 받는 모든 지급금은 SE 세금이 적용되는 소득에 포함됩니다. 지급금을 받을 당시 근무하지 않는 경우에도 사업과 관련이 있으며 사업이 일시적으로 비활성 상태인 경우에도 SE 세금이 적용되는 수입에 포함됩니다.
#### SE 세금 대상 수입 계산
#### 순수입을 계산하는 방법
자영업 순수입을 계산하는 세 가지 방법이 있습니다.
  1. 정규 방법.
  2. 비농업 선택적 방법.
  3. 농업 선택적 방법.


선택적 방법 중 하나 또는 둘 다를 사용하지 않는 범위 내에서 정규 방법을 사용해야 합니다.
**선택적 방법을 사용하는 이유는 무엇입니까?**
손실이 있거나 적은 순이익이 있으며 다음 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 선택적 방법 (나중에 논의)을 사용할 수 있습니다.
  * 사회 보장 혜택 적용 범위에 대한 적립 혜택을 받고자 하는 경우.
  * 세액공제를 청구할 수 있는 자녀 또는 부양 가족 탁아 비용이 발생한 경우. (선택적 방법으로 근로 소득이 증가하여 세액공제 금액이 많아질 수 있습니다.)
  * 근로 소득 세액공제를 받을 수 있는 경우. (선택적 방법으로 근로 소득이 증가하여 세액공제 금액이 증가할 수 있습니다.)
  * 추가 자녀 세액공제를 받을 수 있는 경우. (선택적 방법으로 근로 소득이 증가하여 세액공제 금액이 증가할 수 있습니다.)


**선택적 방법 사용의 효과.**
선택적 방법을 사용하면 SE 세금이 증가할 수 있습니다. SE 세금을 더 내면 은퇴할 때 더 높은 혜택을 받을 수 있습니다.
선택적 방법을 사용하면 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 SE 세금의 2분의 1 공제 때문에 AGI가 감소할 수 있으며, 이는 AGI 한도가 적용되는 공제 또는 기타 항목의 자격에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 선택적 방법이 귀하에게 도움이 되는지 확인하기 위해 선택적 방법을 사용하거나 사용하지 않고 AGI를 파악합니다. 
선택적 방법 한 가지 또는 두 가지 방법을 모두 사용하는 경우, 정규 방법을 사용하여 더 작은 세금을 내거나 세금을 내지 않더라도 이 방법으로 SE 세금을 납부해야 합니다.
선택적 방법은 SE 세금 계산에만 사용할 수 있습니다. 소득세를 계산하려면 SE 세금을 결정하는 데 사용하는 방법에 관계없이 총소득에 실제 수입을 포함합니다.
#### 정규 방법
정규 방법을 사용하여 순수입을 계산하려면 자영업 소득에 92.35% (0.9235)를 곱합니다. 정규 방법을 사용하여 순수입을 계산하려면 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)의 라인 4a를 참고하십시오.
정규 방법을 사용하여 파악한 순수입은 실제 순수입이라고도 합니다.
#### 비농업 선택적 방법
비농업 선택적 방법은 농업에서 발생하지 않는 수입에만 사용합니다. 귀하는 다음 기준을 모두 충족하는 경우 이 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다.
  1. 귀하는 정기적으로 자영업을 하고 있습니다. 즉, 이 방법을 사용하기 전의 과세 연도 3년 중 최소 2년 동안 자영업의 실제 순수입이 $400 이상인 경우입니다. 이를 위한 전년도 순수입은 농업 또는 비농업 수입 또는 둘 다일 수 있습니다.
  2. 이 방법을 5년 미만 사용했습니다. (평생 5년의 제한이 있습니다.) 연도가 연이어 있을 필요는 없습니다.
  3. 귀하의 비농업 순이익은
    1. $7,493 미만,
    2. 비농업 총소득의 72.189% 미만입니다.


**비농업 순이익.**
비농업 순이익은 일반적으로 다음 금액의 합계입니다.
  * 스케줄 C (양식 1040)의 라인 31, 및
  * 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065)의 박스 14, 코드 A (비농업 파트너쉽).


그러나 귀하가 일반 파트너이거나 손실인 경우 스케줄 K-1에 신고한 금액을 조정해야 할 수 있습니다.
**비농업 총소득.**
비농업 총소득은 일반적으로 다음 금액의 합계입니다.
  * 스케줄 C (양식 1040)의 라인 7, 및
  * 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065)의 박스 14, 코드 C (비농업 파트너쉽).


#### 비농업 순수입 계산
앞서 설명한 세 가지 기준을 충족하는 경우, 다음 표를 사용하여 비농업 선택적 방법에 따른 자영업의 비농업 순수입을 계산합니다.
**표 . 표 10-1. 비농업 순수입 계산**
귀하의 비농업 총소득이 다음과 같다면 | 순수입은 다음과 같습니다.  
---|---  
$10,380 이하 | 비농업 총소득의 2/3.  
$10,380 초과 | $7,493.  
**선택적 순수입은 실제 순수입보다 적은 경우**
이 방법을 사용하여 자영업의 비농업 순수입보다 적은 금액을 신고할 수 없습니다. 실제 비농업 순수입은 앞서 설명한 정규 방법을 사용하여 파악한 비농업 순수입입니다.
**비농업 총소득 $10,380 이하.**
다음 예는 비농업 총소득이 $10,380 이하일 때 순이익을 계산하는 방법을 보여줍니다.
**예시 1. 비농업 순이익은 $7,493 미만이고 비농업 총소득의 72.189% 미만인 경우.**
귀하는 공예 사업을 운영하고 있습니다. 자영업에 대한 실제 순수입은 2022년 $800, 2023년 $900입니다. 그녀는 정기적으로 자영업을하는 기준을 충족합니다. 비농업 선택적 방법을 5년 미만 사용했습니다. 2024년 총소득과 순수익은 다음과 같습니다. 
비농업 총소득 | $5,400  
---|---  
비농업 순이익 | $1,200  
귀하의 2024년 실제 순수입은 $1,108 ($1,200 × 0.9235)입니다. 순이익은 $7,493 미만이고 총소득의 72.189% 미만이기 때문에 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용하여 $3,600 (2/3 × $5,400)의 순수입을 계산할 수 있습니다. 이 순수입은 실제 순수입보다 높기 때문에 2024년 순수입을 $3,600로 신고할 수 있습니다.
**예시 2. 비농업 순이익은 $7,493 미만이지만 비농업 총소득의 72.189% 미만이 아닙니다.**
이전의 _예 1_ 에서, 귀하의 총소득은 $1,200이고 순수익은 $900라고 가정합니다. 순이익을 계산하려면 정규 방법을 사용해야 합니다. 순이익은 총소득의 72.189% 미만이기 때문에 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용할 수 없습니다.
**예시 3. 비농업 사업으로 인한 순손실.**
이전의 _예 1_ 에서, 귀하의 순손실은 $700라고 가정합니다. 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용하고 $3,600 (2/3 × $5,400)를 순수입으로 신고할 수 있습니다.
**예시 4. 비농업 순수입은 $400 미만입니다.**
이전의 _예 1_ 에서, 귀하의 총소득은 $525이고 순이익은 $175라고 가정합니다. 이 상황에서, 귀하는 정규 방법 또는 비농업 선택적 방법으로 SE 세금을 지급하지 않을 것입니다. 왜냐하면 두 방법 모두에 따른 순수입은 $400 미만이기 때문입니다.
**비농업 총소득은 $10,380을 초과합니다.**
다음 예는 비농업 총소득이 $10,380를 초과할 때 순이익을 계산하는 방법을 보여줍니다.
**예시 1. 비농업 순이익은 $7,493 미만이고 비농업 총소득의 72.189% 미만입니다.**
귀하는 가전제품 수리점을 운영하고 있습니다. 자영업의 실제 순수입은 2022년 10,500, 2023년 $9,500입니다. 귀하는 정기적으로 자영업을하는 기준을 충족합니다. 비농업 선택적 방법을 5년 미만 사용했습니다. 2024년 총소득과 순이익은 다음과 같습니다.
비농업 총소득 | $12,000  
---|---  
비농업 순이익 | $1,200  
귀하의 2024년 실제 순수입은 $1,108 ($1,200 × 0.9235)입니다. 순이익은 $7,493 미만이고 총소득의 72.189% 미만이기 때문에 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용하여 순수입 $6,920을 파악할 수 있습니다. 이 순수입은 실제 순수입보다 높기 때문에 2024년 순수입을 $6,920으로 신고할 수 있습니다.
**예 2. 비농업 순이익은 $7,493 이상입니다.**
이전의 _예 1_ 에서 귀하의 순이익은 $8,900로 가정합니다. 귀하는 정규 방법을 사용해야 합니다. 비농업 순소득은 $7,493미만이기 때문에 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용할 수 없습니다.
**예 3. 비농업 사업으로 인한 순손실.**
이전의 _예 1_ 에서, 귀하의 순손실은 $700라고 가정합니다. 비농업 선택적 방법을 사용하고 $6,920을 자영업 순수입으로 신고할 수 있습니다.
#### 농업 선택적 방법
농업 선택적 방법을 농업 사업의 수입에만 사용합니다. 이 방법에 대한 정보는 간행물 225를 참고하십시오.
#### 두가지 선택적 방법 모두 사용
농업 소득과 비농업 소득이 두가지 모두 있는 경우, 두 가지 선택적 방법을 사용하여 자영업 순수입을 판단할 수 있습니다.
두 가지 선택적 방법을 사용하여 순수입을 계산하려면 다음 작업을 수행해야 합니다.
  * 각 방법에 따라 농업 및 비농업 순수입을 별도로 계산합니다. 순수입을 파악하기 위해 어떤 방법에서든 농업 수입과 비농업 수입을 합산하지 않습니다.
  * 각 방법 아래에 표시된 순수입을 추가하여 자영업의 총순수입을 구합니다.


실제 농업 및 비농업 전체 순수입보다 적게 신고할 수 있지만 실제 비농업 순수입보다 적게 신고할 수는 없습니다. 두 가지 선택적 방법을 모두 사용하는 경우, 자영업 순수입을 합산한 금액은 $6,920을 초과하지 않습니다. 
**예시.**
귀하는 자영업 농부입니다. 귀하는 소매 식료품점도 운영합니다. 총소득, 자영업의 실제 순수입, 자영업의 선택적 농업 및 선택적 비농업 순수입은 표 10-2에 표시됩니다.
**표 . 표 10-2. 예시-농업 및 비농업 수입**
소득 및 수입 | 농업 | 비농업  
---|---|---  
총소득 | $4,500 | $6,000  
실제 순수입 | $900 | $500  
선택적 순수입 (총소득의 2/3 ) | $3,000 | $4,000  
표 10-3은 다음과 같은 표 10-2에 보여진 농업 및 비농업 총소득과 실제 순수입을 사용하여 자영업의 순수입을 계산하는 데 사용할 수 있는 네 가지 방법 또는 방법의 조합을 보여줍니다.
  * 방법 1. 농업 소득과 비농업 소득 모두에 대해 정규 방법을 사용합니다.
  * 방법 2. 농업 소득에 대해 선택적 방법을 사용하고 비농업 소득에 대해 정규 방법을 사용합니다.
  * 방법 3. 농업 소득에 대해 정규 방법을 사용하고 비농업 소득에 대해 선택적 방법을 사용합니다.
  * 방법 4. 농업 소득과 비농업 소득 모두에 대해 선택적 방법을 사용합니다.


**비고.** 실제 순수입은 정규 방법을 사용하여 파악한 순수입과 동일합니다. 
**표 . 표 10-3. 예시-순수입**
**순수입** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4**  
---|---|---|---|---  
실제 농업 | $900 |  | $900 |   
선택적 농업 |  | $3,000 |  | $3,000  
실제 비농업 | $500 | $500 |  |   
선택적 비농업 |  |  | $4,000 | $4,000  
**신고할 수 있는 금액:** | **$1,400** | **$3,500** | **$4,900** | **$6,920***  
*두 가지 선택적 방법을 모두 사용했기 때문에 $6,920로 제한됩니다.

**공동 신고서.**
공동 신고서를 제출하더라도 스케줄 SE는 공동으로 제출할 수 없습니다. 이는 배우자 중 한 명 또는 두 명 모두 SE 세금의 대상이 되는 소득이 있는 경우입니다. 두 사람 모두 SE 세금이 적용되는 수입이 있는 경우, 각각 별도의 스케줄 SE를 작성해야 합니다. 공동 신고서에 스케줄 두 개를 모두 첨부하십시오.
**두 개 이상의 사업체.**
두 개 이상의 거래 또는 사업체를 운영하는 경우, SE 세금을 파악하기 위해 각 사업체의 순이익 또는 손실을 반드시 결합해야 합니다. 한 사업에서 손실을 입으면 다른 사업에서 얻는 이익이 줄어듭니다. 하나의 스케줄 SE를 제출하여 자영업의 수입을 보여줄 수 있지만, 각 사업체에 대한 별도의 스케줄 C 또는 F를 제출해야 합니다. 
**예.**
귀하는 두 개의 별도 사업체를 운영하는 개인 사업자입니다. 귀하는 순이익이 $25,000인 레스토랑을 운영합니다. 귀하는 순손실이 $500인 캐비넷 제작 사업도 하고 있습니다. 귀하는 순이익이 $25,000인 레스토랑에 대한 스케줄 C, 순손실이 $500인 캐비닛 제작 사업에 대한 또 다른 스케줄 C를 제출해야 합니다. $24,500의 SE 세금이 적용되는 총수입을 나타내는 하나의 스케줄 SE를 제출합니다.
## 11. 납세자로서의 권리
이 장은 세무조사, 항소, 징수 및 환급 절차에 대해 설명합니다.
#### 세무조사, 항소, 징수 및 환급
**세무조사 (감사).**
본기관은 대부분의 납세자의 신고서를 제출된 상태 그대로 처리합니다. 귀하의 신고서에 대해 문의하거나 조사를 위해 선택한 경우, 귀하가 정직하지 않다는 것을 의미하지는 않습니다. 문의 또는 세무조사를 통해 더 많은 세금이 부과될 수도 있고 아닐 수도 있습니다. 변경 없이 사건을 종료하거나 환급을 받을 수 있습니다.
세무조사를 위한 신고서를 선택하는 과정은 일반적으로 두 가지 방법 중 하나로 시작됩니다. 한가지 방법은, 본기관은 컴퓨터 프로그램을 사용하여 잘못된 금액이 있을 가능성이 있는 신고서를 찾습니다. 이러한 프로그램은 양식 1099 및 W-2와 같은 정보 신고서, 과거 조사 연구 또는 기타 특별 프로젝트에 의해 식별된 특정 문제에 기반할 수 있습니다. 또 다른 방법은 신고서에 잘못된 금액이 있을 수 있을 가능성을 나타내는 준수 프로젝트의 정보를 사용합니다. 이러한 출처에는 신문, 공개 기록 및 개인이 포함될 수 있습니다. 정보가 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있다고 판단되는 경우, 본기관은 해당 정보를 사용하여 세무조사를 위한 신고서를 선택할 수 있습니다. 
간행물 556, ’세무조사, 항소 권리 및 환급 청구’는 본기관이 세무조사 도중 따르는 규칙 및 절차에 대해 설명합니다. 다음 항목에서는 세무조사를 실시하는 방법에 대한 개요를 제공합니다.
_**서신.**_
많은 세무조사 및 문의를 우편으로 처리합니다. 추가 정보 요청 또는 신고서 변경이 필요하다고 판단되는 사유가 포함된 서신을 보냅니다. 우편으로 응답하거나 조사관이 개인 면담을 요청할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 요청된 정보를 우편으로 보내거나 설명을 제공하는 경우, 본기관은 이에 동의할 수도 있고 동의하지 않을 수도 있으며, 변경 이유를 설명할 것입니다. 이해하지 못하는 사항에 대해 주저하지 말고 연락하십시오.
_**면담.**_
본기관이 개인 면담을 통해 세무조사를 실시할 것이라고 귀하에게 통지하거나 귀하가 그러한 면담을 요청하는 경우, 귀하는 귀하와 IRS 모두에게 편리하고 합리적인 시간과 장소에서 세무조사를 실시하도록 요청할 권리가 있습니다. 조사관이 신고서에 대한 변경 사항을 제안하는 경우, 조사관은 변경 이유를 설명할 것입니다. 이러한 변경 사항에 동의하지 않으면 조사관의 상사를 만날 수 있습니다.
_**반복된 세무조사.**_
지난 2년 중 한 해에 동일한 항목을 세무조사하고 세금을 변경하지 않겠다고 제안한 경우, 가능한 한 빨리 본기관에 연락하여 조사를 중단해야 하는지 확인하십시오. 
**항소.**
조사관의 제안된 변경 사항에 동의하지 않으면 IRS 독립 항소 사무소에 이의를 제기할 수 있습니다. 대부분의 의견 차이는 비싸고 시간이 오래 걸리는 법원 재판 없이 해결될 수 있습니다. 항소 권리는 간행물 5, ’항소 권리 및 동의하지 않을 경우 불복을 준비하는 방법’ 과 간행물 556에 자세히 설명되어 있습니다.
항소국의 이용을 원치 않거나 조사 결과에 동의하지 않는 경우, 귀하의 사건을 미국 조세 법원, 미국 연방 청구 법원 또는 귀하가 거주하는 미국 지방 법원으로 송치할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 사건을 법원에 송치하는 경우, 귀하가 납세 의무를 입증할 수 있는 충분한 기록을 보관했고 IRS과 협력했으며 기타 특정 조건을 충족하는 경우 특정 사실에 대한 입증책임은 IRS에게 있습니다. 귀하의 사건의 대부분의 사안에 대해 법원이 귀하와 동의를 하며 본기관의 입장이 크게 부당하다고 판정하는 경우, 귀하는 행정 및 소송 비용의 일부를 회수할 수 있습니다. 항소 시스템을 포함한 사안의 행정적 해결을 시도했으며 사안을 해결하는 데 필요한 정보를 모두 제공한 경우를 제외하고는 이러한 비용을 회수할 수 없습니다. 
**징수.**
간행물 594, ’IRS 징수 절차’는 연방세 납부와 관련한 귀하의 권리와 책임에 대해 설명합니다. 다음과 같은 내용을 기술하고 있습니다.
  * 납부해야 할 세금이 있을때 취해야 할 조치. 세금 청구서를 받으면 어떻게 해야 하는지, 청구서가 잘못되었다고 생각되면 어떻게 해야 하는지 설명합니다. 또한 할부 납부, 징수 조치 지연 및 세액 조정 제안 제출에 대해서도 다루고 있습니다.
  * IRS 징수 조치. 선취권, 선취권 해제, 압류, 압류 해제, 압류 및 판매, 자산 해제에 대해 다룹니다.
  * IRS는 심각한 연체 세금 채무를 국무부에 제출하며, 이는 일반적으로 여권 신청을 거부하고 여권을 취소할 수 있습니다.


징수 항소 권리는 간행물 1660, ‘징수 항소 권리’에 자세히 설명되어 있습니다. 
**무고한 배우자 구제.**
일반적으로 귀하와 배우자 모두 공동 신고서에 따른 세금, 이자 또는 과징금 전액을 납부할 책임이 있습니다. 배우자 (또는 전 배우자)와 관련된 책임으로부터 구제를 받으려면 반드시 양식 8857, ‘무고한 배우자 구제 요청’을 제출하십시오. 경우에 따라 IRS가 처음 세금을 징수하려고 시도한 날로부터 2년 이내에 양식 8857을 제출해야 할 수 있습니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR과 양식 8857을 제출하지 마십시오. 자세한 내용은, 간행물 971, ’무고한 배우자 구제’ 및 양식 8857을 참조하거나 무료 전화 855-851-2009로 무고한 배우자 사무실에 전화할 수 있습니다. 
**제삼자 접촉 가능성.**
일반적으로 IRS는 귀하 또는 귀하의 정당한 대변인을 직접 상대합니다. 그러나 사용자가 제공하지 못했거나 받은 정보를 확인하기 위해 정보가 필요한 경우 다른 사람과 이야기하는 경우가 있습니다. 본기관이 이웃, 은행, 고용주 또는 직원과 같은 다른 사람에게 연락하는 경우 일반적으로 귀하의 이름과 같은 제한된 정보를 알리게 됩니다. 법에 따라 본기관은 찾고 있는 정보를 얻거나 확인하는 데 필요한 정보 이상을 공개할 수 없습니다. 귀하의 사건에 활동이 있는 한 다른 사람에게 연락해야 할 수 있습니다. 본기관이 다른 사람에게 연락하는 경우, 귀하는 연락받은 사람들의 목록을 요청할 권리가 있습니다. 귀하는 이 정보를 전화, 서면 또는 개인 면담 중에 요청할 수 있습니다.
**환급.**
세금을 너무 많이 냈다고 생각되면 환급을 청구할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 최초 신고일로부터 3년 이내 또는 세금 납부일로부터 2년 이내 중 더 늦은 날까지 청구해야 합니다. 간행물 556에 환급에 대한 자세한 정보가 있습니다.
받을 환급이 있지만 신고서를 제출하지 않은 경우, 세금을 납부한 후로부터 2년 이내에 환급 청구서를 제출해야 환급을 받을 수 있습니다. 법은 일반적으로 귀하가 신고서를 제출 또는 환급 청구서를 제출한 날로부터 45일 이내에 환급 이뤄지지 않은 경우 귀하의 환급에 대한 이자를 제공합니다.

### 비고.
IRS는 최신 암호화 기술을 사용하여 IRS2Go 앱을 이용한 온라인, 전화 또는 모바일 장치를 통한 전자 납부가 안전하게 이루어지도록 합니다. 전자 납부는 수표나 우편환을 우편으로 보내는 것보다 빠르고 간편하며 빠릅니다.
