간행물 출판 이후에 제정된 법률을 비롯한 이 간행물 596의 진전 사항에 관한 최신 정보는 [IRS.gov/Pub596](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-596)을 참고하십시오.
### EIC란 무엇입니까?
EIC는 근로 소득이 $66,819 미만인 특정 사람들을 위한 세액공제입니다. 세액공제는 일반적으로 귀하가 더 많은 돈을 절약할 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 납부해야 하는 세금의 양을 줄일 수 있습니다. EIC는 또한 귀하에게 환급을 제공할 수 있습니다.
### EIC를 청구할 수 있습니까?
EIC를 청구하기 위해서는 특정 규칙을 충족해야 합니다. 그 규칙은 표 1에 요약되어 있습니다.
**표 . 표 1. 근로 소득 세액공제 요약**
**먼저 이 열에 있는 모든 규칙을 충족해야 합니다.** | **둘째, 아래 중 한 열의 모든 규칙을 충족해야 합니다.** | **셋째, 이 열의 규칙을 충족해야 합니다.**

### 이 간행물이 필요합니까?
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출하는 특정 사용자는 EIC를 적격 여부를 확인할 때 양식 1040 지침의 2단계 대신 이 간행물의 작업표 1을 반드시 사용해야 합니다. 다음 중 2024년도에 해당하는 내용이 있다면 작업표 1을 사용해야 합니다.
  * 스케줄 E (양식 1040)를 제출함.
  * 거래 또는 사업에 사용되지 않은 개인 자산의 대여로 인한 소득을 신고함.
  * 양식 8814 (자녀의 이자 및 배당금 신고에 대한 선택과 관련된)의 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 8z에 소득을 신고함.
  * 피동적 활동에 대한 소득 또는 손실이 있음.
  * 양식 4797의 금액이 포함된 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 7에 금액을 신고함.


위의 설명 중 어느 것도 귀하에게 해당되지 않는 경우, 귀하의 세금 양식의 지침에 EIC를 청구하고 EIC를 산정하는 데 필요한 모든 정보가 있을 수 있습니다. 이 간행물이 필요하지 않을 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 간행물을 통해 EIC 적격 여부와 EIC에 대해 자세히 알아볼 수 있습니다.
### EIC에 적격하려면 자녀가 있어야 합니까?
아니요. 최소 만 25세 이상 만 65세 미만이며 근로 소득이 $18,591 미만이라면 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $25,511) 적격 자녀 없이 EIC에 대한 자격이 있습니다. [3장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298552 "적격 자녀가 없는 경우의 규칙")을 보십시오.
### EIC 금액을 어떻게 산정합니까?
EIC를 청구할 수 있는 경우 IRS가 세액공제를 산정하도록 하거나 본인이 직접 산정할 수 있습니다. 본인이 직접 산정하려면 제출하는 양식에 대한 지침에 따라 작업표를 작성하면 됩니다. IRS가 산정하도록 하는 방법을 알아보려면 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298597 "EIC 산정 및 청구")을 보십시오.

### 알림
**단독 EIC.** 귀하의 적격 자녀가 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 2024년에 다른 사람의 적격 자녀로 취급되는 경우, 3장에 나오는 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자에 대한 규칙을 사용하면 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**적격 자녀가 있다면 스케줄 EIC (양식 1040)를 제출하십시오.** EIC 청구 목적의 조건을 갖춘 한명 이상의 적격 자녀가 있다면, 이 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없더라도, 스케줄 EIC를 작성하여 양식 1040 또는 1040–SR에 첨부하십시오. 적격 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없을 경우 스케줄 EIC를 작성하는 방법을 비롯한 더 자세한 정보는 스케줄 EIC를 참고하십시오.
**특정 공동 신고서에 대한 증가된 EIC.** 공동 신고서를 제출하는 기혼자는 소득은 같지만 납세자 구분이 다른 사람보다 EIC를 더 많이 받을 수 있습니다. 그 결과, 부부 공동 신고하는 경우는 다른 사람들과 EIC 표에서 사용하는 열이 다릅니다. EIC 표에서 귀하의 EIC를 찾을 때, 본인에게 해당하는 납세자 구분 및 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀 수에 맞는 올바른 열을 사용해야 합니다.
**별거하는 부부.** 기혼이지만 공동 신고를 하지 않는더라도 EIC를 청구할 자격이 있을 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 _[규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다,](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297448 "규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다")_ 를 참고하십시오.
**EIC는 특정 복지 혜택에 영향을 미치지 않습니다.** 연방 프로그램 또는 전체 또는 부분적으로 연방 기금을 조달한 주/지방 프로그램에 따라 귀하 또는 다른 사람의 혜택이나 지원 적격 여부 또는 지원 금액을 결정할 때, EIC로 인해 받는 모든 환급은 소득으로 계산될 수 없습니다. 이러한 프로그램에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
  * 빈곤 가정 임시 지원 (TANF).
  * 메디케이드.
  * 보충적 사회 보장 수당 (SSI).
  * 영양 보충 지원 프로그램 (푸드 스탬프).
  * 저소득층 주택.


또한, 자격 여부를 판단할 때, 환급금은 이를 수령한 후 최소 12개월 동안은 자산으로 계산할 수 없습니다. 환급이 추후 각종 다른 혜택에 영향을 미치는지 확인하려면 현지 혜택 지급 담당자에게 문의하십시오.
**메디케이드 포기 지급금.** EIC 목적 상 메디케이드 포기 지급금이 처리되는 방식이 변경에 대한 내용은 _[근로 소득](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298602 "근로 소득")_ 을 참고하십시오.
**주 세액공제를 간과하지 마십시오.** 연방 개인 소득세 신고서에 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 경우, 주 또는 지방 소득 신고에서도 이와 유사한 세액공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 주 EIC를 제공하는 주 목록은 [IRS.gov/EITC](https://www.irs.gov/ko/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc)를 참고하십시오.
**IRS가 의문을 제기한 EIC.** IRS는 EIC 청구 자격을 증명하는 서류를 제공하도록 귀하에게 요청할 수 있습니다. 어떤 문서를 보내야 하는지 알려드리겠습니다. 여기에는 출생증명서, 학교 기록 등이 포함될 수 있습니다. 자격 요건을 확인하는 과정에서 환급이 지연될 수 있습니다.
**간행물 596의 스페인어 버전.** 간행물 596(SP) Crédito por Ingreso del Trabajo는 스페인어로 번역된 간행물 596입니다. [IRS.gov/Pub596SP(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-596)를 참고하십시오. 또는 [_양식 및 간행물 주문_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink100059459 "세금 양식, 지침, 간행물 주문하기.") 이나 [_세금 관련 도움을 받는 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298717sy)을 추후에 참조하여 이 양식 및 기타 IRS 양식 및 간행물을 주문하는 방법을 알아보십시오.

## 1. 모두에게 적용되는 규칙
이 장에서는 규칙 1에서 7에 대해 다룹니다. EIC를 받으려면 7가지 규칙을 모두 충족해야 합니다. 7가지 규칙을 모두 충족하지 않으면 이 세액공제를 받을 수 없으며 나머지 간행물을 읽을 필요가 없습니다.
이 장의 7가지 규칙을 모두 충족하는 경우, 2장 또는 3장 (해당 사항)을 읽어 더 많은 규칙을 충족해야 합니다.
#### 규칙 1-조정총소득 (AGI) 한도
귀하의 조정총소득 (AGI)은 다음보다 낮아야 합니다.
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 3명 이상일 경우, $59,899 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $66,819),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 2명 이상일 경우 $55,768 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $62,688),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 한 명일 경우, $49,084 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $56,004),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 없을 경우, $18,591 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $25,511).


**조정총소득 (AGI).**
AGI는 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 11의 금액입니다. 
AGI가 위에 나열된 해당 한도 이상이면 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이 간행물의 나머지 부분을 읽을 필요가 없습니다.
**예시-AGI가 한도를 초과함.**
귀하의 AGI는 $53,000이며, 미혼이고 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 한 명 있습니다. AGI가 $49,084 이상이기 때문에 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 그러나 납세자 구분이 부부 공동 신고가고 AGI가 $56,004 미만이면 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**공동 재산.**
기혼이지만 별거 중인 기혼 납세자에 대한 특별 규칙에 따라 세대주 또는 부부 개별 신고로서 제출할 자격이 있으며 ([규칙 3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297448 "규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다") 참조), 부부 공동 재산법이 있는 주에서 거주하는 경우, 총소득에 포함되어야 하는 귀하와 배우자의 임금이 모두 AGI에 포함됩니다. 이는 아래 _규칙 7_ 에 적용되는 부부 공동 재산 규칙과는 다릅니다. 
#### 규칙 2–유효한 사회 보장 번호 (SSN)가 있어야 합니다
EIC를 청구하려면, 귀하 (및 귀하의 배우자, 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우)는 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함)까지 사회보장국 (SSA)에서 발급한 유효한 SSN이 있어야 합니다.
귀하의 적격 자녀가 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함)까지 반드시 유효한 SSN이 있어야 귀하가 이 자녀를 통해 보다 높은 EIC 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. EIC 청구 목적의 조건을 갖춘 한명 이상의 적격 자녀가 있지만, 이 자녀가 2024년 세금 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함)까지 유효한 SSN이 없더라도, EIC 대한 자격이 있다면 단독 EIC를 청구할 자격이 있을 수 있습니다. 적격 자녀가 세금 신고서 마감일까지 유효한 SSN이 없을 경우 스케줄 EIC를 작성하는 방법을 보려면 스케줄 EIC를 참고하십시오.
SSN이 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함)이후에 발급되었거나, 오직 연방 지원 혜택을 신청 또는 받기 위한 목적으로만 발급되었거나, 취업에 유효하지 않은 경우를 제외하곤 SSN은 유효합니다. 연방에서 지원하는 혜택의 예는 메디케이드입니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하, 배우자 또는 자녀가 “Not valid for employment” (고용에 유효하지 않음)가 인쇄된 사회 보장 카드를 갖고있으며 , 귀하, 배우자 또는 자녀의 이민 신분이 현재 미국 시민권자 또는 영주권자로 변경됐을 경우, 이 기호가 없는 사회 보장 카드를 SSA에 요청하십시오._.
_**미국 시민권자.**_
SSN을 발급받을 당시 미국 시민권자였다면 유효한 SSN이 있는 것입니다.
_**INS의 승인 또는 DHS의 승인을 받은 취업에만 유효합니다.**_
사회 보장 카드에 “Valid for work only with INS authorization” (INS 승인을 받은 경우에만 취업에 유효) 또는 “Valid for work only with DHS authorization” (DHS 승인을 받은 경우에만 취업에 유효)하다고 쓰여 있는 경우, 유효한 SSN이 있지만, 그 승인이 유효한 경우에만 해당합니다. 
_**누락되거나 부정확한 SSN.**_
귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자의 SSN이 세금 신고서에서 누락되었거나 부정확한 경우, EIC를 받지 못할 수 있습니다. 
귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장 포함) 또는 그 이전에 유효한 SSN이 없었고, 나중에 유효한 SSN이 발급되지 않았기 때문에 신고서에 누락된 경우, 귀하는 EIC를 청구하기 위한 수정된 신고서를 제출할 수 없습니다. 그러나 귀하나 배우자가 EIC에 유효하지 않은 SSN을 발급받았었으나 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장 포함)전에 귀하나 배우자가 “Not valid for employment” (고용에 유효하지 않음) 이 인쇄되지 않은 사회 보장 카드에 적격하다면, 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장 포함) 전까지 사회 보장 카드가 업데이트되지 않았더라도 원본 또는 수정된 2024년 신고서에 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**기타 납세자 식별 번호.**
SSN이 아닌 본인 (또는 배우자, 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우)의 개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN)가 있으면 EIC를 받을 수 없습니다. ITIN은 IRS에서 SSN을 발급 받을 수 없는 비시민권자에게 발급됩니다. 
**SSN 없음.**
2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함) 또는 그 이전에 유효한 SSN이 없는 경우, 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 'No'를 입력하십시오. 기존 또는 수정된 2024년 신고서에서 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 
_**SSN 받기.**_
귀하 (또는 배우자, 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우)에게 SSN이 없는 경우, SSA에 양식 SS-5를 제출하여 신청할 수 있습니다. 양식 SS-5를 온라인 [SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf(영어)](http://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf), 해당 지역의 SSA 사무소에서, 또는 SSA에 800-772-1213로 전화하여 받을 수 있습니다.
_**신고 마감일 다가왔는데도 여전히 SSN이 없는 경우.**_
제출 마감일이 다가오고 있지만 SSN이 아직 없는 경우, 신고서 마감일에 대한 자동 6개월 연장 요청을 할 수 있습니다. 이 연장은 양식 4868, ‘미국 개인 소득세 신고서 제출 기간 자동 연장 신청서’를 제출하여 받을 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 양식 4868의 지침을 참고하십시오. 양식 4868을 제출하는 대신, 신고서 마감일까지 전자 결제로 자동 연장 신청을 할 수 있습니다.
#### 규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다
기혼자인 경우, 일반적으로 EIC 청구를 위해 반드시 공동 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 하지만 별거하는 부부에 대한 특별 규칙이 존재합니다.
**별거한 부부에 대한 특별 규칙.**
기혼이지만 공동 신고서 제출을 하지 않는 경우, 2024년에 적격 자녀와 반년 이상을 함께 살았고 아래의 보기 중 하나라도 적용이 된다면 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
  * 2024년의 마지막 6개월을 배우자와 별거했음, 혹은
  * 서면 별거 합의 또는 별거 유지령에 의해 주법상으로 법적 별거 중이며 2024년 말에 같은 집에 거주하고 있지 않았음.


이 요건들에 부합하다면 스케줄 EIC (양식 1040) 맨위에 있는 박스에 체크 표시를 하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 적격 자녀(들)을 명단에 올리려면 스케줄 EIC를 작성하고 귀하의 신고서에 첨부한다는 것을 명심하십시오._.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_EIC 청구 목적의 적격 자녀 조건을 갖춘 자녀가 있다면, 이 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없더라도 단독 EIC를 청구할 자격이 있을 수 있습니다._.
#### 규칙 4—연중 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인이어야 합니다
귀하가 연중 일정 기간 동안 비거주 외국인였던 경우, 납세자 구분이 부부 공동 신고가 아니라면 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 배우자가 미국 시민권자 또는 거주 외국인이고 미국 거주자로 간주하기로 선택한 경우에만 해당 납세자 구분을 사용할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 이 선택을 하는 경우, 귀하와 배우자의 전 세계 소득이 과세됩니다. 이 선택에 대한 추가 정보가 필요한 경우 간행물 519를 참고하십시오. 귀하가 연중 일정 기간 동안 비거주 외국인인 경우 그리고 납세자 구분이 부부 공동 신고가 아닐 경우 “No” 를 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 입력하십시오. 양식 1040 지침에 있는 _비거주 외국인 및 이중 신분 외국인_ 에서 전체 과세 연도 동안 비거주 또는 이중 신분 외국인 배우자를 미국 거주자로 취급하기로 하는 선택을 포함한 자세한 정보를 참조하십시오.
#### 규칙 5—양식 2555를 제출할 수 없습니다
양식 2555, ‘해외 근로 소득’을 제출하면 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이 양식을 제출하여 외국에서 벌어들인 소득을 총소득에서 제외하거나 외국 주택 비용을 공제하거나 제외할 수 있습니다. 미국 영토는 외국이 아닙니다. 추후에, 간행물 54에서 자세한 정보를 참고하십시오.
#### 규칙 6-투자 소득이 반드시 $11,600 이하여야 합니다
귀하의 투자 소득이 $11,600 이하여야만 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 투자 소득이 $11,600를 초과하는 경우 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.

#### 규칙 7— 반드시 근로 소득이 있어야 합니다
자격을 갖추려면 일을 하고 근로 소득이 있어야 하기 때문에 이 세액공제는 “근로 소득” 세액공제라고 불립니다. 기혼자며 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 배우자 중 한 명 이상이 일하고 소득이 있는 경우 이 규칙을 충족합니다. 귀하가 직원인 경우, 근로 소득에는 고용주로부터 받는 모든 과세 대상 소득이 포함됩니다.
_규칙 15_ 에 근로 소득 금액을 산정하는 데 도움이 되는 정보가 있습니다. 귀하가 자영업자이거나 법정 직원인 경우, EIC 작업표 B 양식 1040의 지침에서 귀하의 근로 소득을 확인할 수 있습니다.
#### 근로 소득
근로 소득에는 다음 모든 유형의 소득이 포함됩니다.
  1. 임금, 급여, 팁 및 기타 과세 대상 직원 급여. 직원 급여는 과세 대상인 경우에만 근로 소득입니다. 특정 부양 가족 보육 혜택 및 입양 혜택과 같은 비과세 직원 급여는 소득이 아닙니다. 하지만 비과세 전투 수당을 근로 소득에 포함하도록 선택할 수 있는 예외가 있으며, 이에 대해선 이 장의 후반부에서 설명할 것입니다.
  2. 자영업 순이익.
  3. 법정 직원으로써 받은 총소득.


**임금, 급여, 양식(들) W-2 박스 1에 신고된 팁.**
일을 해서 받은 임금, 급여, 팁은 양식 W-2의 박스 1에 신고됩니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 1a에 이를 신고해야 합니다. 
**다른 종류의 근로 소득**
양식 W–2 박스1에 신고되지 않은 다른 종류에 소득에는 가사 노동자 소득, 고용주에게 신고되지 않은 팁 소득, 비과세 지급금을 EIC 청구 목적상 근로 소득에 포함하기로 선택했을 경우 특정 메디케이드 포기 지급금, 과세대상 부양 가족 케어 혜택, 양식 8839에서의 고용주 제공 입양 혜택, 양식 8919에서의 급여 및 다른 근로 소득이 포함되어 있습니다. 이러한 소득들을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 1b에서 1h에 신고하십시오.
**비과세 전투 수당 선택.**
EIC에 대한 근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 비과세 전투 수당 금액은 양식 W-2의 박스 12에 코드 Q와 함께 표시되어야 합니다. 근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택하면 EIC가 증가하거나 감소할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 4장에서 [_비과세 전투 수당_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298606 "비과세 전투 수당.")을 참고하십시오.
**자영업 순이익.**
다음과 같은 경우 자영업 순이익이 있을 수 있습니다.
  * 귀하가 자신의 사업체를 소유하고 있거나, 
  * 귀하는 목사 또는 종교 교단 구성원일 경우. 


_**목사 주택.**_
목사 급여의 일부로 목사에게 제공되는 주택 또는 주택의 임대료는 일반적으로 소득세의 대상이 아니지만 자영업의 순이익에 포함됩니다. 이러한 이유로 EIC의 근로 소득에 포함됩니다 (단, 추후의 [_승인된 양식 4361 또는 양식 4029_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297682 "승인된 양식 4361 또는 양식 4029") 에 포함된 경우는 제외). 
**법정 직원.**
귀하가 법정 직원 박스 (박스 13)가 체크된 양식 W-2를 받았다면 귀하는 “법정 직원” 입니다. 귀하는 스케줄 C (양식 1040)에 법정 직원으로서 소득과 비용을 신고하십시오. 
**파업 및 폐쇄 혜택.**
현금 및 다른 자신의 (사실상 증여가 아닌) 공시가를 비롯한 파업 및 폐쇄 혜택으로서 귀하에게 지급된 혜택은 일반적으로 귀하에게 과세 대상입니다. 파업 및 폐쇄 혜택이 과세 대상이라면, 이 혜택은 일반적으로 근로 소득입니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040–SR 라인 1h에 이 파업 및 폐쇄 혜택의 금액을 신고해야 합니다. 
#### 승인된 양식 4361 또는 양식 4029
이 섹션은:
  * 양식 4361, ‘목사, 종교 교단 구성원, 크리스찬 사이언스 종사자의 자영업세 면제 신청서’, 또는
  * 양식 4029, ‘사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금 면제 신청 및 혜택 포기 신청서’가 있는 사람을 위한 것입니다.


각 승인된 양식은 사회 보장 세금에서 특정 소득을 면제합니다. 각 양식은 EIC의 근로 소득 여부와 관련하여 논의됩니다.
**양식 4361.**
승인된 양식 4361이 있는지 여부와 관계없이, 직원으로서 종무를 수행하여 받은 금액은 소득으로 계산됩니다. 여기에는 임금, 급여, 팁 및 기타 과세 대상 직원 보수가 포함됩니다. 
승인된 양식 4361이 있는 경우, 비과세 주택 지원금 또는 주택의 비과세 임대료는 근로 소득이 아닙니다. 또한, 직원이 아닐 때 종무를 수행하여 받은 금액은 근로 소득으로 계산되지 않습니다. 예를 들면, 결혼식 주례비용과 연설 사례비 등이 있습니다. 
**양식 4029.**
승인된 양식 4029가 있는지 여부와 관계없이, 모든 임금, 급여, 팁 및 기타 과세 대상 직원 보수는 근로 소득으로 계산됩니다. 하지만, 개인 자영업자로서 받은 금액은 근로 소득으로 계산되지 않습니다. 또한 근로 소득을 계산할 때 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 1a에서 1h에 신고되는 임금에서 스케줄 C 또는 F의 손실을 제하지 마십시오. 
#### 장애 혜택
장애로 인해 은퇴한 경우, 고용주의 장애 은퇴 플랜에 따라 받는 과세 대상 혜택은 최소 은퇴 연령에 도달할 때까지 근로 소득으로 간주됩니다. 최소 은퇴 연령은 일반적으로 귀하가 장애가 없는 경우 연금을 받을 수 있었던 가장 빠른 연령입니다. 최소 은퇴 연령에 도달할 때까지 과세 대상 장애 급여를 양식 1040 및 1040-SR의 라인 1h에 신고해야 합니다.
최소 은퇴 연령에 도달한 다음 날부터 받는 급여는 연금으로 과세되며 근로 소득으로 간주되지 않습니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 5a 및 5b의 과세 대상 연금 지급금을 신고합니다.
**장애 보험금.**
귀하가 보험료를 납입한 장애 보험에서 받은 지급금은 근로 소득이 아닙니다. 최소 은퇴 연령에 도달했는지 여부는 중요하지 않습니다. 이 보험이 고용주를 통해 적용되는 경우, 해당 금액은 W-2 양식의 12번 박스에 코드 J로 표시될 수 있습니다. 
#### 근로 소득이 아닌 소득
근로 소득이 아닌 항목의 예로는 이자 및 배당금, 연금, 사회 보장 및 철도 퇴직 혜택 (장애 혜택 포함), 위자료 및 자녀 양육비, 복지 혜택, 근로자 상해보험 혜택, 실업 수당 (보험), 비과세 위탁 혜택 및 VA 재활 혜택을 포함한 보훈 급여가 있습니다. 근로 소득에 이런 줄을 포함하지 않습니다. 
**재소 기간중 소득.**
수감자가 교도소에서 수행한 서비스에 대해 받은 금액은 EIC를 계산할 때의 근로 소득이 아닙니다. 
**근로장려금.**
비과세 근로장려금은 EIC의 근로 소득이 아닙니다. TANF 프로그램에 따라 자금을 지원하는 공적 구제 프로그램을 운영하는 주 또는 지방 기관에서 특정인이 (1) 민간 부문 고용이 충분하지 않은 경우 직장 체험 활동 (공공 주택 리모델링 또는 수리 포함) 또는 (2) 지역사회 서비스 프로그램 활동과 같은 특정 업무 활동에 대한 대가로 받는 현금 지급금입니다. 
**부부 공동 재산.**
기혼이지만 별거 중인 기혼 납세자에 대한 특별 규칙에 따라 세대주 또는 부부 개별 신고로서 신고할 자격이 있으며 (참조 [규칙 3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297448 "규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다")), 부부 공동 재산법이 있는 주에서 거주하는 경우, 귀하의 EIC 근로 소득에는 해당 법에 따라 귀하의 소유로 취급되는 배우자의 모든 수입이 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 금액은 소득 신고에 총소득으로 포함해야 하더라도 EIC에 대한 근로 소득이 아닙니다. 주의 부부 공동 재산법에 의해 일부가 배우자의 소유로 취급되더라도, 귀하의 근로 소득에는 귀하가 번 금액 전체가 포함됩니다. 
_**네바다, 워싱턴, 그리고 캘리포니아 동거자.**_
네바다주, 워싱턴주 또는 캘리포니아주의 등록된 동거자의 경우, 동일한 규정이 적용됩니다. EIC의 근로 소득에는 동거자의 수입이 전혀 포함되지 않습니다. 귀하의 근로 소득에는 귀하가 번 금액 전체가 포함됩니다. 자세한 내용은 간행물 555를 참고하십시오. 
**CRP (보존유보플랜) 지급금.**
CRP 지급금을 받았을 때 사회 보장 퇴직 급여 또는 사회 보장 장애 급여를 받고 있었다면 CRP 지급금은 EIC의 근로 소득이 아닙니다. 
**비과세 군 급여.**
군인의 비과세 급여는 EIC의 근로 소득으로 간주되지 않습니다. 비과세 군인 급여의 예로는 전투 수당, 주택기본수당 (BAH), 부식기본수당 (BAS)이 있습니다. 추후에, 간행물 3에서 자세한 내용을 참고하십시오. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)** 전투 수당. **_EIC 근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 4장에서_[비과세 전투 수당](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298606 "비과세 전투 수당.") _을 참고하십시오._.
## 2. 적격 자녀가 있는 경우의 규칙
1장의 모든 규칙을 충족했다면, 이 장을 사용하여 적격 자녀가 있는지 확인하십시오. 이 장에서는 _규칙 8~10_ 에 대해 다룹니다. 적격 자녀를 가지고 EIC를 받으려면 1장 및 4장의 규칙 외에도 세 가지 규칙을 모두 충족해야 합니다.
EIC 청구 목적의 조건을 갖춘 한명의 적격 자녀가 있다면, 귀하에게 EIC 자격을 부여하는 이 자녀가 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장 포함)까지 유효한 SSN이 없더라도 이 규칙을 따르십시오.
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출할 때, EIC 청구 목적의 조건을 갖춘 한명이상의 적격 자녀가 있다면, 이 자녀가 신고서 마감일 (연장 포함)까지 유효한 SSN이 없더라도 스케줄 EIC를 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 적격 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없을 경우 스케줄 EIC를 작성하는 방법에 대한 정보는 스케줄 EIC를 참고하십시오. 1장과 이 장의 모든 규칙을 충족하는 경우, 4장을 읽고 다음에 무엇을 해야 하는지 알아보십시오.
**적격 자녀 없음.**
만약 _규칙 8_ 을 충족하지 못하면, 귀하에게는 적격 자녀가 없습니다. 3장을 읽고 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 받을 수 있는지 알아보십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_자녀가 귀하의 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트를 충족하지만 다른 사람의 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트도 충족하는 경우, 오직 한 사람만 이 자녀를 실제 적격 자녀로 취급하여 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다. 다른 사람이 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 적격 자녀 청구를 하는 경우 다른 적격 자녀가 없는 한 납세자로서 적격 자녀 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 그러나 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다._.
#### 규칙 8— 귀하의 자녀는 반드시 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족해야 합니다
자녀가 네 가지 테스트를 충족하는 경우 귀하의 자녀는 적격 자녀입니다. 네 가지 테스트는 다음과 같습니다.
  1. 관계,
  2. 나이,
  3. 거주지, 그리고
  4. 공동 신고서.


다음 단락은 각 테스트에 대한 자세한 정보를 포함하고 있습니다.
#### 관계 테스트
적격 자녀가 되려면 자녀가
  * 아들, 딸, 의붓 자녀, 위탁 자녀 또는 그중 한 명의 자녀 (예: 귀하의 손주) 또는 
  * 형제, 자매, 남동생, 여동생, 의붓 형제, 의붓 자매 또는 이들 중 어느 한 사람의 자녀 (예: 귀하의 조카)를 말합니다.


다음 정의는 관계 테스트를 명확히 합니다.
**입양 자녀.**
입양된 자녀는 항상 귀하의 자녀로 취급됩니다. 용어 “입양 자녀” 는 법적 입양을 위해 적법하게 귀하에게 맡겨진 자녀를 포함합니다. 
**위탁 자녀.**
EIC의 경우, 자녀가 공인 알선 기관 또는 판결, 법령 또는 관할 법원의 기타 명령에 의해 귀하에게 맡겨진 경우 위탁 자녀입니다. 공인 알선 기관에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
  * 주 또는 지방 정부 기관,
  * 국가의 허가를 받은 면세 단체 및
  * 인디언 부족 정부 또는 인디언 부족 정부가 인디언 아이들을 맡기도록 승인한 조직.


**예.**
12세인 딘은 위탁 가정에 아이들을 맡기는 권한을 가진 기관에 의해 2년 전에 귀하의 위탁 가정에 맡겨졌습니다. 딘은 귀하의 위탁 자녀입니다. 
#### 연령 테스트
귀하의 자녀는 반드시
  1. 2024년 말 만 19세 미만이며 귀하 (또는 배우자, 공동 신고할 경우)보다 어려야 하며,
  2. 2024년 말 만 24세 미만이며 학생이고, 귀하 (또는 배우자, 공동 신고할 경우)보다 어려야 하고;
  3. 2024년 중 항상, 나이에 관계없이, 영구적이고 완전한 장애가 있어여함.


다음 예시와 정의는 연령 테스트를 명확히 설명합니다.
**예시 1-자녀가 만 19세 미만이 아닌 경우.**
귀하의 자녀 샘은 12월 10일에 만 19살이 되었습니다. 샘이 영구적이고 완전히 장애가 있거나 학생이 아니라면, 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 왜냐하면 연말에 만 19세 **미만** 이 아니기 때문입니다.
**예시 2-자녀가 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자보다 어리지 않은 경우.**
풀타임 학생이자 미혼인 만 23세의 형제자매 블레이크는 귀하와 귀하의 배우자와 함께 살고 있습니다. 블레이크는 장애인이 아닙니다. 귀하와 배우자 모두 만 21세이며, 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 블레이크가 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자보다 어리지 않기 때문에 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**예시 3-자녀가 배우자보다 어리지만 귀하보다 어리지 않은 경우.**
이 예시는 _예 2와 같지만_ 배우자가 만 25세라는 점은 다릅니다. 블레이크가 배우자보다 어리므로 귀하보다 어리지 않더라도 적격 자녀입니다.
**학생에 대한 정의.**
학생으로서의 자격을 갖추려면 자녀는 보통 연도 중 각 5개월의 일부 기간 동안 반드시
  1. 정규 교직원, 연구 과정 및 정규 학생 기관이 있는 학교의 풀타임 학생; 또는
  2. (1)에서 설명된 학교 또는 주, 카운티 또는 지방 정부에서 제공하는 풀타임 농업훈련 과정을 수강하는 학생이어야 합니다.


연속적인 5개월 일 필요는 없습니다.
풀타임 학생은 학교가 풀타임 출석으로 고려되는 시간 또는 과정에 등록된 학생입니다.
_**학교에 대한 정의.**_
학교는 초등학교, 중학교 또는 고등학교, 칼리지, 대학이나 기술, 무역 또는 기계 학교일 수 있습니다. 그러나 실무 훈련 과정이나 통신 교육 학교, 또는 인터넷 강의만 제공하는 학교는 EIC의 학교로 간주되지 않습니다.
_**직업 고등학교 학생.**_
학교의 강의 및 실습 교육 과정의 일환으로 민간 업계의 협동조합에서 일하는 학생은 풀타임 학생으로 간주됩니다.
**영구적이고 완전한 장애.**
다음 두 가지가 모두 적용되는 경우 자녀에게 영구적으로 완전한 장애가 있습니다. 
  1. 귀하의 자녀는 신체적 또는 정신적 조건으로 인해 실질적인 이익이 되는 활동을 할 수 없습니다.
  2. 의사는 병태가 지속되었거나 적어도 1년 동안 지속될 것으로 예상되거나 사망으로 이어질 수 있다고 단정했습니다.


_**실질적으로 이익이 되는 활동.**_
실질적으로 이익이 되는 활동은 급여나 이익을 위해 일하는 동안 합리적인 기간에 걸쳐 유의미한 의무를 수행하는 것, 또는 일반적으로 급여나 이윤을 얻기 위해 하는 일을 말합니다. 최소한 최저 임금에 대한 경쟁적 근로 상황에서 풀타임 (또는 고용주의 편의에 따라 수행되는 파트타임)은 자녀가 실질적인 이익이 되는 활동에 종사할 수 있음을 보여줍니다.
실질적으로 이익이 되는 활동은 자신이나 집을 돌보는 일이 아닙니다. 취미, 기관 치료 또는 교육, 학교 출석, 클럽, 사교 프로그램 및 유사한 활동에 대한 무급 근무가 아닙니다. 그러나, 이런 종류의 일을 하는 것은 자녀가 실질적인으로 이익이 되는 활동에 참여할 수 있음을 보여줄 수 있습니다.
자녀가 한동안 일을 하지 않았다고 해서 그 자체로 자녀가 실질적인 이익이 되는 활동을 할 수 없다는 것을 증명하는 것은 아닙니다.
실질적으로 이익이 되는 활동의 예에 대해서는, 스케줄 R (양식 1040)에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
#### 거주지 테스트
귀하의 자녀는 2024년의 절반 이상 미국에서 귀하와 함께 살았어야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하가 자녀의 생활비 대부분을 지불했더라도 일년 중 절반 이상 함께 살지 않은 자녀에 대해 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. IRS는 각 적격 자녀와 함께 살았음을 증명하는 서류를 요청할 수 있습니다. 이러한 목적을 위해 보관할 수 있는 문서에는 학교와 탁아 기록 및 자녀의 주소가 표시된 기타 기록이 포함됩니다._.
아래의 단락은 거주지 테스트를 명확히 설명합니다.
**미국.**
미국은 50개 주와 컬럼비아 특별구를 의미합니다. 푸에르토리코 또는 괌과 같은 미국 영토는 포함되지 않습니다.
**노숙자 보호소.**
귀하가 규칙적으로 주거하는 모든 장소가 집이 될 수 있습니다. 전통적인 집일 필요는 없습니다. 예를 들어 자녀와 한 곳 이상의 노숙자 보호소에서 반년 이상 함께 거주했다면 자녀는 거주지 테스트를 충족합니다. 
**미국 외 지역에서 복무하는 군인.**
장기 현역 복무로 인해 미국 외 지역에서 복무하는 미군에 대해 EIC 목적상 해당 복무 기간 동안 미국에 거주하는 것으로 간주합니다. 
_**장기 현역 복무**_
현역 복무 연장은 무기한 또는 90일 이상의 기간 동안 복무하도록 요청받거나 명령을 받는 것을 의미합니다. 현역 복무를 시작하면 90일 이상 복무하지 않더라도 장기 현역 복무인 것으로 간주됩니다.
**자녀의 출생 또는 사망.**
2024년에 츨생했거나 사망한 자녀에 대해 2024년의 절반 이상 귀하와 함께 산 것으로 간주됩니다. 귀하의 집이 자녀의 집인 경우 2024년에 자녀가 살아있던 시간의 절반 이상 동안 귀하와 함께 산 것으로 간주됩니다. 
**입양 자녀.**
2024년에 자녀를 입양했으며, 2024년에 법적 입양을 위해 적법하게 귀하에게 맡겨졌거나 또는 이 자녀가 2024년에 귀하에게 맡겨진 적격 위탁 아동이였으며 2024년에 이 자녀 입양 또는 맡겨진 기간 중 반 이상이 귀하의 집이 자녀의 집이 였었던 경우, 이 자녀가 2024년에 귀하와 반년 이상 거주했던 것으로 간주됩니다.
**유괴된 자녀.**
만약 자녀가 유괴된 전날 또는 돌아온 연도의 절반 이상을 귀하와 함께 살았다면, 이 연도의 절반 이상을 귀하와 함께 산 것으로 간주됩니다. 법 집행 기관은 자녀가 귀하의 가족이나 자녀의 가족이 아닌 사람에 의해 유괴된 것으로 간주해야 합니다. 이러한 취급은 자녀가 돌아올 때까지 모든 해에 적용됩니다. 그러나 이 취급이 적용될 수 있는 마지막 연도는 다음 상황이 발생하기 전 연도입니다.
  1. 자녀가 사망했다는 판정을 받은 해, 또는
  2. 자녀가 만 18세가 되는 해.


적격 자녀가 유괴되어 이러한 요구 사항을 충족하는 경우 “KC” 를 스케줄 EIC의 라인 6에 있는 숫자 대신 입력합니다. 
#### 공동 신고서 테스트
이 테스트를 충족하기 위해 해당 자녀는 해당 연도의 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 없습니다.
**예외.**
자녀 및 자녀의 배우자가 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정세의 환급만을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우 공동 신고 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용됩니다.
**예 1—자녀가 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
귀하는 만 18세인 자녀를 부양했고, 자녀의 배우자가 군대에 있는 동안 귀하의 자녀는 일년 내내 귀하와 함께 살았습니다. 자녀의 배우자는 한 해 동안 $25,000를 벌었습니다. 자녀의 부부가 공동 신고서를 제출하기 때문에 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**예 2-자녀가 원천징수된 세금을 환급받기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
만 18세인 자녀와 만 17세인 자녀의 배우자는 파트타임로 $800의 임금을 받고 있고 다른 소득은 없습니다. 이들에게는 자녀가 없습니다. 둘 다 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 됩니다. 세금은 급여에서 공제되었으므로 원천징수된 세금만 환급받기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 공동 신고서 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용되므로 다른 모든 조건이 충족되면 귀하의 자녀는 적격 자녀가 될 수 있습니다.
**예 3-자녀가 미국인 기회 세액공제를 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예 2와 같지만_ 자녀의 급여에서 세금이 공제되지 않았다는 점이 다릅니다. 자녀와 자녀의 배우자는 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없지만 공동 신고서를 제출하여 $124의 미국인 기회 세액공제를 청구하고 해당 금액을 환급 받습니다. 미국인 기회 세액공제를 청구하는 것이 신고서를 제출하는 이유이며, 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 청구하기 위해서만 제출하는 것이 아닙니다. 공동 신고서에 대한 예외가 적용되지 않으므로 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**기혼 자녀.**
자녀가 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않더라도, 자녀가 연말전에 결혼한 경우, 다음의 경우를 제외하고는 적격 자녀가 될 수 없습니다.
  1. 귀하가 이 자녀를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우, 또는
  2. 자녀를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 없는 사유가 나중에 설명할 [_이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)를 위한 특별 규칙_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298533 "이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 \(또는 따로 사는 부모\)를 위한 특별 규칙.")에 따라 자녀의 다른 부모가 자녀를 부양가족으로 청구하도록 허용했기 때문인 경우.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)사회 보장 번호 (SSN)._적격 자녀를 근거로 더 높은 EIC 세액공제를 청구하려면 이 적격 자녀는 2024년 신고서 마감일 (연장일 포함) 또는 그 이전에 유효한 SSN이 있어야 하며, 2024년에 출생 또는 사망한 경우에는 신고서에 자녀의 출생증명서, 사망 증명서 또는 출생 사실을 보여주는 병원 기록 사본을 첨부해야 합니다. 다음과 같은 경우 적격 자녀를 근거로 더 높은 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다._.
  1. 적격 자녀의 SSN이 세금 신고서에서 누락되었거나 부정확한 경우;
  2. 적격 자녀의 사회 보장 카드에 “Not valid for employment” (고용에 유효하지 않음) 이라고 쓰여 있고 연방 기금 혜택 수급에 사용하기 위해 발급된 경우, 또는
  3. SSN 대신 적격 자녀가
    1. SSN을 발급받을 수 없는 비시민권자에게 발급되는 ITIN을 소지하고 있을 경우, 또는 
    2. 입양 납세자 식별 번호 (ATIN)는 입양이 완료될 때까지 입양될 자녀에 대한 SSN을 발급받을 수 없는 입양 부모에게 발급됩니다.


_적격 자녀가 두 명 이상이고 유효한 SSN이 하나만 있는 경우, 해당 자녀 한 명에 대해서만 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다. SSN에 대한 자세한 내용은_[규칙 2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297446 "규칙 2–유효한 사회 보장 번호 \(SSN\)가 있어야 합니다") _를 참고하십시오._.

때때로 한명의 자녀가 두 명 이상의 사람의 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트에 충족합니다. 그러나 이러한 사람 중 오직 한 명만이 실제로 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 한 명만 자녀를 적격 자녀로 사용하여 다음 세금 혜택을 모두 받을 수 있습니다 (당사자가 각 혜택을 받을 수 있는 경우).
  1. 자녀 세액공제, 기타 부양가족에 대한 세액공제, 또는 추가 자녀 세액공제.
  2. 세대주 납세자 구분 
  3. 자녀 및 부양가족 케어 비용에 대한 세액공제.
  4. 부양가족 케어 혜택의 제외.
  5. EIC.


상대방은 이 적격 자녀를 근거로 이러한 혜택을 받을 수 없습니다. 즉, 귀하와 상대방은 이러한 세금 혜택을 나누는 합의를 할 수 없습니다. 상대방은 다른 적격 자녀가 없는 한 이러한 세금 혜택을 받을 수 없습니다. 
다음 타이브레이커 규칙은 두 명 이상의 사람이 동일한 적격 자녀를 둔 경우 누가 EIC를 청구할 수 있는지에 대해 설명합니다. 그러나 상대방이 귀하의 배우자이며 귀하가 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우 타이브레이커 규칙은 적용되지 않습니다.
**타이브레이커 규칙.**
한 자녀를 방금 나열된 다섯가지 세금 혜택을 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 간주할 수 있는 사람을 결정하기 위해 다음 타이브레이커 규칙이 적용됩니다. 타이브레이커 규칙의 목적상 “부모”라는 용어는 어느 한 개인의 친부모 또는 양부모라는 뜻입니다. 여기에는 이 개인을 입양하지 않은 한, 의붓부모 또는 위탁 부모는 포함되지 않습니다.
  * 두 사람 중 한 명만 자녀의 부모인 경우 자녀는 부모의 적격 자녀로 간주됩니다.
  * 부모가 함께 공동 신고서를 제출하고 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있는 경우 자녀는 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다.
  * 부모가 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않았지만 부모 둘 다 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구하는 경우, IRS는 자녀를 1년 중 더 오랜 기간 동안 거주한 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급합니다. 자녀가 각 부모와 함께 산 기간이 같을 경우, IRS는 자녀를 해당 연도의 AGI가 가장 높은 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급합니다.
  * 부모가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없는 경우, 자녀는 해당 연도에 가장 높은 AGI를 보유한 사람의 적격 자녀로 간주됩니다.
  * 부모가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있지만 이 자녀를 청구하지 않는 경우 이 자녀는 해당 연도에 가장 높은 AGI를 보유한 사람의 적격 자녀로 취급되지만 자녀를 청구를 할 수 있는 자녀 부모의 최고 AGI보다 그 사람의 AGI가 높은 경우에만 적격 자녀로 간주됩니다.


.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_적격 자녀가 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 2024년에 다른 사람의 적격 자녀로 간주되는 경우, 3장의 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자에 대한 규칙을 사용하여 EIC를 신청할 수 있습니다._.
이 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 귀하와 상대방은 둘 중 누가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있는지 선택할 수 있습니다. [예시 1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298467 "예시 1—자녀가 부모 및 조부모와 함께 사는 경우.")에서 [12](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298529 "예시 12—아이가 부모와 함께 살지 않는 경우.")까지를 참고하십시오.
적격 자녀가 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 2024년에 다른 사람의 적격 자녀로 취급되어서 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우, 다른 적격 자녀를 사용해 EIC를 받을 수 있습니다. 또는 3장의 적격 자녀가 없는 사람에 대한 규칙을 사용하여 EIC를 신청할 수 있습니다.
**상대방이 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우.**
귀하와 상대방이 동일한 적격 자녀를 두고 있지만 이 상대방이 자격이 없거나 소득 또는 AGI가 너무 높은 이유로 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우, 귀하가 이 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 이전의 [예시 6](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298472 "예시 6—조부모의 근로 소득이 너무 높아 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우.")와 [7](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298473 "예시 7—부모의 근로 소득이 너무 높아 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우.")을 참고하십시오. 그러나 상대방 이 자녀를 통해 이 장에서 앞서 나열된 다른 다섯 가지 세금 혜택을 청구하는 경우 귀하는 이 자녀를 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 간주할 수 없습니다.
**예시.**
다음 예는 귀하와 다른 사람이 동일한 적격 자녀를 둔 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있는지를 결정하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
**예시 1—자녀가 부모 및 조부모와 함께 사는 경우.**
귀하와 만 2세 자녀 샘은 일년 내내 귀하의 부모와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 25세, 미혼이며 AGI는 $9,000입니다. 귀하의 유일한 소득은 파트타임으로 번 $9,000이였습니다. 귀하의 부모님의 유일한 소득은 직장에서 받은 $22,000이였고 AGI는 $22,000입니다. 샘의 다른 부모는 귀하나 샘과 함께 살지 않았습니다. 나중에 설명할 이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)를 위한 특별 규칙이 적용되지 않습니다. 샘은 귀하와 귀하의 부모와의 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 각각 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 귀하 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 그러나, 둘 중 한 명만 EIC (그리고 적격한 사람인 경우 이 장에서 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택도)를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 샘은 샘의 다른 부모를 포함하여 다른 누구의 적격 자녀도 아닙니다. 귀하가 샘을 EIC 또는 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀로 청구하지 않는 경우, 귀하의 부모는 샘을 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다.
**예시 2—부모가 조부모보다 AGI가 더 높은 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ AGI가 $25,000이라는 점이 다릅니다. 귀하 부모의 AGI가 귀하보다 높지 않기 때문에, 귀하의 부모는 샘을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없습니다. 오직 귀하만 샘을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 3—두 명이 같은 자녀를 청구하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ 귀하와 귀하의 부모 모두 샘을 적격 자녀로 청구하는 점이 다릅니다. 이 경우, 귀하가 자녀의 부모로서 EIC 및 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀로 샘을 청구할 수 있는 유일한 부모가 됩니다. IRS는 귀하의 부모가 EIC에 청구하는 것과 샘을 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 받는 것을 불허할 것입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI가 $18,591을 초과하기 때문에 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자를 위한 EIC를 받을 수 없습니다.
**예시 4—적격 자녀를 두 사람이 나누는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ 단, 귀하에게는, 귀하와 귀하의 부모 모두에게 적격 자녀인 다른 두 명의 어린 자녀가 있습니다. 둘 중 한 명만 각 자녀를 청구할 수 있습니다. 그러나 귀하의 부모의 AGI가 귀하보다 높으면 귀하의 부모가 두 명 이상의 자녀를 청구하도록 허용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 귀하가 한 명의 자녀를 청구하는 경우, 귀하의 어머니는 다른 두 명의 자녀를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 5-납세자가 적격 자녀인 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ 귀하가 만 18세라는 점이 다릅니다. 이는 귀하가 귀하의 부모의 적격 자녀라는 것을 의미합니다. 다음에 논의할 _규칙 10_ 으로 인해, 귀하는 EIC를 청구할 수 없으며 샘을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없습니다. 귀하의 부모만이 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 샘을 취급할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 부모가 EIC를 청구하기 위한 다른 모든 요건을 충족하고 귀하가 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀로 샘을 청구하지 않는 경우, 귀하의 부모는 귀하와 샘을 EIC에 대한 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 6—조부모의 근로 소득이 너무 높아 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ 귀하의 부모가 근로 소득으로 $50,000를 벌었다는 점이 다릅니다. 귀하의 부모의 소득이 EIC를 청구하기에 너무 높기 때문에 오직 귀하만이 샘을 사용하여 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 7—부모의 근로 소득이 너무 높아 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 1과 같지만_ 귀하의 근로 소득이 $50,000이고 AGI가 $50,500라는 점이 다릅니다. EIC를 청구하기에는 귀하의 소득이 너무 높습니다. 그러나 귀하의 부모도 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI가 귀하보다 높지 않기 때문입니다.
**예시 8—부모가 별거 중인 경우.**
귀하와 귀하의 배우자, 그리고 귀하의 만 10세 자녀, 조단은 2024년 8월 1일까지 함께 살았습니다. 그 후, 배우자는 이사 나갔습니다. 8월과 9월에 조단은 귀하와 함께 살았습니다. 남은 한 해 동안, 조단은 조단의 다른 부모인 귀하의 배우자와 함께 살았습니다. 조단은 귀하와 배우자 둘다의 적격 자녀입니다. 왜냐하면 조단은 반년 이상 두 사람과 함께 살았으며, 두 사람의 관계, 연령 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족했기 때문입니다. 연말에, 귀하와 배우자는 여전히 이혼하지 않았고, 법적으로 분리되으며, 또란 서면 분리 합의에 따라 분리되지 않았습니다. 이러한 이유로 _[이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)를 위한 특별 규칙](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298533 "이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 \(또는 따로 사는 부모\)를 위한 특별 규칙.")_ 이 적용 되지 않습니다. 
귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 개별 신고서를 제출합니다. 배우자는 귀하가 조단을 적격 자녀로 취급하는 것에 동의합니다. 즉, 귀하의 배우자가 앞서 나열된 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀로 조단을 청구하지 않는 경우, 귀하에게 적격한 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀로 조단을 청구할 수 있습니다. 그러나, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 마지막 6개월동안 별거하지 않았고 2024년 말에 별거 중 이였더라도 서면 별거 합의 또는 별거 유지령에 의해 주법상으로 법적 별거 중이 아니였기 때문에 EIC 를 받을 수 없습니다. 따라서 귀하는 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 특정 별거 중인 배우자가 EIC를 받을 수 있는 요건에 충족하지 않습니다. 이전의 [규칙 3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297448 "규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다")을 참고하십시오. 또한 귀하의 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 신고이며 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 떨어져 살지 않았기 때문에 귀하는 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용에 대한 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 간행물 503을 참고하십시오.
**예시 9— 별거 중인 부모가 같은 자녀를 청구하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 8과 같지만_ 귀하와 배우자 모두 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구하는 점이 다릅니다. 이 경우 오직 배우자만이 조단을 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 왜냐하면, 2024년에 자녀는 귀하보다 배우자과 더 오래 함께 살았기 때문입니다. 귀하는 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 별거 중인 배우자이며 적격 자녀가 없는 이유로 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 그러나, 배우자의 납세자 구분 또한 부부 개별 신고가고, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 마지막 6개월동안 별거하지 않았으며, 2024년 말에 별거 중 이였더라도 서면 별거 합의 또는 별거 유지령에 의해 주법상으로 법적 별거 중이 아니였기 때문에 귀하의 배우자 역시 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 따라서 귀하의 배우자는 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 특정 별거 중인 배우자가 EIC를 받을 수 있는 요건에 충족하지 않습니다. 이전의 [규칙 3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297448 "규칙 3-배우자와 별거했고 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면, 특정 규칙에 반드시 부합해야합니다")을 참고하십시오. 또한 배우자의 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 신고이며 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 떨어져 살지 않았기 때문에 귀하의 배우자 역시 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용에 대한 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 간행물 503을 참고하십시오.
**예시 10—미혼 부모의 경우.**
귀하와 만 5세 자녀, 로건 그리고 로건의 다른 부모는 일년 내내 함께 살았습니다. 귀하와 로건의 다른 부모는 결혼하지 않았습니다. 로건은 귀하와 로건의 다른 부모와의 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 각각 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 로건의 다른 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하의 소득과 AGI는 $12,000이며, 로건의 다른 부모의 소득과 AGI는 $14,000 입니다. 두 사람 모두 다른 소득이 없었습니다. 로건의 다른 부모는 귀하가 이 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급하는 데 동의합니다. 즉, 로건의 다른 부모가 로건을 EIC 또는 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 받을 수 있는 적격 자녀 청구에 로건을 사용하지 않는 경우, 귀하가 로건을 EIC 및 앞서 나열된 다른 세금 혜택을 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다.
**예시 11— 미혼 부모가 같은 자녀에 대해 청구하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예시 10과 같지만_ 귀하와 L의 다른 부모 둘다 로건을 적격 자녀로 청구하는 점이 다릅니다. 이 경우 로건의 다른 부모만 로건을 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 왜냐하면 로건의 다른 부모의 AGI인 $14,000가 귀하의 AGI $12,000보다 많기 때문입니다. 귀하는 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 12—아이가 부모와 함께 살지 않는 경우.**
귀하와 형제자매의 자녀인 만 7세 모건은 일년 내내 귀하의 부모와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 25세이며 AGI는 $9,300입니다. 귀하의 유일한 소득원은 파트타임 직장입니다. 귀하 부모의 AGI는 $15,000입니다. 귀하 부모의 유일한 소득원은 직장입니다. 모건의 부모는 공동으로 세금을 신고하고, AGI가 $9,000 미만이며, 귀하 또는 M과 함께 살지 않습니다. 모건은 귀하와 어머니의 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 각각 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 귀하 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 그러나 귀하의 부모만이 모건을 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI인 $15,000가 귀하의 AGI $9,300보다 높기 때문입니다.
**이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)를 위한 특별 규칙.**
아래의 진술들이 모두 사실인 경우 자녀는 비양육권을 가진 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다.
  1. 부모가
    1. 이혼 했거나 별거 유지령에 의해 법적으로 분리된 경우;
    2. 서면 별거 합의에 따라 분리된 경우; 또는
    3. 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 계속 떨어져 살았을 경우.
  2. 자녀는 부모로부터 한 해 동안 절반 이상을 지원받았을 경우.
  3. 해당 아동은 2024년의 절반 이상을 한 명 또는 두 명의 부모에게 양육된 경우.

    1. 양육 부모는 양식 8332에 서명하거나 또는 자녀를 해당 연도에 부양가족으로 청구하지 않는다는 실질적으로 유사한 진술에 서명하고, 비양육 부모는 양식 또는 진술을 자신의 신고서에 첨부합니다. 1984년 이후와 2009년 이전에 이혼 법령 또는 별거 합의가 발효된 경우, 비양육 부모는 양식 8332 대신 법령 또는 계약서의 특정 페이지를 첨부할 수 있습니다. 
    2. 2024년에 적용되는 1985년 이전 이혼 법령 또는 별거 유지 또는 서면 별거 합의로 비양육 부모가 자녀를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있으며, 비양육 부모는 2024년에 자녀를 지원하기 위해 최소 $600를 제공합니다.


자세한 내용은 간행물 501을 참고하십시오. 이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)의 자녀에 대한 이 특별 규칙에 따라 자녀가 비양육 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급되는 경우 비양육 부모만 자녀에 대한 자녀 세액공제 또는 다른 부양에 대한 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 그러나 적격한 경우 양육 부모 또는 다른 적격 납세자만 자녀를 EIC의 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용 및 예는 간행물 501에서 _이혼 또는 별거 중인 부모 (또는 따로 사는 부모)에 타이브레이커 규칙 적용_ 을 참고하십시오.
#### 규칙 10-귀하는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 될 수 없습니다
아래의 진술들이 모두 사실인 경우 귀하는 다른 납세자 (예: 귀하의 부모, 보호자 또는 양부모)의 적격 자녀입니다.
  1. 귀하는 해당 납세자의 아들, 딸, 의붓 자녀, 위탁 자녀 또는 이중 하나에 해당됩니다. 또는 그 사람의 형제, 자매, 이복/이부/의붓 형제, 이복/이부/의붓 자매 또는 이중 하나에 해당됩니다. 
  2. 귀하가:
    1. 연말에 만 19세 미만이며 그 사람 (또는 그 사람의 배우자, 공동 신고의 경우)보다 어린 경우,
    2. 연말에 만 24세 미만이며 학생이고, 그 사람 (또는 그 사람의 배우자, 공동 신고의 경우)보다 어린 경우, 또는
    3. 연령에 상관없이 영구적이며 완전히 장애가 있는 경우.
  3. 귀하는 그 사람과 함께 1년 중 절반 이상을 미국에 거주했어야 합니다.
  4. 귀하는 해당 연도 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 사람 (또는 오직 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 청구하기 위해서만 공동 신고서를 제출하는 사람)입니다.


적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트에 대한 자세한 내용은 [규칙 8](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297706 "규칙 8— 귀하의 자녀는 반드시 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족해야 합니다")을 참고하십시오. 
귀하가 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀인 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이는 귀하를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있는 사람이 EIC를 청구하지 않거나 EIC를 청구하기 위한 모든 규칙을 충족하지 않는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. “No”를 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 입력하십시오.
**예시.**
귀하와 귀하의 자녀는 일년 내내 귀하의 부모와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 22세이고, 미혼이며, 직업학교에 풀타임으로 다니고 있습니다. 귀하는 파트타임으로 일을 했고 $5,700를 벌었습니다. 귀하는 다른 소득이 없습니다. 귀하는 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족하기 때문에 귀하 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하의 부모는 다른 모든 요건을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 귀하 부모의 적격 자녀이기 때문에 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이는귀하의 부모가 EIC를 청구할 수 없거나 청구하지 않더라도 마찬가지입니다.
**신고서를 제출할 필요가 없는 사람의 자녀.**
귀하가 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족한 사람이 소득세 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없고 다음 조건 중 하나에 해당하는 경우, 귀하는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다 (따라서 EIC를 청구할 자격이 있을 수 있습니다).
  * 소득세 신고서 제출을 하지 않는 경우, 또는
  * 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출한 경우.


**예시 1-신고서를 제출할 필요가 없는 경우.**
이 사례는 지난 예와 동일합니다. 단, 귀하의 부모는 총소득이 없었고 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없으며 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않습니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 귀하는 다른 모든 요건을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 2—원천징수된 세금을 환급받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예 1과 같지만_ 귀하의 부모는 $1,500의 임금을 받았고, 부모의 임금에서 소득세를 원천징수했다는 점이 다릅니다. 귀하의 부모는 원천징수된 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출하고 EIC 또는 기타 세금 공제를 청구하지 않았습니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 귀하는 다른 모든 요건을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 3— EIC를 받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
이 사례는 _예 2와 같지만_ 귀하의 부모가 신고서에서 EIC를 청구했다는 점이 다릅니다. 부모가 EIC를 받기 위해 신고서를 제출했기 때문에, 원천징수된 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출하는 것이 아닙니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하는 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다.
## 3. 적격 자녀가 없는 경우의 규칙
적격 자녀가 없고 1장의 모든 규칙을 충족하는 경우 이 장을 사용하십시오. 이 장에서는 _규칙 11_ 에서 _규칙 14_ 를 설명합니다. 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 받으려면 1장 및 4장의 규칙 외에도 네 가지 규칙을 모두 충족해야 합니다. 1장과 이 장의 모든 규칙을 충족하는 경우, 4장을 읽고 다음에 무엇을 해야 하는지 알아보십시오.
**적격 자녀가 있다면.**
귀하가 _규칙 8_ 을 충족하면, 적격 자녀가 있습니다. 귀하가 _규칙 8_ 을 충족하고 적격 자녀와 함께 EIC를 청구하지 않으면, 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 자녀가 귀하의 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트를 충족하지만 다른 사람의 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트도 충족하는 경우, 한 명만 자녀를 실제 적격 자녀로 취급하여 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다. 다른 사람이 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 적격 자녀 청구를 하는 경우 다른 적격 자녀가 없는 한 납세자로서 적격 자녀 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 그러나 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다._.
#### 규칙 11— 나이 요건에 반드시 부합해야 합니다
귀하는 2024년 말에 반드시 최소 만 25세 이상 65세 미만이여야 합니다. 귀하가 부부 공동 신고서를 제출한다면 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자는 2024년 말에 반드시 최소 만 25세 이상 65세 미만이여야 합니다. 배우자 중 한명이 해당 나이 테스트에 부합하다면 그 배우자가 누구인지는 상관없습니다.
귀하가 1959년 12월 31일 이후, 그리고 2000년 1월 2일 이전에 출생했다면 나이 테스트에 부합합니다. 귀하가 부부 공동 신고서를 제출한다면 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자가 1959년 12월 31일 이후, 그리고 2000년 1월 2일 이전에 출생했다면 나이 테스트에 부합합니다.
귀하나 배우자 둘다 나이 테스트에 부합하지 않는다면 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 "No" 를 기입하십시오.
**예시 1.**
귀하는 만 28세이며 미혼입니다. 나이 테스트에 부합합니다.
**예시 2—배우자가 나이 테스트에 부합함.**
귀하는 기혼이며 부부 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 귀하는 만 23세이며 귀하의 배우자는 만 27세입니다. 귀하의 배우자가 최소 만 25세, 그러나 만 65세 미만이기 때문에 나이 테스트에 부합합니다.
**배우자의 사망.**
2024년에 사망한 배우자와 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하가 2024년 말에 최소 만 25세 이상, 65세 미만였거나 귀하의 배우자가 사망 당시 나이가 최소 만 25세, 그러나 만 65세 미만이였다면 나이 테스트에 부합합니다.
귀하의 배우자는 자신의 25번째 생일 전날에 만 25세가 된 것으로 간주됩니다. 그러나 만 65에 이르는 규칙은 다릅니다. 귀하의 배우자는 65번째 생일이 되는 날에 만 65세가 됩니다.
귀하의 배우자가 2000년 1월 2전에 출생했더라도 사망 당시 나이가 최소 만 25세가 아니라면 2024년 말에 최소 만 25세가 되지 않은 것으로 고려됩니다.
_**예시 1.**_
귀하는 기혼이며 2024년 8월에 사망한 배우자와 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 귀하는 만 67세입니다. 귀하의 배우자는 2024년 11월에 만 65세가 되었을 것입니다. 귀하의 배우자가 사망 당시 만세 65세 미만이였으므로, 귀하는 나이 테스트에 부합합니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하의 배우자는 1999년 2월 14일에 출생했고 2023년 2월 13일에 사망했습니다. 귀하의 배우자는 사망 시에 만 25세로 고려됩니다.허나, 만약 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 2월 12일에 사망했다면, 사망 당시 만 25세가 아닌 것으로 고려되며 2024년 말에 최소 만 25세가 아닙니다.
**납세자의 사망.**
2024년에 사망한 납세자는 사망 당시 최소 만 25세 이상, 65세 미만였다면 연령 테스트를 충족합니다.
납세자는 본인의 25번째 생일 하루전에 만 25세가 된것으로 고려됩니다. 그러나 만 65에 이르는 규칙은 다릅니다. 납세자는 본인의 65번째 생일이 되는 날에 만 65세가 됩니다.
납세자가 2000년 1월 2전에 출생했더라도 사망 당시 나이가 최소 만 25세가 아니라면 2024년 말에 최소 만 25세가 되지 않은 것으로 고려됩니다.
#### 규칙 12- 귀하는 다른 사람의 부양가족이 될 수 없습니다
만약 공동 신고서를 제출하지 **않는** 경우, 귀하의 이름 하단에 "Someone can claim you as a dependent" (다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있음)이라는 확인란을 선택하지 **않으면** 이 규칙을 충족합니다.
만약 공동 신고서를 제출**하는** 경우, "Someone can claim you as a dependent" (다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있음) 또는 "Someone can claim your spouse as a dependent" (다른 사람이 귀하의 배우자를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있음)이라는 확인란을 선택하지 **않으면** 이 규칙을 충족합니다.
다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있는지 확실하지 않은 경우, 간행물 501에서 부양가족 청구 규칙을 읽어보십시오.
다른 사람이 신고서에서 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있지만 그렇게 하지 않은 경우에도, 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있는 사람이 소득세 신고서 제출 의무가 없어서 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않거나 혹은 오직 원청징수된 소득세 또는 납부한 추정세에 대한 환급을 청구하기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우가 아니라면, 귀하는 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 1.**
2024년에 귀하는 만 25세 미혼이고, 집에서 부모와 함께 살고 있었습니다. 귀하는 일을 했고 학생이 아니었습니다. 귀하는 $7,500를 벌었습니다. 귀하의 부모는 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 신고서를 제출할 때 “Someone can claim you as a dependent” (다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있음) 확인란을 선택하지 않을 경우에, 이 규칙을 충족합니다. 다른 모든 요건을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하가 $2,000를 벌었다는 점을 제외하고는 _예 1_ 과 동일합니다. 귀하의 부모는 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있지만 그러지 않기로 결정할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 이 규칙을 충족하지 않습니다. 귀하의 부모가 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구했을 수 있기 때문에 귀하는 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
**공동 신고서.**
기혼이며 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우 일반적으로 다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
그러나 귀하와 배우자가 단지 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정세의 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 다른 사람이 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다. 그러나 귀하가 공동 신고서에서 EIC를 청구하는 경우 귀하나 배우자 모두 다른 사람에 의해 부양가족으로 청구될 수 없습니다.
**예시 1—원천징수된 세금을 환급받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
귀하는 만 26세입니다. 귀하와 배우자는 부모와 함께 살고 있으며 파트타임으로 $800의 임금을 받고 있고 다른 소득은 없습니다. 둘 다 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 됩니다. 귀하는 자녀가 없습니다. 세금은 급여에서 공제되었으므로 원천징수된 세금만 환급받기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 귀하가 공동 신고서를 제출했다고 해서 귀하의 부모가 귀하를 부양가족으로 청구할 자격이 박탈되는 것은 아닙니다.
**예시 2— EIC를 받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
귀하의 급여에서 세금이 원천징수되지 않았다는 점을 제외하고는 _예 1_ 과 동일합니다. 또한, 귀하와 귀하의 아내는 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없지만 공동 신고서를 제출하여 $63의 EIC를 청구하고 해당 금액을 환급받을 수 있습니다. 신고서를 제출하는 이유이기 EIC를 청구하는 것이기 때문에 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 청구하기 위해서만 신고서를 제출하는 것이 아닙니다. 따라서 귀하의 부모는 귀하 또는 귀하의 아내를 부양가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
#### 규칙 13-귀하는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 될 수 없습니다
아래의 진술이 모두 사실인 경우 귀하는 다른 납세자 (귀하의 부모, 보호자, 양부모 등)의 적격 자녀입니다.
  1. 귀하는 해당 납세자의 아들, 딸, 의붓 자녀, 위탁 자녀 또는 그 중 한 명의 자녀입니다. 또는 그 사람의 형제, 자매, 이복/이부/의붓 형제, 이복/이부/의붓 자매 또는 그중 한 명의 자녀입니다. 
  2. 귀하가
    1. 연말에 만 19세 미만이며 해당 납세자 (또는 공동 신고의 경우 그 사람의 배우자)보다 어린 경우.
    2. 연말에 만 24세 미만이며 해당 납세자 (또는 공동 신고의 경우 그 사람의 배우자)보다 어린 경우.
    3. 연령에 상관없이 영구적으로 완전히 장애가 있는 경우.
  3. 귀하는 해당 납세자와 1년 중 절반 이상 미국에서 함께 살았습니다.
  4. 귀하는 해당 연도 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 사람 (또는 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 사람)입니다.


적격 자녀가 되기 위한 테스트에 대한 자세한 내용은 [규칙 8](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000297706 "규칙 8— 귀하의 자녀는 반드시 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족해야 합니다")을 참고하십시오. 
귀하가 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀인 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이는 귀하를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있는 사람이 EIC를 청구하지 않거나 EIC를 청구하기 위한 모든 규칙을 충족하지 않는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 “No” 를 입력합니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 일년 내내 부모와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 26세이고, 미혼이며, 영구적이고 완전한 장애가 있습니다. 귀하의 유일한 소득은 커뮤니티 센터에서 일주일에 3일 전화를 받는 것이 였습니다. 귀하는 일년 동안 $5,000를 벌었고 본인 부양비의 절반 이상을 제공했습니다. 귀하는 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족하기 때문에 귀하의 부모가 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하의 부모는 다른 모든 요건을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀이기 때문에 본인은 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이는 부모가 EIC를 청구할 수 없거나 청구하지 않더라도 마찬가지입니다.
**공동 신고서.**
기혼이며 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우 일반적으로 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 될 수 없습니다.
그러나 귀하와 배우자가 단지 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 귀하가 공동 신고서에서 EIC를 청구하는 경우 귀하나 배우자 모두 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 될 수 없습니다.
**신고서를 제출할 필요가 없는 사람의 자녀.**
귀하가 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족한 사람이 소득세 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없고 다음 조건 중 하나에 해당하는 경우, 귀하는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다 (따라서 EIC를 청구할 자격이 있을 수 있습니다).
  * 소득세 신고서 제출을 하지 않는 경우, 또는
  * 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부된 추정 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출한 경우.


**예시 1-신고서가 필요 없는 경우.**
귀하는 일년 내내 부모와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 27세이고, 미혼이며, 영구적이고 완전한 장애가 있으며, $13,000의 소득이 있습니다. 다른 소득이 없고 자녀가 없으며 본인 부양비의 절반 이상을 제공했습니다. 귀하의 부모는 총소득이 없었고 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없으며 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않습니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 다른 모든 요구 사항을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 2—원천징수된 세금을 환급받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
귀하의 아버지가 $1,500를 벌었고 임금에서 소득세가 원천징수되었다는 점을 제외하고는 _예시 1_ 과 동일합니다. 아버지는 원천징수된 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출하고 EIC 또는 기타 세금 공제를 청구하지 않았습니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 아버지의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 다른 모든 요구 사항을 충족하는 경우 EIC를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 3— EIC를 받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.**
귀하의 부모가 신고서에서 EIC를 청구했다는 점을 제외하면 _예시 2_ 와 동일합니다. 부모가 EIC를 받기 위해 신고서를 제출했기 때문에, 원천징수된 소득세의 환급을 위해서만 신고서를 제출하는 것이 아닙니다. 그 결과, 귀하는 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하는 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다.
#### 규칙 14— 1년 중 절반 이상 미국에 거주했어야 합니다
귀하의 집 (과 배우자의 집, 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우)이 일년의 절반 이상 미국에 있어야 합니다. 
그렇지 않은 경우, “No” 를 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 입력합니다.
**미국.**
미국은 50개 주와 컬럼비아 특별구를 의미합니다. 푸에르토리코 또는 괌과 같은 미국 영토는 포함되지 않습니다.
**노숙자 보호소.**
귀하의 집은 귀하가 규칙적으로 주거하는 모든 장소가 될 수 있습니다. 전통적인 집은 필요하지 않습니다. 귀하가 미국에서 한 곳 이상의 노숙자 보호소에서 반년 이상 거주했다면, 귀하는 이 규칙을 충족합니다. 
**미국 외 지역에서 복무하는 군인.**
현역 복무의 연장으로 미국 외 지역에서 복무하는 미군 (2장의 설명 참조)에 대해 EIC는 해당 복무 기간 동안 미국에 거주하는 것으로 간주합니다. 
## 4. EIC 산정 및 청구
EIC를 청구하려면 한 가지 규칙을 더 충족해야 합니다.
귀하가 이 장의 규칙을 충족하는지 확인하려면 귀하의 근로 소득 금액을 알아야 합니다. 또한, EIC를 산정을 위해서 해당 금액을 알아야 합니다.
#### 규칙 15-근로 소득 한도
귀하의 근로 소득은 다음보다 낮아야 합니다:
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 3명 이상일 경우, $59,899 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $66,819),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 2명 이상일 경우 $55,768(부부 공동 신고의 경우 $62,688),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 한 명일 경우, $49,084 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $56,004),
  * 유효한 SSN이 있는 적격 자녀가 없을 경우, $18,591 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 $25,511).


#### 근로 소득
근로 소득은 일반적으로 임금, 급여, 팁, 기타 과세 대상 직원 급여 및 자영업의 순이익을 의미합니다. 직원 급여는 과세 대상인 경우에만 근로 소득입니다. 특정 부양가족 혜택 및 입양 혜택와 같은 비과세 직원 급여는 소득이 아닙니다. 하지만 비과세 전투 수당에 대한 예외가 있어, 근로 소득에 포함하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 근로 소득에 대한 자세한 내용은 1장에서 _규칙 7_ 을 참고하십시오. 
**근로 소득 산정.**
귀하가 자영업자, 법정 직원, 또는 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 제출하는 성직자 또는 교회 직원인 경우, 라인 27에 대한 지침을 위해 양식 1040의 5단계에 있는 작업표와 양식 1040 설명에 있는 EIC 작업표의 파트 B를 작성하면 귀하의 근로 소득을 계산할 수 있습니다. 5단계에 있는 작업표를 작성하기 전에 [_성직자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298604 "성직자.") 또는 [_교회 직원_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298605 "교회 직원.") 둘 중 해당되는 내용 참조를 명심하십시오. 
_**성직자.**_
귀하가 스케줄 SE를 제출하는 성직자이고 해당 스케줄 라인 2의 금액이 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 라인 1z에 신고된 금액을 포함하는 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 라인 1z의 금액에서 해당 금액을 차감한 후 그 결과를 라인 27에 대한 양식 1040 지침, _5단계_ 의 작업표 라인 1에 입력합니다. 라인 27 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR) 옆의 점선에 “Clergy” (성직자)를 기입하십시오. 
_**교회 직원.**_
교회 직원이란 교회 또는 적격 교회 관리 조직의 직원 (목사 또는 종교 교단 구성원 제외)을 의미하며, 고용주의 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금이 면제됩니다. 교회 직원으로 임금을 받았고 스케줄 SE의 라인 5a와 양식 1040, 라인 1a에 있는 금액을 모두 포함하는 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 라인 1a의 금액에서 해당 금액을 차감한 후 그 결과를 라인 27에 대한 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 지침 _5단계_ 의 작업표 라인 1에 입력하십시오. 
_**메디케어 포기 지급금.**_
양식 1040 지침 라인 27의 _5단계_ 에 있는 작업표를 작성할 때, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8s의 소득에서 제외시킨 메디케어 포기 지급금을 입력하십시오. 만약 이것을 근로 소득에 포함시키도록 선택했다면 -0-을 입력하십시오. 이 지급금에 대한 더 자세한 정보는 간행물 525를 참고하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 메디케어 포기 지급금은 이미 양식(들) W-2, 박스12, 코드 II에 보고되었을 수 있습니다._.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_이번 연도에 귀하와 배우자 둘다 모두 메디케어 포기 지급금을 받았다면, 이 지급금 총액을 근로 소득에 포함시키는 것이 아닌 다른 선택도 할 수 있습니다. 귀하 또는 배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출한다면 근로 소득에 포함시키는 것을 원하지 않은 메디케어 포기 지급금의 금액만을 입력하십시오. 비과세 메디케어 포기 지급금의 총액을 근로 소득에 포함시키려면 -0-를 입력하십시오._.
_**비과세 전투 수당.**_
EIC에 대한 근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이를 선택하는 경우, 귀하가 받은 모든 비과세 전투 수당을 근로 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
귀하가 공동 신고서를 제출하고 귀하와 배우자가 모두 비과세 전투 수당을 받은 경우, 각각 선택할 수 있습니다. 즉, 둘 중 한 명이 선택하면 다른 한 명도 선택을 할 수 있지만 그럴 필요는 없습니다.
비과세 전투 수당 금액은 양식 W-2의 박스 12에 코드 Q와 함께 표시되어야 합니다.
근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택하면 EIC가 증가 혹은 감소할 수 있습니다. 선택을 하기 전에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하거나 포함하지 않은 공제를 산정합니다. 선택이 귀하의 EIC를 증가 또는 감소시키는지 여부는 귀하의 총소득, 납세자 구분 및 적격 자녀 수에 따라 달라집니다. 전투 수당이 없을 때의 근로 소득이 자녀 수 아래에 표시된 금액보다 적은 경우, 근로 소득에 비과세 전투 수당을 포함하도록 선택하면 혜택을 받을 수 있으며 두 가지 방법을 모두 고려해야 합니다. 전투 수당을 포함하지 않았을 때의 근로 소득이 이 금액과 같거나 그 이상이면 근로 소득에 전투 수당을 포함했을 때의 혜택이 없습니다.
  * 유효한 SSN을 가진 자녀가 없는 경우 $8,260.
  * 자녀가 한 명인 경우 $12,370.
  * 자녀가 2명 이상인 경우 $17,400.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_비과세 전투 수당을 사용해 EIC를 산정하도록 선택한다면, 이 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040–SR, 라인1i에 입력하십시오._.
#### IRS가 귀하를 위해 EIC를 산정해줄 것입니다
양식 1040에 대한 지침에 있는 라인 27에 대한 지침을 따르면 IRS가 귀하를 위해 EIC를 산정해 줄것입니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_자격이 되지 않는다면, IRS에 EIC 산정을 요청하지 마십시오. 자격이 되려면, 이 장의 규칙 15 와 1장의 규칙 및 2장 또는 3장의 규칙 중 귀하에게 적용되는 규칙에 부합해야 합니다. 1996년 이후 어느 한 연도에 라도 세액공제가 감소되거나 불허된 경우, 5장의 규칙이 적용될 수 있습니다._.
#### EIC를 본인이 직접 산정하는 방법
EIC를 본인이 직접 산정하려면 양식 1040의 지침에 있는 EIC 작업표를 사용하십시오. 적격 자녀가 있는 경우, 스케줄 EIC (이 장 후반의 논의되는)를 작성하여 세금 신고서에 첨부하십시오.
IRS는 귀하의 EIC를 산정하기를 원한다면, 이전의 [_IRS가 귀하를 위해 EIC를 산정해줄 것입니다_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000109793)를 참고하십시오.
#### 특별 설명-EIC 작업표
EIC 금액을 산정하기 위해, EIC 작업표 A 또는 EIC 작업표 B 사용 여부를 결정해야 합니다. 이 섹션은 이러한 작업표를 사용하는 방법과 신고서에서 EIC를 신고하는 방법에 대해 설명합니다.
**EIC 작업표 A.**
2024년에 자영업을 한 적이 없고, 성직자, 스케줄 SE를 제출하는 교회 직원 또는 스케줄 C를 제출하는 법정 직원이 아닌 경우 EIC 작업표 A를 사용하십시오. 
**EIC 작업표 B.**
2024년에 어느 시점에라도 자영업자였고 성직자, 스케줄 SE를 제출하는 교회 직원 또는 스케줄 C를 제출하는 법정 직원의 경우 EIC 작업표 B를 사용하십시오. 다음 중 해당하는 경우가 있다면, 단락을 읽고 EIC 작업표 B를 작성하십시오. 
_**자영업의 순이익이 $400 이상인 경우.**_
자영업 순이익이 $400 이상인 경우 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 올바르게 작성하고 적절한 자영업 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 받을 자격이 있는 EIC의 전액을 받지 못할 수 있습니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_자영업의 순이익을 산정할 때는 허용된 사업 경비를 모두 청구해야 합니다._.
_**순이익을 산정할때 선택적 방법을 사용해야 하는 시기.**_
스케줄 SE의 선택적 방법을 사용하여 자영업의 순이익을 산정하면 EIC 자격을 얻거나 더 큰 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 순이익 (선택적 방법을 사용하지 않았을 때)이 $6,920 미만인 경우, 선택적 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 스케줄 SE의 지침을 참고하십시오. 
_**부부 두 사람 모두 자영업 소득이 있는 경우.**_
다음 모든 조건이 적용되는 경우 EIC 작업표 B의 파트 1과 파트 2를 모두 작성해야 합니다.
  1. 부부 공동 신고를 하는 경우.
  2. 귀하와 배우자 모두 자영업 소득이 있습니다.
  3. 귀하 또는 배우자는 스케줄 SE를 제출하고 둘 중 한 명은 스케줄 SE를 제출하지 않습니다. 


**법정 직원.**
법정 직원은 스케줄 C에 임금과 경비를 신고합니다. 법정 직원은 스케줄 SE를 제출하지 않습니다. 귀하가 법정 직원의 경우, EIC 작업표 B를 작성할 때 스케줄 C의 파트 3에 있는 라인 1에 금액을 입력하십시오. 
#### 스케줄 EIC
적격 자녀가 있고 EIC를 청구하는 경우, 스케줄 EIC를 작성하여 세금 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 스케줄 EIC는 적격 자녀에 대한 정보를 IRS에 제공합니다. 여기에는 자녀의 이름, 연령, SSN, 귀하와의 관계 및 자녀가 귀하와 한 해 동안 함께 살았던 시간이 포함됩니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_스케줄 EIC를 작성하고 첨부해야 하지만 첨부하지 않은 경우, 환급 처리 및 지급에 더 오랜 시간이 소요됩니다._.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 적격 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없더라도 스케줄 EIC를 작성하고 세금 신고서에 첨부하십시오. 귀하의 적격 자녀가 유효한 SSN이 없을 경우 스케줄 EIC 작성하는 방법에 대한 정보는 스케줄 EIC를 참고하십시오._.
## 5. EIC 불허
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_1996년 이후 그 어느 연도에 EIC가 IRS에 의해 거부 (불허)되거나 감소된 경우, 2024년에 이 세액공제를 청구하려면 추가 양식을 작성해야 할 수 있습니다._.
이 장은 1996년 이후 연도에 EIC가 IRS에 의해 거부되거나 감소된 사람들을 위한 정보를 제공합니다. 이 상황이 본인에게 적용되는 경우, 2024년 세액공제를 청구하기 위해 양식 8862, ‘불허 후 특정 세액공제를 청구하기 위한 정보’를 작성하고 2024년 신고서에 첨부해야 될 수 있습니다. 이 장에서는 양식 8862를 첨부해야 할 상황의 예를 설명합니다. 자세한 내용은 양식 8862 및 지침을 참고하십시오.
이 장에서는 EIC가 거부되거나 감소한 후 여러 해 동안 EIC를 청구할 수 없는 특정 사람들을 위한 규칙도 설명합니다.
#### 양식 8862
1996년 이후의 계산 또는 서류상의 오류 이외의 이유로 EIC가 거부되거나 감소된 경우, EIC를 청구하려면 반드시 양식 8862를 작성해서 다음 연도 세금 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 또한 본 간행물에 설명된 모든 규칙을 충족하여 EIC를 청구할 수 있는 자격을 갖추어야 합니다.
**예외 1.**
아래의 (1) 또는 (2)가 사실인 경우 양식 8862를 제출하지 마십시오.
  1. 이전 연도에 EIC가 감소되거나 불허된 후,
    1. 귀하는 이후 연도에 양식 8862를 제출했고 이후 연도의 EIC가 허용된 경우, 그리고
    2. 계산 또는 서류상의 오류 이외의 이유로 또 다시 EIC가 감소 또는 불허된 적이 없었던 경우.
  2. 2024년에 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구하며, EIC가 이전 해에 감소되거나 불허된 유일한 이유는 스케줄 EIC에 나열된 자녀가 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아니라고 IRS가 판단했기 때문인 경우.


이 모든 경우에, EIC 자격 요건을 모두 충족하는 경우 양식 8862를 제출하지 않아도 EIC를 받을 수 있습니다.
**예외 2.**
양식 8862를 제출하지 않거나 또는 EIC를
  * 귀하의 EIC 청구가 무모하거나 의도적으로 EIC 규칙을 무시했다는 최종 결정이 내려진 이후 2년 동안 받지 않았을 경우, 또는 
  * 귀하의 EIC 청구가 사기 때문이라는 최종 결정이 내려진 이후 10년 동안 받지 않았을 경우. 


**추가 정보.**
자세한 내용은 이 장에서 [_여러 해 동안 EIC 청구가 금지되어 있습니까?_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p596ko#en_US_2024_publink1000298697 "여러 해 동안 EIC 청구가 금지되어 있습니까? ")를 보십시오.
EIC가 거부된 날짜와 2024년 신고서를 제출한 날짜는, 양식 8862를 2024년 신고서에 첨부해야 하는지 또는 이 다음 연도 신고서에 첨부해야하는지 여부에 영향을 미칩니다. 다음 예제는 양식 8862가 2024년 또는 2025년 중 언제 요구되는지 설명합니다.
**예시 1-양식 8862가 2024년에 요구되는 경우.**
귀하는 2024년 3월에 2023년 세금 신고서를 제출하고 적격 자녀를 포함한 EIC를 청구했습니다. IRS는 EIC에 대해 의문을 제기했으며, 귀하는 귀하의 자녀가 적격 자녀임을 증명할 수 없었습니다. 2024년 9월, 귀하는 90일 이내에 조세 법원에 항소를 제기하지 않는 한 조정이 이루어지고 세금이 부과된다는 법정 추징세 고지서를 받았습니다. 귀하는 90일 이내에 이 고지서에 대해 조치를 취하지 않았습니다. 따라서, 귀하의 EIC는 2024년 12월에 거부되었습니다. 2024년 신고서에 적격 자녀를 포함한 EIC를 청구하려면 양식 8862를 작성하고 첨부해야 합니다. 그러나 2024년 신고서에 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구하려면 양식 8862를 제출할 필요가 없습니다.
**예시 2-양식 8862가 2025년에 요구되는 경우.**
이 사례는 2025년 2월에 법정 추징세 고지서를 받았다는 점을 제외하고는 이전 사례와 동일합니다. 2024년 신고서를 제출할 준비가 되었을 때 법정 추징세 고지서에 언급된 90일의 기간이 끝나지 않았기 때문에 2024년 신고서에 양식 8862를 첨부해서는 안 됩니다. 그러나 2025년 신고서를 제출 시 적격 자녀를 포함하여 EIC를 청구하려면 그해에 양식 8862를 작성하고 첨부해야 합니다. 2025년에 적격 자녀 없이 EIC를 청구하려면 양식 8862를 제출할 필요가 없습니다.
**계산 또는 서류상의 오류에 대한 예외.**
EIC가 계산 또는 서류상의 오류로 인해 거부 또는 감소된 경우, 양식 8862를 다음 세금 신고서에 첨부하지 않습니다. 예를 들어, 귀하의 계산이 부정확하면 IRS는 수정할 수 있습니다. 정확한 SSN을 제공하지 않으면 IRS는 EIC를 거부할 수 있습니다. 이러한 종류의 오류를 계산 또는 서류상의 오류라고 합니다. 
**양식 8862의 누락.**
2024년 세금 신고서에 양식 8862의 첨부가 요구되지만 작성된 양식 8862를 첨부하지 않고 EIC를 청구하는 경우 이 청구는 자동으로 거부될 것입니다. 이는 계산 또는 서류상의 오류로 간주됩니다. 작성된 양식 8862 없이는 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다.
**추가 서류가 요구될 수 있습니다.**
신고서에 정확하게 작성된 양식 8862를 첨부하더라도 청구한 EIC와 관련된 환급이 처리되기 전에 IRS에 추가 서류 또는 정보를 제공해야 할 수 있습니다.
#### 여러 해 동안 EIC 청구가 금지되어 있습니까?
1996년 이후에 EIC가 거부되고 귀하의 오류가 무모하거나 의도적으로 EIC 규칙을 무시한 것으로 판단되면 향후 2년 동안 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 사기로 인해 오류가 발생한 경우 향후 10년 동안 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. EIC가 거부된 날짜와 2024년 신고서를 제출한 날짜는 EIC 청구 금지 연도에 영향을 미칩니다. 다음 예시는 귀하의 EIC 청구 금지 연도를 보여줍니다.
**예시 3-EIC 청구가 2년 동안 금지된 경우.**
귀하는 2024년 3월에 제출한 2023년 세금 신고서에서 EIC를 청구했습니다. IRS는 귀하가 EIC에 적격하지 않으며 귀하의 오류가 무모하거나 의도적으로 EIC 규칙을 무시한 것으로 판단했습니다. 2024년 9월, 귀하는 90일 이내에 조세 법원에 항소를 제기하지 않는 한 조정이 이루어지고 세금이 부과된다는 법정 추징세 고지서를 받았습니다. 귀하는 90일 이내에 이 고지서에 대해 조치를 취하지 않았습니다. 따라서, 귀하의 EIC는 2024년 12월에 거부되었습니다. 과세 연도 2024년 또는 2025년에 대한 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 2026년 신고서에 EIC를 청구하려면, 해당 연도의 신고서에 양식 8862를 작성하여 첨부해야 합니다.
**예시 4.**
2023년에 대한 EIC가 2024년 신고서를 제출할 때까지 거부되지 않았다는 점을 제외하면 _예 3_ 과 동일합니다. 과세 연도 2025년 또는 2026년에 대한 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 2027년 신고서에 EIC를 청구하려면, 해당 연도의 신고서에 양식 8862를 작성하여 첨부해야 합니다.
**예시 5-EIC 청구가 10년 동안 금지된 경우.**
귀하는 2024년 2월에 제출한 2023년 세금 신고서에서 EIC를 청구했습니다. IRS는 귀하가 EIC에 적격하지 않으며 귀하의 오류가 사기로 인해 발생했다고 판단했습니다. 2024년 9월, 귀하는 90일 이내에 조세 법원에 탄원을 제출하지 않는 한 조정이 이루어지고 세금이 부과된다는 법정 추징세 고지서를 받았습니다. 귀하는 90일 이내에 이 고지서에 대해 조치를 취하지 않았습니다. 따라서, 귀하의 EIC는 2024년 12월에 거부되었습니다. 과세 연도 2024년에서 2033년까지 EIC를 청구할 수 없습니다. 2034년 신고서에 EIC를 청구하려면, 해당 연도의 신고서에 양식 8862를 작성하여 첨부해야 합니다.
일정 기간 동안 EIC 청구가 금지된다는 IRS의 최종 결정에 동의하지 않고 이 결정에 대해 이의를 제기하려는 경우 양식 8862, _청구 불허 기간에 대한 항소 제기하는 방법_ 에 대한 지침을 참조하십시오.
## 6. 상세한 예시
다음 페이지에는 EIC 청구에 대해 궁금한 점이 있는 경우 도움이 될 수 있는 두 가지 자세한 예시가 포함되어 있습니다.
#### 예시 1—재이미 스미스
재이미 스미스는 만 63세로 은퇴자입니다. 재이미는 한 해 동안 $7,000의 사회 보장 혜택을 받았고, 파트타임로 $17,000를 받았습니다. 또한, $7,400의 과세 대상 연금을 받았습니다. 재이미는 다른 소득이 없습니다. 재이미의 AGI는 양식 1040, 라인 11의 $24,400 ($17,000 + $7,400)입니다.
재이미는 결혼하지 않았고 1년 내내 미국에서 혼자 살았습니다. 재이미는 다른 사람의 신고서 청구에 부양가족으로 청구될 수 없으며 투자 소득이 없고 적격 자녀가 없습니다.
재이미는 양식 1040의 지침에서 자격 요건을 위한 단계를 읽습니다. 재이미는 _1단계_ 에서 자신의 AGI ($24,400)가 $18,591 보다 적지 않기 때문에 EIC를 받을 수 없다는 것을 알게 됩니다. 재이미는 나머지 양식 1040을 작성하여 IRS에 제출합니다.
#### 예시 2—카메론과 조단 그레이
카메론과 조단 그레이는 만 10세와 만 8세인 두 명의 자녀를 두고 있습니다. 카메론과 조단은 아이들과 2024년 내내 함께 살았습니다. 카메론은 $15,000, 조단은 $18,030의 임금을 받았습니다. 그레이 부부는 저축 계좌에서 $525의 이자를 받았습니다. 2024년에 그 외의 다른 소득이 없습니다.
카메론과 조단은 2024년 양식 1040 및 지침을 가지고 있습니다. 그들은 EIC 적격 여부를 확인하고 싶어 합니다. 따라서 양식 1040의 지침에 있는 라인 27에 대한 단계를 따릅니다.
**1단계.**
카메론과 조단은 양식 1040, 라인 11에 입력한 금액은 $33,555였습니다. 둘 다 유효한 SSN을 오래전부터 가지고 있었습니다. 이들은 결혼했으며 공동 신고서를 제출할 것입니다. 카메론과 조단은 둘 다 비거주 외국인이 아닙니다. 따라서 _1단계_ 질문에 대한 답변은 그들이 _2단계_ 로 진행하도록 허용합니다. 
**2단계.**
그레이 부부의 유일한 투자 소득은 $525의 이자 소득입니다. 해당 금액은 $11,600를 넘지 않기 때문에 _2단계_ 의 두 번째 질문에 “No” 라고 답변한 후 _3단계_ 로 이동합니다.
**3단계.**
그들의 자녀는 관계, 연령, 거주 및 공동 신고서 테스트를 충족하여 카메론과 조단의 적격 자녀가 됩니다. 그래서 카메론과 조단은 _3단계_ 의 첫 번째 질문에 “Yes” 라고 답변합니다. 이들의 자녀는 다른 누구의 적격 자녀도 아닙니다. 두 아이 모두 출생 직후 발급받은 유효한 SSN을 가지고 있습니다. 카메론과 조단은 공동 신고서를 제출하고 있으므로 _3단계_ 의 두 번째 질문에 “Yes” 라고 답변합니다. 즉, 질문 3과 _4단계_ 를 건너뛸 수 있으며 _5단계_ 로 이동합니다.
**5단계.**
카메론과 조단은 자신들이 번 금액을 합산 입금인 $33,030 라고 산정했습니다. 이 금액이 $62,688 보다 적기 때문에 _6단계_ 로 이동하여 세액공제를 산정합니다.
**6단계.**
카메론과 조단은 EIC를 직접 산정하고 싶어 하므로 양식 1040 지침에서 EIC 작업표를 작성합니다.
**EIC 작업표 작성하기.**
카메론과 조단은 다음과 같이 작업표를 작성합니다.
  1. 카메론과 조단은 총 근로 소득 ($33,030)을 라인 1에 입력합니다.
  2. 세액공제를 찾기 위해 EIC 표로 이동합니다. 카메론과 조단은 $33,000에서 $33,050 사이의 범위에서 그들의 소득인 $33,030를 찾습니다. 두 자녀 모두 유효한 SSN이 있기 때문에 이 줄을 따라 _부부 공동 신고 아래의 아동 2명용 열로 이동하여_ $6,247를 찾을 수 있습니다. 그들은 라인 2에 $6,247를 입력합니다.
  3. 그들의 AGI ($33,555)를 라인 3에 입력하고 라인 1의 금액과 다르다는 것을 확인합니다.
  4. EIC 표에서 $33,555를 찾고 라인 5에 $6,131를 입력합니다.
  5. 그들은 라인 6에 $6,131를 입력합니다. 이것은 라인 2의 금액 ($6,247)과 라인 5의 금액 ($6,131) 중 더 작은 값입니다.
  6. 그레이는 양식 1040의 라인 27에 $6,131를 입력합니다. 이제 스케줄 EIC (나중에 설명)를 작성하여 신고서에 첨부합니다. 그들은 기록을 위해 EIC 작업표를 보관합니다.
