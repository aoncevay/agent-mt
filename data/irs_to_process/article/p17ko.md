**납세자 구분 이름이 적격 생존 배우자로 변경 됨.** 납세자 구분 적격 미망인을 이제 적격 생존 배우자라고 부릅니다. 해당 납세자 구분에 대한 규칙은 바뀌지 않았습니다. 적격 미망인에 적용되었던 똑같은 규칙들이 적격 생존 배우자에게 적용됩니다.
**양식 1040 및 1040-SR의 라인 1a~1z.** 2022년부터 라인 1가 확장되어 새 라인 1a~1z가 추가되었습니다. 이전 연도에 양식 1040에 신고됐었던 몇몇 금액과 양식 1040–SR에 신고됐었던 몇몇 금액들은 이제 스케줄 1에 신고됩니다.

**보험료 세액공제 (PTC).** ARP법은 납세자의 가정 소득이 연방 빈민자 기준의 400%를 넘지 못하게 하는 제한을 삭제시켰으며 일반적으로 세액공제 금액을 증가하도록 PTC를 확장했습니다. 더 많은 정보는 간행물 974 및 양식 8962와 이에 대한 지침을 보십시오.
**특정 자영업 개인들을 위한 병가 및 가족 휴직에 대한 세액공제 사용 불가.** 2021년 4월 1일 이전에 사용한 휴직과 2021년 3월 31일 이후 및 2021년 10월 1일 이전에 사용한 휴직에 대해 2023년에 지급된 적격 병가 및 가족 휴직 임금에 대한 세액공제는 이제 스케줄 3, 라인 13z에 신고됩니다. 자세한 내용은 스케줄 H (양식 1040) 를 참조하십시오.

IR-2021–228에서 더 많은 정보를 보십시오.
**입양 세액공제.** 입양 세액공제와 고용주 제공 입양 혜택 소득 제외는 2024년 적격 아동 한명 당 $16,810입니다. 귀하의 변경된 AGI가 $252,150을 초과하는 경우 이 금액은 단계적으로 삭감되기 시작하며, 변경된 AGI가 $292,150 이상인 경우 완전히 삭감됩니다.

**경솔한 세금 제출물.** IRS는 납세자가 취하는 입장 중에서 경솔한 것으로 판단한 사안의 목록을 발표하였습니다. 경솔한 세금 신고서 제출에 따른 과징금은 $5,000입니다. 또한 이 $5,000 과징금은 그 외의 지정된 경솔 제출 사안에 대해서도 적용됩니다. 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_민사 처벌_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170712 "민사 처벌")을 참조하십시오.

**총소득.**
현금, 재화, 부동산 및 서비스 형태로 받은 모든 면세가 아닌 소득을 포함합니다. 또한 미국 이외의 국가에서 얻은 소득 또는 귀하의 주된 주택 판매에서 얻은 소득 (소득의 전부 또는 일부는 제외할 수 있더라도)을 포함합니다. 다음의 경우 사회보장 혜택의 일부를 포함시켜야 합니다.
  1. 기혼이며 부부 개별 신고서를 제출하고 2024년에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있거나, 
  2. 귀하의 사회보장 혜택의 절반액에 그 외의 총소득 및 면세 이자를 더한 금액이 $25,000 (부부 공동 신고를 할 경우 $32,000)를 초과할 경우.


(1) 또는 (2)가 적용되는 경우, 총소득에 포함시켜야 할 사회보장 혜택을 산정하기 위해 양식 1040 또는 간행물 915를 참조하십시오.
일반적인 소득의 종류는 본 간행물 [_파트 둘_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171197 "소득 및 소득 조정 사항")에 제시되어 있습니다. 
_**공동 재산 인정 주.**_
공동 재산을 인정하는 주에는 애리조나, 캘리포니아, 아이다호, 루이지애나, 네바다, 뉴멕시코, 텍사스, 워싱턴 및 위스콘신이 포함됩니다. 귀하 또는 배우자가 공동 재산 인정 주에 거주한 경우, 통상적으로 주법에 따라 공동 재산과 개별 소득을 구분해야 합니다. 자세한 사항은 양식 8958 및 간행물 555를 참조하십시오. 
_**네바다, 워싱턴, 및 캐나다의 동거인.**_
네바다, 워싱턴 또는 캐나다에 등록된 동거인의 경우, 일반적으로 한 개인과 그들의 동거인의 소득을 합산한 공동 소득의 절반액을 신고해야 합니다. 간행물 555를 참조하십시오.
_**자영업 개인.**_
자영업자의 경우, 귀하의 총소득은 스케줄 C (양식 1040), 영업 이익 또는 손실의 라인 7에 표시된 금액과 스케줄 F (양식 1040), 농업 이익 또는 손실의 라인 9에 표시된 금액을 포함합니다. 세금 신고 요건에 관한 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_자영업자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170425 "자영업자")를 참조하십시오. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_자영업 소득을 전부 신고하지 않을 경우, 은퇴 후에 사회보장 혜택이 줄어들 수 있습니다._.
**납세자 구분.**
귀하의 납세자 구분은 기혼 또는 미혼 여부 및 가족이 처한 상황에 따라 결정됩니다. 납세자 구분은 대부분의 납세자에게 있어 12월 31일인 과세 연도 마지막 날에 결정됩니다. 각 납세자 구분에 관한 설명은 [2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170734 "납세자 구분")을 참조하십시오.
**나이.**
연말에 만 65세 이상이였다면 일반적으로 다른 납세자들보다 세금을 신고해야 하는 기준점의 총소득이 높아집니다. [표 1-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170407 "표 1-1. 대부분의 납세자를 위한 2024년 세금 신고 요건             ")을 참조하십시오. 65번째 생일 전날부터 만 65세로 간주됩니다. 예를 들어, 65번째 생일이 2025년 1월 1일이라면 2024년에 대해 만 65세로 간주됩니다.
###### 표 1-1. **대부분의 납세자를 위한 2024년 세금 신고 요건**

---|---  
** | 총소득은 면세 대상이 아닌 현금, 물건, 부동산 및 서비스 형태로 받은 모든 소득을 의미하며, 미국 이외의 국가에서 얻은 소득 또는 귀하의 주된 주택 판매에서 얻은 소득 (소득의 일부 또는 전부를 제외할 수 있더라도)을 포함합니다. 다음에 해당하는 경우를 제외하고는 사회보장 혜택은 포함시키지 마십시오. (a) 부부 개별 세금 신고를 하고 2024년에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있거나, (b) 귀하의 사회보장 혜택의 절반액에 그 외의 총소득 및 면세 이자를 더한 금액이 $25,000 (부부 공동 신고를 할 경우 $32,000)를 초과할 경우.

*** | 2024년 말 (또는 배우자와 사별한 날)에 배우자와 함께 살고 있지 않았으며 총소득이 적어도 $5 이상일 경우, 나이와 상관 없이 세금 신고를 해야 합니다.  
#### 생존 배우자, 집행인, 관리자, 및 법적 대변인

  * 귀하의 배우자가 2024년에 사망했거나 귀하가 생존 배우자, 집행인, 관리자 또는 법적 대변인일 경우.
  * 사망자가 사망일 기준 세금 신고 요건을 충족한 경우.


사망자의 최종 신고서 제출 규칙에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 559를 참조하십시오.
#### 해외에 거주하는 미국 시민 및 거주 외국인
세금 신고를 해야 하는지 여부를 알아보기 위해 해외 근로 소득 제외에 따라 제외할 수 있는 소득을 포함한 해외에서 벌어들인 모든 소득을 총소득에 포함시키십시오. 귀하에게 적용될 수 있는 특별세 규칙에 관한 정보는 간행물 54를 참조하십시오. 해당 간행물은 온라인 및 대부분의 미국 대사관과 영사관에서 구할 수 있습니다. 본 간행물 뒷면에 제시된 [_세금 관련 도움을 얻는 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100034313)을 참조하십시오.
#### 푸에르토리코 거주자
귀하가 미국 시민이자 푸에르토리코 실거주자인 경우, 일반적으로 소득 요건을 충족하는 모든 연도에 대하여 미국 소득세를 신고해야 합니다. 이는 푸에르토리코에 소득세를 신고해야 하는 모든 법적 의무에 더하여 부여되는 의무입니다.
1년간 푸에르토리코의 실거주자가 아니었다면 귀하의 미국 총소득에는 푸에르토리코 내에서 얻은 소득이 포함되지 않습니다. 그러나 미국 또는 미국 기관의 직원으로서 서비스를 제공한 대가로 얻은 소득은 포함됩니다. 미국 과세 대상에 해당하지 않는 푸에르토리코에 기반한 소득을 얻은 경우 표준 공제를 축소시켜야 합니다. 따라서 미국 소득세 세금 신고를 해야만 하는 기준 소득액은 [표 1-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170407 "표 1-1. 대부분의 납세자를 위한 2024년 세금 신고 요건             ") 또는 [표 1-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170430 "표 1-2. 부양 가족의 2024년 세금 신고 요건")에 따라 적용되는 금액보다 적습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 570을 참조하십시오.
####  미국 영토에서 발생한 소득이 있는 개인
괌, 북마리아 제도 연방, 아메리칸 사모아, 또는 미국령 버진아일랜드에서 발생한 소득이 있다면 미국 연방 소득세 신고를 해야 하는지 여부를 판단할 때 특별 규칙이 적용될 수 있습니다. 또한 개별 섬 정부에 세금을 신고해야 할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 570을 참조하십시오.
#### 부양 가족
본인이 부양 가족일 경우 ([3장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170839 "부양 가족")의 부양자 자격 판정 테스트를 통과하는 자) [표 1-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170430 "표 1-2. 부양 가족의 2024년 세금 신고 요건")를 참조하여 세금을 신고해야 하는지 여부를 알아보십시오. 귀하의 상황이 [표 1-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000284899 "표 1-3. 그 외의 2024년 세금 신고를 해야 하는 상황             ")에 기재된 설명에 해당할 경우에도 세금을 신고해야 합니다.
**부모의 책임.**
일반적으로 자녀는 자신의 세금 신고서를 직접 신고하고 신고서에 신고된 세금을 납부할 책임이 있습니다. 부양 자녀가 소득세 세금 신고를 해야 하는데 나이나 기타 이유로 인하여 신고하지 못할 경우, 부모, 대변인 또는 그 외의 법적 책임이 있는 자가 자녀를 대신하여 세금을 신고해야 합니다. 자녀가 신고서에 서명을 하지 못하는 경우, 부모 또는 대변인이 자녀의 이름으로 서명을 한 뒤 “By (your signature), parent for minor child (미성년자 자녀의 부모 (귀하의 서명))”라는 문구를 덧붙여야 합니다. 
_**자녀의 소득.**_
서비스를 제공한 대가로 자녀가 벌어들인 소득은 부모의 총소득이 아닌 자녀의 총소득에 포함됩니다. 이는 지역 법에 의해 자녀의 부모가 소득에 대한 권리를 갖으며 실제로 수령했다 하더라도 마찬가지로 적용됩니다. 그러나 자녀가 소득에 따른 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 그 책임은 부모에게 있습니다. 
#### 만 19세 미만 특정 자녀 또는 풀 타임 학생
자녀의 소득이 오직 이자 및 배당금 (자본이득 분배 및 알라스카 영구 기금 배당금 포함)에 해당하며, 자녀가 2024년 말 기준 만 19세 미만이거나 2024년 말 기준 만 24세 미만의 풀 타임 학생이고, 다른 특정 조건을 충족할 경우, 부모는 자녀의 소득을 부모의 세금 신고서에 포함하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 부모가 이러한 선택을 할 경우, 자녀는 세금을 신고하지 않아도 됩니다. 간행물 8814, ‘자녀의 이자 및 배당금을 부모가 신고하기로 선택’의 지침을 참조하십시오.
#### 자영업자
다음에 해당할 경우 귀하는 자영업자입니다.
  * 개인 사업자로서 상업이나 사업을 영위할 경우,
  * 독립 계약자일 경우,
  * 파트너쉽의 일원인 경우, 또는
  * 기타 다른 방식으로 개인 사업을 하고 있는 경우.


자영업에는 정규 근무 이외에 집에서 하는 특정 파트타임 일과 같이 정규 풀 타임 사업 활동 이외에 하는 일도 포함될 수 있습니다. 
귀하의 납세자 구분 및 나이에 따라 총소득이 ([표 1-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170407 "표 1-1. 대부분의 납세자를 위한 2024년 세금 신고 요건             ")에 제시된) 세금 신고가 요구되는 기준 금액 이상일 경우 세금을 신고해야 합니다. 또한 다음에 해당할 경우 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 및 스케줄 SE (양식 1040), 자영업세를 신고해야 합니다.
  1. 자영업에서 생긴 순수입 (교회 직원 소득 제외)이 $400 이상인 경우, 또는
  2. $108.28 이상의 교회 직원 소득이 발생한 경우. ([표 1-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000284899 "표 1-3. 그 외의 2024년 세금 신고를 해야 하는 상황             ")을 참조하십시오.)


스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 사용하여 귀하의 자영업세를 산정하십시오. 자영업세는 직원의 임금에서 원천징수되는 사회 보장 또는 메디케어 세금과 견줄 수 있습니다. 자영업세에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 334를 참조하십시오.
_**외국 정부 또는 국제 기구 직원.**_
귀하가 미국에서 국제 기구, 외국 정부, 또는 외국 정부가 전적으로 소유한 기구에 고용되어 일하는 미국 시민이며, 고용주가 임금에서 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금을 원천징수할 의무가 없는 경우, 자영업에서 생긴 순소득을 산정할 때 미국에서 서비스를 제공한 대가로 얻은 소득을 포함시켜야 합니다. 
_**목사.**_
자영업세 면제를 받지 않은 이상 자영업에서 생긴 순소득을 산정할 때 목사로서 서비스를 제공한 대가로 얻은 소득을 포함시켜야 합니다. 이는 크리스천 사이언스 종교인 및 청빈의 서약을 맹세하지 않은 종교 단체에 속한 자들에게도 적용됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 517을 참조하십시오.

양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 사용하면 모든 유형의 소득과 공제 및 세액공제를 신고할 수 있습니다.
#### 전자 신고를 해야하는 이유
#### 전자 신고
조정총소득 (AGI)이 일정 금액 이하일 경우, 무료로 세금 신고서를 작성하고 _e-file(전자 신고)_ 가 가능한, IRS 파트너들이 제공하는 무료 세금 소프트웨어 서비스인 [무료신고(Free File)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)을 이용할 수 있습니다. 소득이 정해진 금액을 초과할 경우, IRS 서면 양식의 전자 버전인 무료 기입 가능 양식(Free File Fillable Form)을 이용할 수 있습니다. [표 1-4](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170485 "표 1-4. 무료로 전자 신고를 하는 방법")는 무료로 전자 방식으로 세금을 신고할 수 있는 방법들을 제시하고 있습니다.
Direct File, Free File, 및 Free Fillable Forms 모두 자격이 있는 납세자들에게 무료로 세금을 전자 신고할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다. [IRS.gov/DirectFile(영어)](https://irs.gov/DirectFile)와 [IRS.gov/FreeFile](https://www.irs.gov/ko/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free)에서 자세한 내용과 귀하의 적격성을 확인하십시오.
.![This is an Image: efile.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/efile.gif)_IRS_ _전자 신고_ _는 자동화를 통해 서면 신고서를 처리하는 데 필요한 수동적 과정을 대체하고 있습니다. 그 결과,__전자 신고_ _된 신고서의 처리는 서면 신고서의 처리보다 속도가 빠르며 정확합니다. 서면 신고서와 마찬가지로 전자 신고 시에도 신고서가 정확한 정보를 담고 있으며 제때 신고되었는지에 대한 책임은 귀하에게 있습니다._.
IRS _전자_ 신고를 통해 신고서를 제춯하면, 신고서가 수취 및 접수되었다는 확인문을 받게 됩니다. 납부해야 할 세금이 있을 경우, _전자 신고_ 를 통해 신고서를 제츌하고 전자 방식으로 세금을 납부할 수 있습니다. IRS는 _전자 신고된_ 신고서를 10억 개 이상 안전하고 확실하게 처리한 바 있습니다. _전자 신고_ 를 이용하여도 신고서에 대해 IRS 감사를 받을 가능성에는 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
**전자 신고서 요구 사항.**
전자 신고서 서명 요건은 세금 소프트웨어를 사용 또는 세무 전문가 이용 여부에 따라 달라집니다. Direct File을 사용하여 전자 신고하는 경우, Direct File이 제공하는 지침에 따라 전자 신고서에 서명해야 합니다. 그외에 전자 신고를 하려면 개인 식별 번호(PIN) 을 사용하여 신고서에 전자적으로 서명하고 아래에 설명된 정보를 제공해야 합니다. 소프트웨어를 사용하여 온라인으로 신고하는 경우 자체 선택 PIN을 사용해야 합니다. 세무 전문가를 통해 전자적으로 신고하는 경우 자가 선택 PIN 또는 세무사 PIN을 사용할 수 있습니다.
IRS로 부터 신원 보호 개인 식별 번호 (IP PIN) (다음에 더 자세히 설명 됨)를 발급 받았다면 모든 여섯자리의 IP PIN이 직업란 옆에 제공된 공간에 기입 되어야만 전자 서명을 완료할 수 있습니다. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우 두명 모두 IP PIN을 발급받았다면 제공된 공간에 두명의 IP PIN을 입력하십시오.
**자체선택 PIN.**
자체선택 PIN 방법을 이용하면 자신만의 PIN을 생성할 수 있습니다. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 귀하와 배우자가 각자 PIN을 생성하여 전자 서명으로서 PIN을 입력해야 합니다.
다섯 자리 연속 0을 제외하고 귀하가 선택한 다섯 가지 숫자의 조합을 통해 PIN을 생성할 수 있습니다. PIN을 사용하면 양식 W-2를 포함하여 서명하거나 우편으로 보낼 서류가 아무것도 없습니다. 
PIN, 성, 생년월일, 해당될 경우 IP PIN 및 2023년 연방 세금신고서의 조정총소득(AGI) 가 포함되어야만 자체선택 PIN으로 서명된 전자신고서가 유효하게 서명된 신고서로 여겨집니다. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 배우자의 PIN, 성, 생년월일, 필요할 경우 IP PIN 및 필요한 경우 AGI 등이 포함되어야만 서명된 신고서로 여겨집니다. (귀하, 그리고 귀하의 배우자가 공동 신고를 했으며 전자 신고를 했다면 각자의 전년도 PIN을 사용해 신원을 증명할 수 있습니다. 전년도 PIN을 사용하거나 IP PIN을 입력한다면 전년도 AGI를 입력하지 않아도 됩니다. 전년도 PIN은 귀하의 2023 신고서를 전자적으로 서명했을때 사용한 다섯자리 PIN입니다.)
원본 2023년 연방 소득세 신고서 사의 AGI가 필요하지만 2023년 소득세 신고서가 없는 경우, [IRS.gov/Account](https://www.irs.gov/ko/payments/online-account-for-individuals)의 온라인 계정을 통해 증명서를 확인할 수 있습니다. 또한 [IRS.gov/Transcript](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/get-transcript) 또는 IRS에 800-908-9946번으로 전화하여 세금 증명서를 무료로 받을 수 있습니다. 수정된 신고서 (양식 1040-X) 또는 IRS에서 작성한 산술적 오류 수정본 상의 AGI를 사용하지 마십시오. AGI는 2023년 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 1에 표시된 금액입니다.

단, 일반적인 기한 (대부분의 납세자에게는 4월 15일)을 넘겨 세금을 납부할 경우, 그 날부터 세금을 납부한 날까지 이자가 부과됩니다.
전투 지역 또는 적격 위험 임무 지역에서 복무한 경우, 신고 기한을 더 길게 연장 받을 자격이 부여될 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_전투 지역에서 복무 중인 개인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170538 "전투 지역 에서 복무 중인 개인")을 참조하여 귀하에게 적용될 수 있는 특별 규칙에 관하여 알아보십시오.
**기혼 납세자.**
공동 신고를 할 경우, 부부 중 한 명만 자동 기한 연장 자격을 갖추면 됩니다. 귀하와 배우자가 개별 신고를 할 경우, 자격을 갖춘 배우자에게만 자동 기한 연장이 적용됩니다. 
**자동 기한 연장을 받는 방법.**
자동 기한 연장을 받기 위해서는 귀하에게 자동 기한 연장 자격을 부여할 수 있는 정황을 설명하는 진술서를 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. (앞서 다룬 (2)의 상황들을 참조하십시오.) 
**2개월 이상 연장.**

**더 이상 연장 불가.**
일반적으로 6개월을 초과한 연장 기간은 주어지지 않습니다. 단, 미국 이외의 국가에 있으며 특정 시험을 통과할 경우, 보다 긴 연장이 주어질 수도 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 54의 _세금 신고 시기 및 납부 기간_ 을 참조하십시오.
#### 전투 지역 에서 복무 중인 개인
전투 지역에 복무하는 경우, 세금 신고, 세금 납부, 및 환급 신청 기한이 자동 연장됩니다. 이는 군인을 비롯한 국방부의 작전 통제 하에 작업하는 상선 상인, 적십자 인력, 공인된 통신 학교 학생, 및 군대 지시에 따라 군인을 지원하는 민간인에게 적용됩니다.
**전투 지역.**
전투 지역은 미국 대통령이 행정 명령을 통해 지정하는 곳으로, 미국 군대가 전투를 벌이고 있는 지역이거나 과거에 전투를 벌인 적이 있는 지역을 가리킵니다. 대통령이 행정 명령으로 지정한 날에 따라 특정 지역이 전투 지역으로 선포되거나 전투 지역으로서 해지됩니다. 자동 기한 연장을 목적으로 했을 때 “전투 지역”이라는 용어는 다음과 같은 지역을 포함하여 가리킵니다. 
  1. 아라비아반도, 1991년 1월 17일 발효.
  2. 코소보 지역, 1999년 3월 24일 발효.
  3. 아프가니스탄 지역, 2001년 9월 19일 발효.


각 전투 지역에 해당하는 위치에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 3을 참조하십시오. 또한 간행물 3을 통해 전투 지역에 복무하는 군인에게 적용되는 기타 세금 혜택에 관한 정보를 확인할 수 있습니다.
**연장 기간.**
세금 신고, 세금 납부, 환급 신청 관련 기한 및 IRS를 상대로 기타 조치를 취하기 위한 기한은 두 단계에 걸쳐 연장됩니다. 먼저, 다음 중 더 뒤에 오는 날로부터 180일 동안 기한이 연장됩니다. 
  1. 귀하가 전투 지역에 머무른 마지막 날 또는 해당 지역이 전투 지역으로서 해지되기 전날, 또는 
  2. 전투 지역 복무 도중 입은 부상으로 인한 [적격 입원](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100012192 "적격 입원.") (뒤에서 정의될 예정) 기간이 지속되는 마지막 날.


두 번째 단계로는 180일 연장에 더하여 전투 지역에 입장할 당시 IRS를 상대로 조치를 취할 수 있었던 남은 일수만큼 기한이 연장됩니다. 예를 들어, 세금 신고를 할 기한이 3½개월 (1월 1일~4월 15일) 남았다고 합시다. 귀하가 전투 지역에 입장한 날 3개월의 기간 중 남은 기간만큼 (또는 1월 1일 전에 입장하였을 경우 3½개월만큼) 180일 연장 기간에 더해집니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 3의 _이 기한 연장은 얼마나 추가 시간을 제공합니까?_ 을 참조하십시오. 
세금 신고 기한 연장에 관한 규칙은 지정된 비상 작전 참여로 인해 (정해진 근무지에서 떨어진) 미국 이외의 국가로 파병된 경우에도 적용됩니다. 
**적격 입원.**
전투 지역 또는 비상 작전 복무로 인한 부상으로 인해 입원한 경우에만 해당됩니다. 적격 입원의 정의는 다음과 같습니다. 
  * 미국 이외의 국가에 입원하거나
  * 미국 내에서 입원 5년 까지. 


적격 입원에 대한 자세한 정보는 간행물 3을 참조하십시오. 
#### 세금 신고서 작성 방법
이 섹션에서는 세금 신고서 작성을 준비하는 방법 및 소득과 지출의 신고 시기에 대해 설명하고 있습니다. 또한 양식의 특정 부분을 작성하는 방법을 설명합니다. [표 1-6](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170544 "표 1-6. 서면 세금 신고서 작성을 위한 여섯 단계")은 세금 신고서를 작성할 때 유용하게 활용됩니다.
#### 표 1-6. 서면 세금 신고서 작성을 위한 여섯 단계
1 | — | 소득 및 비용 기록물을 준비합니다.  
---|---|---  
2 | — | 필요한 양식, 스케줄, 및 간행물을 준비합니다.  
3 | — | 세금 신고서를 작성합니다.  
4 | — | 세금 신고서가 올바르게 작성되었는지 확인합니다.  
5 | — | 세금 신고서에 서명하고 날짜를 기재합니다.  
6 | — | 필요한 양식 및 스케줄을 모두 첨부합니다.  
**전자 신고서.**
전자 신고서를 작성하는 데 도움이 될 만한 정보는 앞서 다룬 [_전자 신고를 해야하는 이유_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170480 "전자 신고를 해야하는 이유")를 참조하십시오.
**대체 세금 양식.**
간행물 1167에서 설명하는 필수 조건을 갖추지 않은 이상 본인이 직접 만든 세금 양식을 사용해서는 안됩니다. 
**양식 W-2.**
귀하가 직원이였을 경우, 귀하의 고용주에게서 양식 W-2를 전달 받아야 합니다. 해당 양식에 기재된 정보는 세금 신고서를 작성할 때 쓰입니다. 4장의 [_2024년 원천징수 및 추정세에 대한 공제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032412 "2024년 원천징수 및 추정세에 대한 세액공제") 아래에 소개된 [_양식 W-2_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032416 "양식 W-2")를 참조하십시오.
고용주는 늦어도 2025년 1월 31일까지 귀하에게 양식 W-2를 전달해야 할 의무가 있습니다. 양식을 우편으로 전달 받는 경우, 고용주에게 연락을 취하기 전에 우편이 도착할 수 있는 충분한 시간을 갖도록 합니다. 2월 초 까지도 전달 받지 못했다면, IRS가 고용주에게 양식을 요청하는 방식으로 도움을 드릴 수 있습니다. IRS의 도움을 요청할 시에는 다음과 같은 정보를 제공할 수 있도록 준비를 해주십시오.
  * 귀하의 이름, 주소 (우편번호 포함), 및 전화번호.
  * 귀하의 SSN.
  * 고용되어 일한 기간.
  * 고용주의 이름, 주소 (우편번호 포함), 및 전화번호.


**양식 1099.**
특정 유형의 소득이 발생한 경우, 양식 1099를 수령하게 될 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어, 10$ 이상의 과세 대상 이자를 수령했다면, 지급인은 늦어도 2025년 1월 31일 (또는 중개인이 양식을 제공하는 경우, 2025년 2월 18일)까지 귀하에게 양식 1099를 제공할 의무가 있습니다. 양식을 우편으로 전달 받는 경우, 지급인에게 연락을 취하기 전에 우편이 도착할 수 있는 충분한 시간을 갖도록 합니다. 2월 18일 (또는 중개인이 양식을 제공하는 경우, 2025년 3월 3일)까지도 양식을 수령하지 못했다면 IRS에 전화를 걸어 도움을 요청하십시오. 
#### 소득 및 비용 신고 시기
과세 대상 소득은 과세 연도를 기준으로 산정해야 합니다. “과세 연도”란 기록물을 보관하고 소득 및 비용을 신고하기 위해 사용되는 연차 회계기간을 가리킵니다. 과세 대상 소득이 명확하게 드러나도록 소득 및 비용을 신고해야 합니다. 이러한 신고 방식을 회계처리 방법이라고 부릅니다. 이 섹션에서는 사용 가능한 회계기간 및 방법을 설명합니다.
#### 회계기간
대부분의 개인 세금 신고서는 1월 1일에서 12월 31일까지의 12개월을 가리키는 일반 연도를 다룹니다. 일반 연도를 사용하지 않는 경우, 귀하의 회계기간은 회계 연도에 해당합니다. 일반적인 회계 연도는 12개월로, 12월을 제외한 달의 마지막 날에 종료됩니다. 52~53주 회계 연도는 52~53주 사이를 오가며, 반드시 일주일 중 같은 날에 종료됩니다.
소득세 신고서를 처음으로 신고할 때 회계기간 (과세 연도)을 결정하게 됩니다. 회계기간은 12개월을 초과할 수 없습니다.
**추가 정보.**
회계기간 변경 방법을 포함한 회계기간에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 538을 참조하십시오.
#### 회계처리 방법
회계처리 방법은 소득 및 비용을 신고하는 방법을 말합니다. 대부분의 납세자들은 현금주의 또는 발생주의 회계처리 방법을 사용합니다. 소득세 신고서를 처음으로 신고할 때 회계처리 방법을 선택하게 됩니다. 그 이후에 회계처리 방법을 변경하고자 할 경우, 일반적으로 반드시 IRS의 승인을 얻어야 합니다. 양식 3115를 사용하여 회계처리 방법의 변경을 요청해야 합니다.
**현금주의 기준 방법.**
이 방법을 사용할 경우, 모든 소득 항목을 실제로 수령하거나 건설적 수령한 연도에 신고하십시오. 일반적으로 모든 비용은 실제로 지급한 연도에 공제합니다. 이는 대부분의 개인 납세자들이 사용하는 방법입니다. 
_**건설적 수령.**_
일반적으로 소득이 계좌에 입금되거나 어떤 방식으로든 귀하가 사용할 수 있도록 마련되었을 때 소득을 건설적으로 수령하였다고 말합니다. 따라서 소득을 물리적으로 보유해야 하는 것은 아닙니다. 예를 들어, 2024년 12월 31일에 귀하의 은행 계좌로 입금된 이자는 (비록 2025년까지 귀하의 기록에 입력되거나 인출된 적이 없어도) 만일 2024년에 인출할 수 있었다면 귀하의 2024년 과세 소득에 해당합니다. 
_**차압된 임금.**_
고용주가 귀하의 부채를 갚기 위해 임금을 사용하거나, 임금이 압류 또는 차압되어도 귀하가 임금 전체를 건설적 수령한 것으로 합니다. 따라서 해당 임금을 수령했어야 하는 연도에 대하여 소득으로 포함시켜야 합니다. 
_**귀하를 대신한 부채 상환.**_
타인이 (증여나 대출이 아닌 방식으로) 귀하의 부채를 탕감하거나 상환할 경우, 귀하는 해당 금액을 건설적 수령한 것으로 하며 일반적으로 해당 연도 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 8장의 [_탕감 부채_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171951 "취소된 부채")를 참조하십시오. 
_**제삼자에게 지급.**_
귀하가 소유한 재산에서 비롯된 소득이 제삼자에게 지급된 경우, 귀하는 해당 소득을 건설적 수령한 것으로 합니다. 귀하가 실제로 소득을 수령한 뒤 제삼자에게 지급한 것과 같게 취급합니다. 
_**대래인에게 지급된 소득.**_
대리인이 귀하를 대신하여 수령한 소득은 대리인이 수령한 해에 귀하가 건설적 수령한 것으로 합니다. 계약서에 귀하의 소득을 타인에게 지급할 것을 명시한 경우, 타인이 소득을 수령한 때를 기준으로 해당 금액을 귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 
_**수령하거나 마련된 수표.**_
연말이 되기 전 귀하가 사용할 수 있도록 마련된 유효한 수표는 해당 연도에 귀하가 건설적 수령한 것으로 합니다. “귀하가 사용할 수 있도록 마련된” 수표에는 이미 수령했으나 현금화하거나 입금하지 않은 수표도 포함됩니다. 예를 들어, 연말 전에 귀하가 가져갈 수 있도록 고용주가 사무실에 준비해둔 마지막 급료지불 수표도 여기에 포함됩니다. 귀하가 연말 전에 해당 수표를 취했는지 여부 또는 연말이 지난 뒤에 우편으로 수령할 수 있도록 기다렸는지 여부와는 관계 없이 귀하가 해당 수표를 건설적 수령한 것으로 합니다. 
_**건설적 수령이 아닌 경우.**_
소득을 건설적 수령하지 않았음을 보여줄 수 있는 경우도 있습니다.
**예시.**
교사인 납세자 레논은 학교 이사회가 제시한 조건에 따라 레는이 자리를 비운 동안에는 본래 수령하는 급여와 학교 이사회가 고용한 임시 교사에게 지급되는 급여의 차액만을 수령하기로 동의하였습니다. 따라서 레논은 임시 교사에게 지급할 급여만큼 차감된 금액을 건설적으로 수령했다고 볼 수 없습니다. 
**발생주의 회계처리 방법.**
발생주의 회계처리 방법을 사용할 경우, 일반적으로 소득을 수령한 시점이 아닌 소득이 발생한 시점을 기준으로 신고합니다. 지출은 일반적으로 지급한 시점이 아닌 지출이 발생한 시점을 기준으로 공제합니다. 
_**선불 소득.**_
선불 소득은 일반적으로 소득을 수령한 해의 총소득에 포함시킵니다. 귀하가 소득을 사용 가능하게 된 이상 회계처리 방법은 중요하지 않습니다. 선불 소득에는 선불 임대료나 이자 및 귀하가 차후에 제공할 서비스를 위해 지급된 금액이 포함될 수 있습니다. 
특정 선불금은 제한적으로 다음 해까지 이연이 허용될 수 있습니다. 구체적인 정보는 간행물 538을 참조하십시오. 
**추가 정보.**
회계처리 방법을 변경하는 방법을 포함한 회계처리 방법에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 538을 참조하십시오.
#### 사회 보장 번호 (SSN)
세금 신고서에 SSN을 기입해야 합니다. 기혼일 경우, 공동 신고 또는 개별 신고와는 관계 없이 귀하와 배우자의 SSN을 모두 기입하십시오.
부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 이름 순서와 동일한 순서대로 SSN을 입력하십시오. IRS에 그외 다른 양식 및 서류를 신고할 때에도 동일한 순서를 유지하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하 또는 배우자가 부부 공동 신고를 하는데 2024년 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함) 또는 그 이전에 발급된 SSN (또는 ITIN)을 보유하지 않은 경우, 2024년 원본 또는 수정된 신고서를 사용하여 특정 세금 혜택을 청구할 수 없습니다._.
발부받은 SSN을 사용하여 세금을 신고하십시오.귀하의 SSN이 취업을 승인하지 않거나 취업을 승인하는 SSN을 발부받았으나 취업 승인을 상실하였더라도 SSN을 사용하여 세금을 신고하십시오. SSN이 발부되었을 경우 ITIN은 귀하에게 발부하지 않을 것입니다. ITIN를 사용하는 도중 SSN을 받았다면 ITIN 사용을 중지하십시오. 대신 SSN을 사용하십시오.
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, W-2, 및 1099에 입력한 이름과 SSN이 사회 보장 카드에 표시된 내용과 일치하는지 확인하십시오. 일치하지 않을 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 통해 청구한 특정 공제가 축소되거나 허용되지 않을 수 있으며, 사회 보장 소득의 적립을 받지 못할 수 있습니다. 양식 W-2에 SSN 또는 이름이 잘못 기재되었다면, 고용주 또는 양식 발급 대변인에게 최대한 빨리 알려 소득이 사회 보장 기록에 적립될 수 있도록 합니다. 사회 보장 카드에 표시된 이름 또는 SSN이 잘못되었을 경우, 사회 보장국 (SSA)에 800-772-1213으로 전화하십시오.
**이름 변경.**
혼인, 이혼 등을 이유로 이름을 변경하였을 경우, 세금을 신고하기 이전에 지역 SSA 사무소에서 변경 사실을 반드시 알리십시오. 세금 신고서 처리 및 환급 지연을 방지할 수 있습니다. 또한 미래에 수령하게 될 사회보장 혜택을 안전하게 보호하는 데에도 도움이 됩니다. 
**부양 가족의 SSN.**
부양 가족의 나이와 상관 없이 귀하가 부양 가족으로 등재한 모든 각 부양 가족의 SSN을 제공해야 합니다. 이러한 요건은 귀하가 세금 신고서에서 부양 가족으로 등재한 (자녀만이 아닌) 모든 부양 가족에 대하여 적용됩니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_해당 자녀에 대하여 2024년 원본 또는 수정된 신고서에 세금 혜택을 청구할 적격 대상에 해당하기 위해서는 적격 자녀가 2024년 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함) 내에 발급된, 취업 시 유효한 SSN을 보유하고 있어야 합니다._[14장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000174526 "자녀 세액공제 및 기타 부양가족에 대한 세액공제") _을 참조하십시오._.
_**예외.**_
자녀가 2024년에 출생 및 사망하였으며 SSN을 보유하지 않았다면, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR _부양 가족_ 섹션의 (2) 열에 “DIED” (사망)라고 입력하고 자녀의 출생 증명서, 사망 증명서 및 병원 기록 사본을 첨부하십시오. 자녀가 살아서 출생한 사실이 서류를 통해 증명되어야 합니다.
**SSN을 보유하지 않은 경우.**
양식 SS-5, ‘사회 보장 카드 신청서’를 지역 SSA 사무소에 제출하여 귀하 또는 부양 가족의 SSN을 신청하십시오. SSN 발급에는 약 2주가 소요됩니다. 귀하 또는 부양 가족에게 SSN 신청 자격이 없는 경우, 뒤에서 다룰 [_개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170577 "개인 납세자 식별 번호 \(ITIN\).")를 참조하십시오.
미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인의 경우, 양식 SS-5를 사용하여 귀하의 나이, 신원, 시민권 또는 외국인 신분을 증명해야 합니다. 만 12세 이상이며 SSN을 발급 받은 적이 없는 경우, 이러한 사실 관계를 증명하는 서류를 지참하여 SSA 사무소를 직접 방문해야 합니다. 
SSA 사무소 어디에서든 양식 SS-5를 제공 받을 수 있으며, [SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)를 방문하거나 800-772-1213으로 전화를 걸어 제공 받을 수도 있습니다. 나이, 신원, 또는 시민권을 증명하는 데 사용할 수 있는 서류에 관하여 문의 사항이 있을 경우, SSA 사무소에 연락을 취하십시오.
세금 신고 기한 내에 부양 가족이 SSN을 보유하지 못하는 경우, 앞서 [_세금 신고 시기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170505 "세금 신고 시기")에서 설명한 바와 같이 신고 기한 연장을 신청하는 것이 유용할 수 있습니다.
필수적으로 제공해야 할 SSN을 제공하지 못하거나 부정확한 SSN을 제공할 경우, 세금이 증가할 수 있으며 환급액이 축소될 수 있습니다.
**입양 납세자 식별 번호 (ATIN).**
미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인인 자녀를 입양하는 과정을 진행하고 있어, 입양 절차가 완료되기 전에 자녀의 SSN을 발급 받을 수 없는 경우, SSN을 대신하여 사용할 수 있는 ATIN 발급을 신청할 수 있습니다. 
다음 사항에 모두 해당할 경우, IRS에 양식 W-7A, 입양 수속 중의 납세자 식별 번호 신청서를 신고하여 ATIN을 발급 받으십시오. 
  * 법적 입양을 위해 귀하 가정에 위탁된, 함께 사는 자녀가 있을 경우.
  * 자녀의 친부모, 입양 기관 및 그외의 관계자들로부터 자녀가 기존에 보유한 SSN을 얻기 위해 합당한 노력을 기울였으나, 자녀의 SSN을 얻지 못햇을 경우.
  * 예를 들어, 입양 절차가 완료되지 않았기 때문에 SSA에 자녀의 SSN을 신청할 수 없었을 경우.
  * 세금 신고서에 자녀를 부양 가족으로 등재할 자격이 있을 경우.


입양 절차가 완료된 후에는, 자녀의 SSN을 반드시 신청해야 합니다. 계속해서 ATIN을 사용할 수는 없습니다.
자세한 정보는 양식 W-7A를 참조하십시오. 
**비거주외국인 배우자.**
배우자가 비거주 외국인이며 다음에 해당할 경우, 배우자가 SSN 또는 ITIN 중 하나를 보유해야 합니다.
  * 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 또는
  * 배우자가 개별 신고를 할 경우.


배우자에게 SSN 신청 자격이 없을 경우, [ITIN에 관한 이어지는 논의](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170577 "개인 납세자 식별 번호 \(ITIN\).")를 참조하십시오.
**개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN).**
비거주 또는 거주 외국인이며 SSN을 보유하지 않고 SSN 신청 자격이 없는 경우, IRS에서 ITIN을 발급합니다. 이와 같은 사항은 외국인의 배우자 또는 부양 가족에게도 적용됩니다. IRS에 양식 W-7을 제출하여 ITIN 발급을 신청하십시오. ITIN 발급에는 약 7주가 소요됩니다. 세금 신고서에 SSN을 기입해야 하는 모든 경우에 대하여 ITIN을 기입하십시오.
ITIN이 만료되지 않게 주의하십시오. 이전의 [_개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN) 갱신_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100071010 "개인 납세자 식별 번호 \(ITIN\) 갱신.")에서 ITIN의 만료 및 갱신에 대한 더 많은 정보를 보십시오. 또한 추가적인 정보는 [IRS.gov/ITIN](https://www.irs.gov/ko/tin/itin/individual-taxpayer-identification-number-itin)에서 확인할 수 있습니다.

_**ITIN은 세금을 위한 용도로만 사용.**_
ITIN은 연방 세금 용도로만 사용할 수 있습니다. ITIN에 의해 사회보장 혜택을 받을 권리가 부여되지 않으며, 미국법 하의 고용 또는 이민 신원이 변경되지 않습니다. 
**사회 보장 번호를 제공하지 않은 것에 따른 과징금.**
SSN 제공이 필수적인 사안에 대해 귀하, 배우자, 또는 부양 가족의 SSN을 제공하지 않을 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170711 "과징금")에 관한 논의를 참조하십시오.

세금 계정과 관련하여 IRS에 서신을 보낼 경우, 귀하의 SSN (부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 배우자의 이름과 SSN)을 서신에 포함시켜주십시오. 귀하의 계정을 확인하는 데 SSN이 사용되기 때문에 SSN 제공 시 IRS로부터 빠른 회신을 받는 데 도움이 됩니다.
#### 대통령 선거 캠페인 기금
이 기금은 대통령 선거 캠페인 자금을 조달하는데 쓰입니다. 또한 소아과 의학 연구 자금으로도 쓰입니다. $3를 해당 기금에 기부하고자 할 경우, 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하십시오. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 배우자 역시 $3를 해당 기금에 기부할 수 있습니다. 빈칸에 체크 표시를 할 경우, 귀하의 세금 및 환급에는 영향을 주지 않습니다.
#### 계산
다음에 제시된 정보를 참고할 경우, 세금 신고서를 보다 쉽게 작성하는 데 도움을 얻을 수 있습니다.
**달러로 반올림.**
세금 신고서 및 스케줄 작성 시 센트를 달러로 반올림할 수 있습니다. 달러로 반올림할 경우, 모든 금액을 반올림해야 합니다. 반올림 시, 50 센트 미만인 금액은 내림하고 50~99센트는 달러로 올림하십시오. 예를 들어, $1.39는 $1가 되며, $2.50는 $3가 됩니다.
양식 및 스케줄의 줄에 입력할 금액을 여러 개 합산해야 할 경우, 합산 시에는 반올림을 하지 말고 합산한 총액만 반올림하십시오. 
센트를 포함한 금액을 입력할 경우, 소수점을 반드시 포함시키십시오. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에는 센트 열이 제공되지 않습니다.
**동일한 금액.**
동일한 금액 중 더 적거나 많은 금액을 입력할 것을 요구하는 경우, 해당 금액을 입력하십시오.
**음수 금액.**
세금 신고서를 서면으로 신고할 때 음수 금액을 입력해야 할 경우, 음수 부호를 사용하는 대신 해당 금액을 괄호 안에 넣으십시오. 양수와 음수 금액을 합산해야 할 경우, 양수 금액을 모두 합산한 금액에서 음수 금액을 빼주십시오.
#### 첨부
귀하가 신고한 양식 및 세금 신고서에 신고한 항목에 따라 추가 스케줄 및 양식을 작성하고 서면 신고서에 첨부해야 할 수도 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_IRS 전자 신고를 이용하여 서면 첨부 사항이 없는 신고서를 제출할 수도 있습니다. 해당 방식을 이용하면 양식 W-2를 포함하여 첨부하거나 우편 발송할 서류가 발생하지 않습니다. 앞서 다룬_[전자 방식 제출의 장점](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170480 "전자 신고를 해야하는 이유") _을 참조하십시오._.
**양식 W-2.**
양식 W-2는 귀하에게 지급된 임금을 비롯한 기타 보상 및 임금에서 원천징수된 세금에 관하여 고용주가 제공하는 내역서입니다. 양식 W-2는 각각 고용주에게서 받아야 합니다. 서면 신고서 제출 시 세금 신고서에 표시된 부분에 양식 W-2를 첨부하십시오. 자세한 정보는 4장의 [_양식 W-2_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032416 "양식 W-2")를 참조하십시오.
**양식 1099-R.**
연방 소득세 원천징수가 표시된 양식 1099-R을 수령하고 서면 신고서를 제출한 경우, 신고서에 표시된 부분에 해당 양식의 사본을 첨부하십시오.
**양식 1040 또는 1040-SR.**
서면 신고서를 신고할 경우, 양식 또는 스케줄의 우측 상단에 표시된 “Attachment Sequence No” (첨부 순서 번호)에 따라 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 뒷면에 양식 또는 스케줄을 첨부하십시오. 그 다음에는 기타 내역서 및 첨부물을 관련 양식 및 스케줄 첨부 순서와 동일한 순서로 마지막에 첨부하십시오. 요구 사항이 아닌 이상 첨부물을 첨부하지 마십시오.
#### 제삼자 지정인
귀하의 친구, 가족, 또는 기타 지정인이 귀하의 2024년 세금 신고서에 대해 IRS와 논의할 수 있기를 원한다면 “Third Party Designee” (제삼자 지정인)영역의 “Yes” (네) 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하면 됩니다. 지정인의 이름, 전화번호 및 지정인이 자신의 개인 식별 번호 (PIN)로 지정한 다섯 자리 숫자를 입력하십시오.
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 부부 공동 신고서에서 “Yes” (네) 빈칸에 체크 표시를 할 경우 IRS가 세금 신고서 처리 과정에서 문의 사항이 있을 시, 지정인에게 연락을 취하여 해당 내용을 문의해도 된다는 허가를 하는 것 입니다. 지정인은 다음과 같은 행동을 취할 수 있습니다:
  * IRS에 세금 신고서상 누락된 정보 제공,
  * IRS에 세금 신고서의 처리 및 환급 또는 지급금 상태에 관한 정보 요청,
  * 귀하의 세금 신고서 관련 안내문 또는 증명서 요청 및 수령,
  * 계산 오류, 상계 (뒤에서 다룰 [_환급_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170612 "환급") 참조), 및 세금 신고서 작성에 관한 특정 IRS 고지서에 대한 응답.


단, 지정인이 환급 수표를 수령하거나 (추가 채납 세금을 비롯한) 사안에 대하여 귀하에게 구속력을 갖거나 IRS를 상대로 귀하를 대변할 권한을 부여하는 것은 아닙니다. 지정인의 권한을 확장하고자 할 경우, 간행물 947을 참조하십시오.
이러한 권한 부여는 2025년 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 제외)이 도래하기 전에 자동으로 만료됩니다. 대부분의 납세자들에게 이는 2026년 4월 15일을 의미합니다.
자세한 정보는 귀하의 양식의 지침을 참조하십시오.
#### 서명
세금 신고서에 반드시 서명을 하고 날짜를 입력해야 합니다. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 부부 중 한 명에게만 소득이 발생하였어도 귀하와 배우자 모두 반드시 신고서에 서명을 해야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 일반적으로 양쪽 배우자 모두에게 세금에 대한 책임이 있으며, 한쪽 배우자를 상대로 세금 전체에 대한 책임을 부과할 수 있습니다._[2장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170734 "납세자 구분") _을 참조하십시오._.
신고서의 지침에 나와있는 요구사항에 따라서 세금 신고서에 서명이 되어 있기 전까진 귀하의 세금 신고서는 유효하지 않다고 간주됩니다.
서면 세금 신고서를 제출 할 경우 반드시 자필로 서명을 해야 합니다. 디지털, 전자식, 또는 타자기 글자로 된 서명은 서면으로 신고 된 양식 1040 또는 1040–SR의 유효한 서명이 아닙니다.
전자 세금을 신고 할 경우 신고서 지침에 나와있는 요구사항을 따른 전자식 서명을 사용할 수 있습니다.
위의 요구사항을 따르지 못한 서명을 신고서에 할 경우 세금 환급을 받지 못할 수도 있습니다.
직업을 입력하십시오. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 귀하와 배우자의 직업을 모두 입력하십시오.
**대리 서명을 할 수 있는 경우.**
다음에 해당하는 경우, 대변인을 지명하여 세금 신고서에 대신 서명하도록 할 수 있습니다. 
  1. 질병 또는 부상으로 인해 세금 신고서에 서명할 수 없는 경우,
  2. 적어도 세금 신고 기한 60일 전부터 지속된 기간 동안 미국에 없는 경우, 또는
  3. 귀하가 사는 지역에 위치한 IRS 사무소의 허가를 받은 경우.


_**위임장.**_
이러한 경우에 해당하여 대변인이 세금 신고서에 대신 서명을 하였을 경우, 대변인이 귀하를 대신하여 서명할 수 있는 권한을 부여하는 위임장 (POA)을 첨부해야 합니다. 대변인이 세금 신고서에 대신 서명할 권한을 부여함을 명시한 POA를 사용하거나 양식 2848을 사용하십시오. 양식 2848의 파트 I에는 대변인이 세금 신고서에 대신 서명할 권한을 부여 받은 사실이 명시되어야 합니다. 
**법원 지정 관리인, 보호자, 또는 기타 수탁자.**
귀하가 세금 신고를 해야 하는 지적 장애인 또는 신체 장애인의 법원이 지정한 관리인, 보호자, 또는 기타 수탁자일 경우, 해당 납세자를 대신하여 귀하의 서명을 입력하십시오. 양식 56을 제출하십시오.
_**서명 불가.**_
납세자가 지적 능력은 갖추었지만 세금 신고서 또는 위임장에 서명할 신체 능력을 갖추지 못하였을 경우, 주법에 따라 유효한 “signature” (서명)이 정의됩니다. 이는 납세자가 서명하고자 하는 의사를 명확히 나타내는 표시라면 무엇이든 인정될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 납세자가 표시한 “X” 표시에 목격자 두 명이 서명한 것도 주법에 따라 유효한 서명으로 간주될 수 있습니다. 
**배우자가 서명 불가 .**
귀하의 배우자가 어떠한 이유로 인해 세금 신고서에 서명을 할 수 없는 경우, 2장의 [_부부 공동 신고_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170769 "공동 신고서에 서명하기.")를 참조하십시오.
**자녀의 세금 신고서.**
자녀가 세금을 신고해야 하는데 신고서에 서명을 하지 못하는 경우, 자녀의 부모, 보호자, 또는 기타 법적 책임이 있는 자가 자녀의 이름으로 서명을 한 뒤 “By (귀하의 서명), parent for minor child” (미성년자의 부모로써)라는 문구를 덧붙여야 합니다. 
#### 유료 세무 대리인
일반적으로 세금 신고서를 대신 작성하거나 작성에 도움을 주거나 또는 검토하도록 귀하가 고용한 인물은 신고서에 서명을 하고 세금 신고서의 유료 세무 대리인 영역에 표시된 빈칸에 유료 세무 대리인 세금 식별 번호 (PTIN)를 포함한 입력 사항을 기입해야 합니다.
세금 신고서 작성 시 많은 세무 대리인들에게는 _전자 신고_ 를 하도록 요구되고 있습니다. 이들은 세금 신고서 작성 소프트웨어를 사용하여 _전자 신고_ 신고서에 서명을 합니다. 단, 원할 경우 서면으로 세금 신고서를 작성하도록 할 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우, 유료 세무 대리인은 서면 신고서에 자필로 서명하거나 고무 도장 또는 기계 장치를 사용할 수 있습니다. 유료 세무 대리인에게는 세금 신고서에 서명을 부착할 직접적 책임이 있습니다.
(세금 신고서 작성을 위해 개인 또는 사업체에 고용되지 않은) 자영업자인 세무 대리인의 경우, 세금 신고서의 “Paid Preparer Use Only” (오직 유료 세무 대리인용)영역에 표시된 자영업자 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하십시오.
세무 대리인은 IRS에 신고한 사본과 함께 반드시 귀하에게 세금 신고서 사본을 제공해야 합니다.
귀하가 직접 세금 신고서를 작성할 경우, 이 영역을 빈칸으로 두십시오. 타인이 귀하의 세금 신고서를 대신 작성해주는 대가로 아무런 보수를 받지 않은 경우, 타인의 서명을 신고서에 포함시키지 마십시오.
세무 대리인이 귀하의 세금 신고서에 반드시 서명을 해야 하는지 여부에 관하여 문의 사항이 있을 경우, IRS 사무소 어디에든 연락을 취하십시오.
#### 환급
세금 신고서 작성 시 납부해야 할 소득세보다 많은 금액을 납부하지 않았는지 알아볼 수 있습니다. 과다 납부한 경우, 해당 금액을 환급 받거나 다음 연도 (2025년) 추정세에 해당 금액의 전부 또는 일부를 적용하도록 선택할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_2024년 과도 납부액을 2025년 추정세로 적용하도록 선택할 경우, 2024년 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 제외)이 지난 시점에서는 마음을 바꾸고 환급을 받을 수 없습니다._.
양식 1040의 지침에 따라 입력 사항을 모두 입력하여 환급 신청 및/또는 2025년 추정세에 과도 납부액 적용을 진행하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2024년에 대한 환급액이 클 경우, 2025년에 임금에서 원천징수되는 소득세를 축소하는 것이 좋습니다. 자세한 정보는_[4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세") _을 참조하십시오._.
.![This is an Image: deposit.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/deposit.gif)_종이 수표를 수령하는 대신 개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA)을 포함한 은행, 저축, 의료 저축, 중개 또는 기타 유사한 계좌로 환급금을 직접 입금 받을 수도 있습니다. 양식 1040의 지침에 따라 직접 입금을 신청하십시오. 직접 입금이 불가능할 경우, IRS가 대신 수표를 보내드립니다._.
귀하 명의가 아닌 계좌로 환급금 전부 또는 일부의 직접 입금을 요청하지 마십시오. 세무 대리인이 자신의 계좌로 환급액 전부 또는 일부를 입금 받지 못하도록 하십시오. 단일 계좌 또는 선불 직불 카드로 직접 입금 받을 수 있는 횟수는 1 년에 3회 환급으로 제한되어 있습니다. 제한 횟수를 넘어갈 경우, 종이 수표를 보내드립니다. [IRS.gov/DirectDepositLimits(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Direct-Deposit-Limits)를 방문하여 자세한 내용을 알아보십시오.
**IRA.**
환급액 (또는 그 일부)을 전통 IRA 또는 Roth IRA 로는 직접 입금이 가능하지만, SIMPLE IRA로는 가능하지 않습니다. IRA를 먼저 은행 또는 금융 기관에 제정해야 직접 입금을 요청할 수 있습니다.
**분할 환급.**
직접 입금을 선택할 경우, 환급액을 분할하여 2개 이상의 계좌에 입급할 수 있습니다. 양식 8888을 작성하고 귀하의 신고서에 첨부하십시오.
**$1 미만의 과다 납부액.**
과다 납부된 세액이 $1 미만일 경우, 서면으로 환급을 요청하지 않는 이상 해당 금액을 환급 받을 수 없습니다. 
**환급 수표의 현금화.**
세금 환급 수표를 수령하였을 경우, 빠른 시일 내에 현금화하십시오. 수표 만료일은 발행일로부터 12번째 돌아오는 달의 마지막 사업일입니다. 
수표가 만료되었을 경우, IRS에 재발급을 요청할 수 있습니다. 
**예상보다 많거나 적은 환급금.**
받을 자격이 없는 환급액에 대한 수표를 수령하였거나 추정세로 이전되었어야 할 과도 환급금을 수령한 경우, 수표를 현금과하지 마십시오. IRS에 연락하십시오.
귀하가 청구한 환급금보다 많은 금액의 수표를 수령한 경우, 금액 차이를 설명하는 안내문을 수령하기 전에는 수표를 현금화하지 마십시오.
귀하가 청구한 환급금보다 적은 금액의 수표를 수령한 경우, 금액 차이를 설명하는 안내문도 함께 전달 받았어야 합니다. 수표를 현금화하였어도 추가 환급금을 청구할 수 있습니다.
안내문을 수령하지 않았으며 환급액에 대한 문의 사항이 있을 경우, 2주간 기다리십시오. 그래도 안내문을 전달 받지 못했다면, IRS에 전화로 연락하십시오.
**부채 상계.**
환급이 예정되어 있는데 미납 세금이 있을 경우, 환급금의 전부 또는 일부가 체납액의 전부 또는 일부를 지불하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다. 여기에는 체납 연방 소득세, (학자금 대출과 같은) 기타 연방 부채, 주 소득세, 자녀 양육 보조비, 배우자 생활 보조금, 및 주 실업 수당 채무가 포함됩니다. 귀하가 청구한 환급금이 부채를 상계 시키는데 사용된 경우, 이를 귀하에게 통보해드립니다. 
_**부부 공동 신고서와 피해 배우자.**_
부부 공동 신고를 하는데 배우자 한쪽에게만 체납액이 있을 경우, 다른 배우자를 피해 배우자로 간주할 수 있습니다. 다음 두 가지 모두 해당하며 피해 배우자가 부부 공동 신고서에 명시된 과도 납부액 중 자신의 몫을 환급 받고자 할 경우, 피해 배우자는 양식 8379, 피해 배우자의 할당을 제출하십시오. 
  1. 체납액을 납부할 법적 책임이 없을 경우.
  2. (임금에서 원천징수된 연방 소득세 또는 추정세 지불과 같은) 세금을 납부하고 신고하였거나 환급가능 세액공제 (앞서 다룬 [_세금 신고 대상_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170439 "세금 신고 대상자") 참조)를 청구했을 경우.


### 참고.
피해 배우자의 거주지가 해당 과세 연도 기간 동안 공동 재산을 인정하는 주에 위치한 적이 있을 경우, 특별 규칙이 적용될 수 있습니다. 양식 8379의 지침을 참조하십시오. 
부부 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않았으며 부부 공동 환급금이 상계될 것임을 알고 있을 경우, 세금 신고서와 함께 양식 8379를 제출하십시오. 세금 신고서를 서면으로 제출한 날로부터 14주 이내 또는 전자 방식으로 신고한 날로부터 11주 이내에 환급금을 수령할 수 있습니다. 
부부 공동 신고서를 제출하였으며 부부 공동 환급금이 상계되었을 경우, 양식 8379를 단독으로 제출하십시오. 환급금이 상계된 이후 양식을 신고할 경우, 환급금을 수령하는 데 최대 8주가 소요될 수 있습니다. 이전에 신고한 세금 신고서를 첨부하지 십시오. 단, 양쪽 배우자 모두에게 해당하는 양식 W-2 및 W-2G 사본을 포함시키고 원천징수된 소득세가 명시된 양식 1099가 있을 경우 이 또한 포함시키십시오. 이와 같은 양식이 첨부되지 않았거나 양식을 완성하지 않은 채로 제출하였을 경우, 양식 8379의 처리가 지연될 수 있습니다. 
각 과세 연도에 대해 양식 8379를 따로 신고해야 과세 연도 각각에 대해 처리가 가능합니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_피해 배우자 청구는 무고한 배우자에 대한 구제 요청과는 다른 것입니다. 피해 배우자는 양식 8379를 사용하여 배우자 각자에게 부여된 세금 과도 납부금 부분을 요청할 수 있습니다. 무고한 배우자는 양식 8857, 무고한 배우자에 대한 구제를 사용하여 부부 공동 신고서에 잘못 신고된, 상대 배우자 (또는 전 배우자)에게 해당하는 항목에 따른 부부 공동 채무 세금, 이자 및 과징금 면제를 요청할 수 있습니다. 무고한 배우자에 대한 정보는 2장, 부부 공동 신고 하의_[공동 책임 면제](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170768 "공동 책임에 대한 면제.") _를 참조하십시오._.
#### 미납 세액
세금 신고서 작성 시 미납 세액 전체를 납부했는지 알아볼 수 있습니다. 추가 세금을 납부해야 할 경우, 세금을 신고할 때 함께 납부하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_미납 세액이 $1 미만일 경우, 납부하지 않아도 됩니다._.
IRS에서 귀하의 세금을 산정할 경우, 미납 세액에 대한 고지서를 받게 됩니다. 고지서를 받은 후 30일 이내 (더 늦어질 경우, 세금 신고 기한 내)에 세금을 납부하십시오. 13장의 [_IRS가 산정한 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000174225 "IRS가 산정한 세금")을 참조하십시오.

.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2024년에 대한 미납 세액이 클 경우, 임금에서 원천징수되는 금액을 늘리거나 2025년 추정세를 예납하는 것이 좋습니다. 자세한 정보는_[4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세") _을 참조하십시오._.
#### 납부 방법
온라인, 전화, 모바일 기기, 현금, 또는 수표 및 우편환을 사용한 납부 모두 가능합니다. 2025년에 대한 추정세 예납은 여기에 포함시키지 마십시오. 추정세는 따로 납부해주십시오.
**부도 수표 또는 납부금.**
부도 수표를 사용한 IRS 납부에 따른 과징금은 $25 또는 수표액의 2% 중 더 높은 금액으로 산정됩니다. IRS가 돈을 받지 못한 경우, 다른 납부 형태에도 이러한 과징금이 적용됩니다.
**온라인 납부.**
온라인 납부는 편리하고 안전하며 귀하의 세금을 IRS가 제때 수령하는 데 도움을 줍니다.
온라인으로 납부하는 방법에는 IRS 직접 입금을 통해 은행 계좌에서 직접 이전하거나 전자식 연방 세금 납부 시스템 (EFTPS)을 이용하거나 직불 카드 또는 신용 카드를 사용하는 방법이 있습니다.
[IRS.gov/Payments](https://www.irs.gov/ko/payments)를 방문하여 온라인으로 세금을 납부하거나 이와 관련한 자세한 정보를 알아보십시오.
**전화로 납부.**
전화 납부는 또 하나의 온라인 납부 방식으로, 편리하고 안전합니다. 다음 중 한 가지 방식을 사용해주십시오.

[IRS.gov/Payments](https://www.irs.gov/Payments)를 방문하면 전화 납부에 관한 최신 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.
**현금 납부.**
현금으로 세금을 납부할 수 있습니다. 다른 종류의 현금 납부에 대해 알아보려면 [IRS.gov/PayCash(영어)](https://irs.gov/PayCash)을 방문하십시오. 우편으로 현금을 보내지 마십시오.
**수표 또는 우편환을 사용한 납부.**
수표 또는 우편환의 지불 수취인 대상을 “United States Treasury” (미국 재무부)로 기재하여 미납 세액 전체를 납부해주십시오. 현금을 보내지 마십시오. 납부금을 세금 신고서에 첨부하지 마십시오. 수표 또는 우편환의 앞면에 귀하의 정확한 이름, SSN, 낮 시간 사용 전화번호, 과세 연도, 및 양식 번호를 기재하십시오. 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 세금 신고서에 먼저 입력된 SSN을 먼저 입력하십시오.
_**수표를 사용하여 납부하는 납세자들을 위한 안내.**_
수표를 사용하여 납부할 경우, 귀하는 IRS가 수표에 입력된 정보를 사용하여 귀하의 계좌에서 전자 방식의 일회성 자금 이전을 하거나 해당 납부를 수표 거래로 처리할 권한을 부여하는 것입니다. IRS에서 귀하의 수표에 입력된 정보를 사용하여 전자 방식의 자금 이전을 수행할 경우, 빠르면 수표 수령 당일에 자금 이체가 이루어질 수 있으며, 귀하는 금융 기관으로부터 수표를 돌려 받을 수 없습니다.
_**$1억 이상 수표는 취급하지 않습니다.**_
IRS는 한 장에 $100,000,000 ($1억) 이상인 수표 (자기앞수표 포함)는 취급하지 않습니다. 수표를 통해 $1억 이상을 전달하고자 하는 경우, 각각 $1억 미만인 수표 두 장 이상에 나누어 지급해야 합니다. 이 제한 금액은 (전자 방식 납부와 같은) 다른 납부 방식에는 적용되지 않습니다. 납부할 금액이 $1억을 넘어갈 경우, 수표가 아닌 다른 납부 방식을 고려해주십시오.
**추정세 예납.**
2024년 소득세 신고서에 대한 세금을 납부할 때 2025년 추정세는 포함시키지 마십시오. 추정세 예납 방법에 관한 자세한 정보는 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세")을 참조하십시오.
#### 이자
세금 신고 기한 내에 납부하지 않은 세금에 대하여 이자가 부과됩니다. 신고 기한 연장을 받는다 하여도 이자는 부과됩니다.

미신고 과징금, 정확도 관련 과징금 및 사기 과징금에 대하여 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함)부터 납부일까지 이자가 부과됩니다. 다른 과징금에 대한 이자는 안내문 및 납부 요청서 날짜부터 부과되지만, 안내문 날짜로부터 달력일 기준 21일 이내 (또는 $100,000 이상의 과징금에 대한 안내문의 경우, 사업일 10일 이내)에 납부한 과징금에 대해서는 부과되지 않습니다. 
**IRS의 오류 또는 지연으로 인한 이자.**
불합리한 오류나 IRS 사무관 또는 직원이 행정 또는 경영상 조치를 수행하는 중에 지연이 발생하여 이자가 부과된 경우, 이자의 전부 또는 일부를 면제 받을 수 있습니다. 
행정상 조치는 귀하의 사안을 처리하는 데 수행하는 절차적 행위 또는 기계적 행위를 가리킵니다. 경영상 조치에는 인력 이동 및 장기 연수가 포함됩니다. 연방세법의 적합한 적용에 관한 결정은 행정 또는 경영상 조치에 해당하지 않습니다. 
오류 또는 지연의 중요한 책임이 귀하에게 있지 않으며 IRS에서 결함 또는 납부에 관하여 귀학에게 서면으로 통지하였을 경우에만 이자가 면제됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 556을 참조하십시오. 
신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함) 내에 세금을 신고하였으며 다음 중 더 뒤에 오는 날짜로부터 36개월 이내에 IRS에서 귀하의 채무 및 그 근거를 구체적으로 명시한 안내문을 제공하지 않았을 경우, 이자 및 과징금 부과가 일정 기간 정지될 수 있습니다.

#### 분납 합의
세금 신고 시 미납 세액 전부를 완납할 수 없을 경우, 세액의 전부 또는 일부에 대하여 월부 분납 합의를 요청할 수 있습니다. 단, 분납 신청이 승인되더라도 귀하의 세금 신고 기한 내에 납부하지 않은 세금에 대해서는 이자가 부과되며 연체 납부에 대한 과징금도 부과될 수 있습니다. 분납 신청이 승인될 경우, 수수료를 납부해야 합니다. 이자 및 과징금 부과를 줄이기 위해서는 세금 신고 시 세금을 최대한 많이 납부하십시오. 분납 합의를 신청하기 전에 은행 대출 또는 신용 카드 납부와 같은 보다 저렴한 대체안을 고려해 보십시오. 
온라인으로 분납 합의 신청을 하고자 할 경우, [IRS.gov/OPA](https://www.irs.gov/ko/payments/online-payment-agreement-application)를 방문해주십시오. 또한 양식 9465를 사용할 수도 있습니다.

#### 환급에 대한 이자
환급이 예정된 경우, 그에 대한 이자가 지급될 수도 있습니다. 이자율은 분기별로 조정됩니다.
환급 예정일로부터 45일 이내에 환급이 이루어질 경우, 이자가 지급되지 않습니다. 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함)이 지난 뒤에 세금 신고 시 신고일로부터 45일 이내에 환급이 이루어질 경우, 이자가 지급되지 않습니다. 45일 기한 내에 환급이 이루어지지 않을 경우, 세금 신고 기한일 또는 귀하의 세금 신고일 중 더 나중에 도래한 날부터 이자가 지급됩니다. 
환급 수표를 수용하여도 추가 환급 또는 이자를 청구할 수 있는 귀하의 권리에는 변함이 없습니다. 해당되는 기한 내에 청구 사항을 신고하십시오. 뒤에서 다룰 [_수정된 신고서 및 환급 청구_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170688 "수정된 신고서 및 환급 청구")를 참조하십시오. 환급 수표를 수용하지 않을 경우, 수표에 포함된 과도 지불액에 대해서는 이자가 지급되지 않습니다.
**환급 오류에 대한 이자.**
환급 오류에 대해 부과된 이자의 경우, 일반적으로 그 전부 또는 일부가 면제됩니다. 다음 중 하나에 해당하지 않을 경우, 상환 요청이 이루어지기 전 경과한 기간에 대하여 부과된 이자는 면제됩니다. 
  1. 귀하 또는 귀하와 관련된 사람이 환급 오류의 원인을 제공하였을 경우.
  2. 환급액이 $50,000를 초과한 경우.


예를 들어, 귀하가 세금 신고서에 $100를 환급으로 청구하였는데, IRS가 오류를 범하여 $1,000를 지급한 경우, $900의 차액을 보유한 기간에 대하여 이자가 부과되지 않습니다. 단, IRS의 요구가 있는 즉시 $900를 상환해야 합니다.
#### 주소 변경
주소를 변경한 경우, 새로운 주소를 사용하여 세금을 신고하십시오.
세금을 신고한 후 주소를 변경한 경우, 주소 변경에 관하여 IRS에 명확하고 간결하게 알리도록 합니다. 서면, 전자 방식, 또는 구두로도 가능합니다. 귀하의 구 주소지 구역을 관활하는 IRS 센터로 서면 통지문을 보내주십시오. 양식 8822, ‘주소 변경’을 사용하면 됩니다. 환급이 예정된 경우, 귀하의 구 주소지 구역을 관활하는 우체국에도 주소 변경 사실을 알리십시오. (환급액을 직접 입금으로 수령하지 않는 한) 이를 통해 새 주소로 수표를 전달 받을 수 있을 것입니다. 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov/irb/2010-19_IRB/ar07.html(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2010-19_IRB/ar07.html)의 세무 절차 2010-16, 2010-19 I.R.B. 664를 참조하십시오.
IRS와 서신을 주고 받을 때에는 귀하의 SSN(부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 배우자의 이름과 SSN도 포함)을 반드시 포함시키십시오.
#### 오류를 범한 경우
오류가 있는 경우, 환급이 지연되거나 귀하에게 안내문이 발송될 수 있습니다. 오류를 발견한 경우, 수정된 신고서를 신고하거나 환급을 청구하십시오.
#### 수정된 신고서 및 환급 청구
세금을 신고한 뒤 다음과 같은 오류를 발견한 경우, 세금 신고서를 수정해야 합니다.
  1. 소득의 일부를 신고하지 않았을 경우.
  2. 청구해서는 안될 공제를 청구하였을 경우.
  3. 청구할 수 있었던 공제를 청구하지 않았을 경우.
  4. 납세자 구분을 잘못 선택하였다. 부부 공동 신고를 한 경우, 세금 신고 기한이 지난 뒤 해당 연도에 대해 부부 개별 세금 신고를 할 수 없습니다. 단, 사망한 배우자에 대해서는 집행인이 이러한 변경을 가할 수도 있습니다.)


귀하의 세금 신고서 사본이 필요한 경우, 앞서 다룬 _보관해야 하는 기록물의 종류_ 에서 [_세금 신고서 사본_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000264673 "세금 신고서 사본.")을 참조하십시오. 
**양식 1040-X.**
양식 1040-X를 사용하여 이미 신고한 세금 신고서의 내용을 수정하십시오.

미납 세액이 있을 경우, IRS에서는 여러 가지 납부 옵션을 제공해드립니다. 앞서 다룬 [_납부 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170632 "납부 방법")을 참조하십시오. 미납 세액은 추정세에 편입된 금액에서 빼드리지 않습니다.
세금 신고 시 미납 세액 전부를 납부할 수 없을 경우, 월부 분납 합의를 요청할 수 있습니다. 앞서 다룬 [_분납 합의_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170652 "분납 합의")를 참조하십시오.
세금을 과다 납부한 경우, 과도 납부액의 전부 또는 일부를 환급 받거나 금액의 전부 또는 일부를 추정세에 적용할 수 있습니다. 환급을 선택할 경우, 원본 세금 신고서에 입력된 환급금과는 별도로 지급됩니다.
_**양식 1040-X 제출하기.**_
양식 1040-X 작성 시, 원본 세금 신고서의 해당 연도를 명시하고 모든 변경 사항을 설명하는 것을 잊지 마십시오. 변경 사항을 설명하는 데 필요한 양식 또는 스케줄을 반드시 모두 첨부하십시오. (양식 1040-X의 지침에 명시된 바와 같이) 양식 1040-X를 귀하의 현재 주소지가 속한 구역을 관활하는 IRS 센터로 우편 발송해주십시오. 단, IRS에서 수령한 안내문에 응답하기 위해 양식 1040-X를 제출하는 경우, 안내문에 명시된 주소로 우편 발송하십시오. 
관련 과세 연도 각각에 대하여 양식을 따로 신고해주십시오. 
양식 1040-X를 전자 제출하여 현연도 또는 이전 두 과세연도에 대한 양식 1040 및 1040-SR을 수정 할 수 있습니다. 더 많은 정보는 양식 1040-X의 지침을 참고하십시오.
**환급 청구 기간.**
일반적으로, 원본 세금을 신고일을 기준으로 3년 이내 또는 세금 납부일을 기준으로 2년 이내 중 더 늦게 도래하는 기한 내에 공제 또는 환급을 청구하는 양식을 제출해야 합니다. 신고 기한(기한 연장 미포함) 전에 신고하였을 경우, (신고 기한일이 토요일, 일요일, 또는 법정 공휴일이었다해도) 신고 기한일에 신고한 것으로 간주됩니다. 이 기한은 귀하에게 (뒤에서 다룰) [재정적 장애가 있는](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170701 "재정적 장애.") 동안에는 유예됩니다. 
공제 또는 환급을 청구할 수 있는 마지막 날이 토요일, 일요일, 또는 법정 공휴일인 경우, 바로 다음 영업일에 청구하십시오. 
이 기간 내에 청구하지 않을 경우, 공제 또는 환급 받을 자격을 잃을 수 있습니다. 
_**연방 정부 선언 재난.**_
연방 정부 선언 재난으로 인해 피해를 입은 경우, 수정된 신고서를 신고할 추가 시간이 주어질 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 556을 참조하십시오.
**환급 보호 청구.**
일반적으로, 보호 청구는 보통 현재 진행 중인 소송이나 세법 또는 기타 법안에 대한 예상 변경 사항에 기반한 공제 또는 환급에 대하여 공식적인 청구를 하거나 수정된 신고서를 제출하는 것을 말합니다. 환급에 대한 귀하의 권리가 미래에 일어날 사건에 달려있으며 시효가 만료되기 전에는 승인 여부를 알 수 없을 경우, 보호 청구 양식을 제출합니다. 유효한 보호 청구일 경우, 구체적인 달러 금액을 명시하거나 즉각 환급을 요구할 필요가 없습니다. 단, 유효한 보호 청구는 다음을 충족해야 합니다. 
  * 서면으로 작성하고 서명할 것,
  * 귀하의 이름, 주소, SSN 또는 ITIN, 및 기타 연락처 정보를 포함시킬 것,
  * 청구 사안에 영향을 주는 조건을 명시하고 설명할 것,

  * 환급을 청구하는 구체적인 연도(들)를 밝힐 것.


_제출 주소_ 하의 양식 1040-X 지침에 등재된 주소로 환급 보호 청구를 우편 발송해주십시오.
일반적으로 IRS는 보호 청구의 승인 요건이 달려 있는 조건이 해소될 때까지 보호 청구에 대한 조치를 연기할 것입니다.
**환급액 제한.**
세금 신고일로부터 3년 이내에 공제 또는 환급을 청구할 경우, 청구 직전의 3년 기간 (세금 신고 기한 연장 가능) 내에 납부한 세액보다 많은 공제금 또는 환급금을 청구할 수 없습니다. 이 기간은 귀하에게 (뒤에서 다룰) [재정적 장애가 있는](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170701 "재정적 장애.") 동안에는 유예됩니다. 
_**납부한 세금.**_
원본 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 미포함) 내에 신고된 추정세를 포함한 납부한 세금은 신고 기한날에 납부한 것으로 간주합니다. 예를 들어, 연중 원천징수되는 소득세는 대부분의 납세자들에게는 4월 15일인 세금 신고 기한 당일에 납부한 것으로 간주합니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하는 $500의 추정세를 납부하였으며 2020년 소득세 신고를 위해 2021년 10월 15일로 신고 기한을 자동 연장 받았습니다. 연장된 신고일에 세금을 신고할 때 $200의 추가 세금을 납부하였습니다. 2024년 10월 15일, 귀하는 수정된 신고서를 신고하고 $700의 환급금을 청구하였습니다. 귀하는 원본 세금을 신고한 후 3년 이내에 청구를 하였기 때문에 3년 내에 납부한 세금에 환급을 청구하기 직전 6개월의 연장 기간 동안 납부한 세금을 합산한 최대 $700를 환급 받을 수 있습니다.
**예시 2.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황이 같으나, 귀하는 연장 기간이 2주 지난 시점인 2021년 10월 30일에 세금을 신고하였습니다. 그 날 귀하는 추가 세금을 $200 납부하였습니다. 2024년 10월 30일, 귀하는 수정된 신고서를 제출하고 $700의 환급금을 청구하였습니다. 귀하는 원본 세금을 신고한 후 3년 내에 환급을 청구하였지만, 환급금은 3년 내에 납부한 세금에 환급을 청구하기 직전 6개월의 연장 기간 동안 납부한 세금을 합산한 $200로 제한되었습니다. 해당 기간 전에 납부한 추정세 $500에 대해서는 환급이나 세액공제를 받을 수 없습니다.
세금을 신고한 후 3년 이상이 지난 시점에 공제 또는 환급을 청구할 경우, 청구 직전 2년 내에 납부한 세액보다 많은 금액을 청구할 수 없습니다. 
**예시 .**
귀하는 2020년 세금 신고서를 2021년 4월 15일에 제출하였습니다. 귀하는 세금을 $500 납부하였습니다. 2022년 11월 5일, 귀하의 2020년 세금 신고서에 대한 감사 결과, 귀하는 추가 세금 $200를 납부해야 했습니다. 2024년 5월 12일, 귀하는 $300의 환급금을 청구하였습니다. 그러나 귀하는 세금을 신고한 후 3년 이상이 지난 시점에 환급을 청구하였기 때문에 귀하의 환급금은 귀하가 청구를 하기 직전 2년 동안 납부한 세금인 $200로 제한됩니다.
**재정적 장애.**
귀하가 재정적 장애가 있는 기간 동안에는 환급을 청구할 수 있는 기간이 유예됩니다. 공동 소득세 신고서의 경우, 한쪽 배우자에게만 재정적 장애가 있어도 기간이 유예됩니다. 사망할 것으로 예상되거나 연속된 12개월 이상 지속되었거나 지속될 것으로 예상할 수 있으며, 의학적으로 판단할 수 있는 신체적 또는 지적 손상으로 인해 재정적 사안을 처리할 수 없는 경우 재정적 장애가 있는 것으로 간주됩니다. 단, 배우자 또는 다른 인물이 귀하를 대신하여 재정적 사안을 처리할 권한을 부여 받은 기간 동안에는 재정적 장애가 있는 것으로 간주되지 않습니다. 
재정적 장애가 있음을 주장하기 위해서는 환급 청구서와 함께 다음과 같은 서면 진술서를 IRS에 발송해야 합니다. 
  1. 다음 사항을 포함한 귀하의 적격 의사가 작성한 진술서. 
    1. 귀하의 신체적 또는 지적 손상을 가리키는 병명 및 손상에 대한 묘사,
    2. 손상으로 인해 귀하가 재정적 사안을 처리할 수 없었음을 설명하는 의사의 의학적 소견,
    3. 해당 손상이 사망으로 이어질 것으로 예상되었거나 예상될 수 있다는 의사의 의학적 소견 또는 손상이 적어도 12개월 동안 지속되었거나 지속될 것으로 예상된다는 의사의 의학적 소견,
    4. 구체적인 기간 (의사의 추정치),
    5. 의사의 서명이 포함된 다음 보증서. “I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the above representations are true, correct, and complete.” (내 지식과 믿음이 허용하는 선에서 나는 위의 진술이 진실하고 정확하며 완전함을 보증한다)
  2. 배우자를 포함하여 어느 누구에게도 귀하에게 장애가 있는 동안 귀하를 대신하여 재정적 사안을 처리할 권한이 부여된 적이 없음을 명시한 (또는 귀하를 대신할 수 있는 권한이 부여된 정확한 기간을 명시한), 공제 또는 환급 청구서에 서명한 자가 작성한 진술서.


**특별한 유형의 환급을 위한 예외 사항.**
다음 목록에 제시된 항목에 대하여 청구를 할 경우, 앞서 논의한 날짜 및 제한이 적용되지 않을 수 있습니다. 다음은 해당 항목 및 이에 대한 자세한 정보를 구할 수 있는 경로입니다.

청구 사안은 보통 청구서를 제출한 뒤 8~12주 이내에 처리됩니다. 귀하의 청구는 제출된 것으로 인정되거나, 각하되거나, 또는 조사 대상으로 분류될 수 있습니다. 청구가 조사 대상인 경우, 조사 절차는 세금 신고서의 조사 절차와 동일합니다.
청구가 각하될 경우, 그 이유에 대한 설명문을 수령하게 됩니다. 
**청구 소송 제기.**
환급에 대하여 소송을 제기할 수도 있습니다. 단, 먼저 IRS에 제때 청구서를 제출해야 합니다. IRS에서 귀하의 청구를 각하하거나 청구서를 제출한 뒤 6개월 이내에 조치를 취하지 않을 경우, 청구 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다. 법정 소송에서의 입증 책임에 대한 정보는 간행물 556을 참조하십시오. 
다음의 경우, IRS에서는 귀하의 청구에 대하여 소송을 제기할 수 있는 직접 소송 방식을 제공해드립니다.
  * 이전에 조사 받은 귀하의 세금 신고서상 문제가 제기된 소득세, 상속세, 또는 증여세에만 기반한 공제 또는 환급에 대하여 청구서를 제출하며,
  * IRS내에서 항소를 제기하는 대신 소송을 제기하고자 한다.


IRS에 청구서를 제출할 때, 귀하의 청구를 즉각 각하해줄 것을 서면으로 요청할 경우, 직접 소송 방식이 제공됩니다. 이러한 경우, 청구 각하 고지서를 보내드립니다.
귀하는 IRS에서 청구 각하 고지서를 발송한 날짜로부터 2년 이내에 관활권이 있는 미국 지방 법원 또는 미국 연방 청구 법원에 청구 소송을 제기할 수 있습니다.
**환급 이자.**
수정된 신고서로 인해 환급금을 수령할 경우, 원본 신고서 제출 기한 또는 귀하가 원본 신고서를 제출한 날짜 중 더 뒤에 오는 날부터 귀하가 수정된 신고서를 제출한 날까지 이자가 지급됩니다. 단, 귀하가 수정된 신고서를 제출 한 뒤 45일 이내에 환급이 이루어지지 않을 경우, 환급금이 지급된 날까지 이자가 지급됩니다. 
**환급금 축소.**
귀하의 환급금은 세무 조사 결과 밝혀진 추가 채납 세금으로 인해 축소될 수 있습니다. 
또한 귀하의 환급금은 체납 연방세, 주 소득세, 주 실업 보상 채무, 자녀양육 보조비, 배우자 생활 보조금, 또는 학자금 대출을 비롯한 그 외의 특정 비과세 연방 부채로 인해 축소될 수 있습니다. 귀하의 배우자에게 이러한 부채가 있는 경우, 앞서 다룬 _환급_ 하의 [_부채 상계_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170621 "부채 상계.")를 참조하여 준수해야 할 올바른 환급 절차를 알아보십시오. 
**주 정부 채납 세금에 대한 영향.**
어떠한 이유로 인해 환급에 변경 사항이 생길 경우, 주 소득세 채납 세금에 영향이 있을 수 있습니다. 여기에는 귀하의 세금 신고서에 대한 IRS 조사 결과 변경된 사항도 포함됩니다. 자세한 정보는 주 정부 세무 기관에 문의해주십시오.
#### 과징금
법에 따라 세금을 신고하지 않거나 세금을 납부하지 않을 경우, 과징금이 부과됩니다.
#### 민사 처벌
기한 내에 세금을 신고하지 않거나 세금을 납부하지 않을 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 또한 세액을 상당 금액 축소하여 신고하거나, 신고 대상 거래액을 축소하여 신고하거나, 환급 또는 공제를 위해 잘못된 청구를 하거나, 불성실한 세금 관련 신고물을 제출하거나, SSN 또는 ITIN을 제시하지 못할 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 세금 신고서에 사기성 정보를 제공할 경우, 민사 사기 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다.
**연체 세금 신고.**
기한 (기한 연장 포함) 내에 세금을 신고하지 않을 경우, 미신고 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 과징금은 보통 세금을 신고하지 않은 달 전체 또는 일부에 대하여 5%가 부과됩니다. 단, 25%를 초과하여 부과되지는 않습니다. 과징금은 기한 (기한 연장 미포함) 내에 납부하지 않은 세금에 따라 부과됩니다. 
_**사기.**_
사기적으로 세금을 신고하지 않은 경우, 과징금은 세금을 신고하지 않은 달 전체 또는 일부에 대하여 15%가 부과되며, 최대 75%까지 부과될 수 있습니다. 
_**60일 넘게 연체 세금 신고서.**_
세금 신고 기한 또는 연장된 신고 기한으로부터 60일 이상 지난 시점에 세금을 신고할 경우, 최소 과징금은 $510 또는 미납 세금의 100% 중 더 적은 금액으로 산정됩니다. 
_**예외.**_
고의적인 방치가 아닌 정당한 사유에 의해 세금을 신고하지 못하였음을 보여줄 경우, 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다.
**늦은 세금 납부.**
납부 기한일로부터 세금을 납부하지 않은 달 전체 또는 일부에 대하여 미납 세금의 1%의 ½ (0.50%)가 미납 과징금로 부과됩니다. 이러한 과징금은 세금 신고 기한일 또는 기한 내에 실제 체납 세금의 최소 90%를 납부하였으며 세금 신고 시 미납 잔액을 납부한 경우, 6개월의 자동 기한 연장 기간 동안에는 적용되지 않습니다. 
특정 달에 대하여 분납 합의가 이루어진 경우, 그 달에 대해서는 미납 과징금이 보통 수준의 절반 (0.50%가 아닌 0.25%)으로 부과됩니다. 이와 같은 과징금 축소를 적용 받기 위해서는 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함) 내에 세금을 신고했어야 합니다.
압류 통보가 발급된 경우, 통보가 발급된 날로부터 적어도 10일이 지난 시점에 시작되는 첫 달부터 과징금율이 1%로 증가합니다. 즉각 납부 통보 및 고지서가 발급된 경우, 통보 및 요청서가 발급된 다음 날이 지난 시점에 시작되는 첫 달부터 1%로 과징금율이 증가합니다.
해당 과징금은 귀하의 미납 세금의 25%를 초과할 수 없습니다. 세금을 제때 납부하지 못한 정당한 사유가 있음을 보여줄 수 있을 경우, 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다.
**과징금 결합.**
(앞서 다룬) 미신고 과징금 및 미납 과징금이 모두 적용되는 달이 있는 경우, 5% (또는 15%)의 미신고 과징금은 미납 과징금만큼 축소됩니다. 단, 세금 신고 기한 또는 연장된 신고 기한으로부터 60일 이상 지난 시점에 세금을 신고할 경우, 최소 과징금은 $510 또는 미납 세금의 100% 중 더 적은 금액으로 산정됩니다. 
**정확성 관련 과징금.**
다음과 같은 사유로 충분한 세액을 납부하지 않을 경우, 정확성 관련 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 
  1. 규칙 또는 규정에 부주의하거나 이를 무시한 경우.
  2. 소득세를 상당 금액 축소한 경우.
  3. 경제적 실체가 없는 거래에 대하여 세금 혜택을 청구했거나. 또는
  4. 해외 금융 자산을 공개하지 않은 경우.


과징금은 납부 미달금의 20%입니다. 경제적 실체가 없는 거래 또는 해외 금융 자산거래를 공개하지 않은 데 따른 세금 축소에 대해서는 납부 미달금의 40%의 과징금이 부과됩니다. (뒤에서 다룰) 사기 과징금이 부과된 납부 미달금에 대해서는 해당 과징금이 전혀 산정되지 않습니다. 
_**과실 또는 무시.**_
“과실”이란 용어는 세법 준수를 위해 합당한 노력을 기울이지 않거나 세금 신고서를 작성하는 데 보통의 합당한 관심을 기울이지 않는 행위를 포함하여 가리킵니다. 또한 과실에는 충분한 장부 및 기록물을 보관하지 않은 행위도 포함됩니다. 귀하가 취한 행동에 정당한 근거가 있을 경우, 과실 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
“무시”라는 용어에는 경솔함, 무모함, 또는 고의성에 따른 무시 행위가 포함됩니다. 
_**적절한 공개.**_
적어도 어느 정도 정당한 근거를 제시하여 귀하의 입장을 세금 신고서에 충분히 공개할 경우, 규칙 또는 규정을 무시한 대가로 과징금이 부과되는 것을 피할 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_공개 진술서_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170725 "공개 진술서.")를 참조하십시오. 
이러한 예외는 세금 탈세 조치에 의한 항목에는 적용되지 않습니다. 또한 적당한 장부 및 기록물을 보관하지 않았거나 해당 항목을 적절히 입증하지 못할 경우에도 적용되지 않습니다. 
_**상당한 소득세 축소.**_
올바른 세액보다 적은 금액을 세금 신고서에 표시하면 세액을 축소한 것입니다. 올바른 세액의 10% 또는 $5,000 중 더 높은 금액보다 많은 금액을 축소한 경우, 축소한 금액이 상당하다고 말합니다. 단, 다음에 의한 경우에 한해 축소된 금액을 감소시킬 수 있습니다. 
  1. 상당한 권위, 또는
  2. 충분한 공개 및 정당한 근거. 


귀하의 세금 신고서에 포함된 항목이 세금 탈세 조치에 의한 경우, 충분한 공개에 따라 금액이 감소되지 않습니다. 귀하의 세금 처리가 올바른 것일 가능성이 높다고 합리적으로 믿었을 경우에 한해, 상당한 권위 있는 자리에 대해 금액 감소가 이루어집니다. 
_**상당한 권위.**_
특정 항목에 대한 세무 처리에 있어 상당한 권위가 존재했는지 여부는 사실 관계 및 상황에 달려 있습니다. 고려 대상인 항목에는 법원 의견, 재무부 규정, 세무 판결, 세무 절차, 및 귀하의 상황과 동일하거나 비슷한 상황이 포함된, IRS에서 작성하여 연방IRS 관보에 게재한 안내문 및 공고가 포함됩니다. 
_**공개 진술서.**_
귀하의 세금 처리에 관한 관련된 사실 관계를 충분히 공개하고자 할 경우, 양식 8275을 사용하십시오. 또한 해당 항목을 그와 같이 처리한 정당한 근거가 존재해야 합니다. 
상당한 금액 축소에 있어서만은 세무 절차 2023-40 (또는 추후 업데이트될 버전)에 제신된 요건을 충족하는 항목에 대해서는 양식 8275을 신고하지 않아도 세금 신고서에 충분히 공개한 것으로 간주합니다. 
양식 8275-R을 사용하여 규정을 어긴 항목 또는 입장에 관해 공개하십시오. 
_**경제적 실체가 없는 거래.**_
경제적 실체에 관한 자세한 정보는 섹션 7701(o)를 참조하십시오.
_**해외 금융 자산.**_
공개하지 않은 해외 금융 자산에 관한 자세한 정보는 섹션 6662(j)를 참조하십시오.
_**정당한 사유.**_
귀하가 특정 항목을 그와 같이 처리한 적절한 이유 (정당한 사유)가 존재함을 보일 경우, 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 또한 선의를 갖고 행동했음을 보여야 합니다. 단, 경제적 실체가 없는 거래에는 이와 같은 사항이 적용되지 않습니다.
**환급 또는 세액 공제에 대한 오류적 청구.**
환급 또는 공제를 위해 오류적 청구를 한 경우, 과징금을 납부해야 할 수 도 있습니다. 귀하가 특정 항목을 그와 같이 처리한 정당한 근거가 존재함을 보일 수 있지 않는 한, 각하된 청구 금액의 20%와 동일한 금액이 과징금로 부과됩니다. 단, 경제적 실체가 없는 거래로 인해 각하된 금액에 대해서는 합리적인 근거가 존재하는 것으로 취급되지 않습니다. 과징금은 정확성 관련 과징금 또는 사기 과징금이 부과된 근로 소득 세액공제와 관련된 청구 금액에 대해서는 전혀 산정되지 않습니다.
**경솔한 세금 관련 신고물.**
경솔한 세금 신고서 또는 기타 경솔한 신고를 한 경우, $5,000의 과징금을 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 경솔한 세금 신고서란 정확한 세액을 산정하기 위한 충분한 정보가 포함되지 않은 세금 신고서 또는 귀하가 신고한 세금이 상당한 정도로 정확하지 않음을 명확히 보여주는 정보를 담은 세금 신고서를 말합니다. 경솔한 세금 신고서, 불성실한 신고, 및 불성실한 것으로 판단되는 입장 목록에 관한 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov/irb/2010-17_IRB/ar13.html(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2010-17_IRB/ar13.html)에서 제공되는 공지 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609를 참조하십시오.
경솔한 입장 또는 연방세법의 행정 업무를 지연시키거나 방해하기 위한 의도로 이와 같은 세금 신고서 또는 신고물을 신고한 경우, 과징금을 납부해야 합니다. 서명을 위해 제공된 빈칸 위에 인쇄된 언어를 변경하거나 삭제하는 것 또한 여기에 포함됩니다. 
해당 과징금은 법에 따라 부과되는 다른 모든 과징금에 더하여 부과됩니다. 
**사기.**
사기 행각을 벌여 세금을 충분히 납부하지 않은 경우, 납세 미달금에 대해 75%의 사기로 인한 과징금이 세금에 더해집니다. 
_**공동 신고서.**_
납부 미달된 금액의 일부가 어느 한쪽 배우자의 사기 행위로 인한 것이 아닌 한, 공동 신고서에 대한 사기 과징금은 해당 배우자에게는 적용되지 않습니다. 
**SSN 미제공.**
세금 신고서, 진술서, 또는 기타 서류에 SSN을 제공하도록 한 곳에 귀하 또는 타인의 SSN을 포함시키지 않은 경우, 이를 제공하지 않은 횟수에 따라 매회 $50의 과징금이 부과됩니다. 세금 신고서, 진술서, 또는 기타 서류에 귀하의 SSN을 타인에게 제공할 것을 명시한 경우에도 이를 제공하지 않은 경우, $50의 과징금이 부과됩니다. 
예를 들어, 이자가 발생하는 은행 계좌를 보유한 경우, 은행에 귀하의 SSN을 제공해야 합니다. 양식 1099-INT 또는 은행에서 귀하에게 보내는 기타 명세서에 이 번호가 반드시 표시되어야 합니다. 은행에 귀하의 SSN을 제공하지 않을 경우, $50 과징금이 부과됩니다. (또한 소득세의 “backup” (예비) 원천징수가 이루어질 수도 있습니다. [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세")을 참조하십시오.) 
고의적인 방치가 아닌 정당한 사유에 의해 SSN을 제공하지 못한 것임을 보여준 경우, 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
#### 형사 처벌
다음과 같은 행위에 대해 형사 기소 (재판에 회부)가 이루어질 수 있습니다.
  1. 조세 포탈,

#### 혼인 여부
일반적으로, 귀하의 납세자 구분은 귀하가 미혼으로 간주되는지 혹은 기혼으로 간주되는지에 달려있습니다.
**미혼인 사람.**
과세 연도 말일 기준 다음에 해당할 경우, 귀하는 해당 연도 내내 미혼인 것으로 간주됩니다.
  * 미혼, 또는
  * 이혼이나 별거 생활 유지 명령에 따라 배우자와 법적으로 별거.


주 법에 따라서 귀하가 기혼인지 또는 이혼이나 별거 생활 유지 명령에 따라 배우자와 법적으로 별거한 상태인지가 결정됩니다.
**혼인의 정의.**
두 사람의 혼인은 법적 거주지에 관계없이 혼인이 시작된 미국의 주 또는 미국의 영토에서 결혼을 인정하는 경우 연방 세금 목적상 인정됩니다. 외국 관할권 또는 아메리칸 인디언 부족의 법률에 따라 결혼으로 명칭되는 관계를 맺은 두 사람은 법적 거주지와 관계없이 미국 내 적어도 하나의 주 또는 미국의 영토의 법률에 따라 결혼으로 인정되는 경우, 연방 세금 목적상 기혼으로 인정됩니다. 등록된 동거관계, 동성 결혼 또는 그러한 관계가 체결된 미국 주 또는 미국 영토의 법률에 따라 결혼으로 분류되지 않은 기타 유사한 관계를 맺은 개인은 법적 거주지에 관계없이 연방 세금 목적상 합법적으로 결혼한 것이 아닙니다. [_기혼으로 간주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170745 "기혼으로 간주.")를 참조하십시오.
_**이혼한 사람.**_
연말까지 최종령에 따라 이혼한 경우, 귀하는 해당 연도 내내 미혼인 것으로 간주됩니다. 
_**이혼 및 재혼.**_
오직 미혼 개인으로 세금 신고서를 제출하기 위한 목적으로만 이혼을 했고, 이혼 시점에 다음 과세 연도에 재혼할 의도가 있었으며 그에 따라 재혼한 경우, 두 해 모두 기혼 개인으로 신고해야 합니다. 
_**혼인 취소.**_
유효성 있는 혼인이 성립된 적이 없음을 명시한 혼인 취소 법원 명령이 내려진 경우, 이전 연도에 대하여 공동 신고서를 제출했어도 미혼인 것으로 간주됩니다. 혼인 취소로 인해 영향을 받은, 세금 신고 소멸 시효가 만료되지 않은 모든 과세 연도에 대하여 미혼 또는 세대주 납세자 구분을 청구하는 양식 1040-X, ‘수정된 미국 개인 소득세 신고서’를 제출하십시오. 일반적으로 공제 또는 환급을 청구하기 위해서는 원본 세금 신고서 제출일을 기준으로 3년 이내 (기한 연장 포함) 또는 세금 납부일을 기준으로 2년 이내 중 더 늦게 도래하는 기한 내에 양식 1040-X를 제출해야 합니다. 원본 세금 신고서를 일찍 (예를 들어 3월 1일에) 제출한 경우, 귀하의 세금 신고서는 신고 기한 (일반적으로 4월 15일)에 제출된 것으로 간주됩니다. 단, 신고 기한 연장 (예를 들어 10월 15일까지)을 받았으나 기한보다 일찍 제출하여 당국이 7월 1일에 귀하의 세금 신고서를 수령한 경우, 해당 신고서는 7월 1일에 제출된 것으로 간주됩니다.
_**세대주 또는 적격 생존 배우자.**_
미혼으로 간주될 경우, 세대주 또는 적격 생존 배우자로서 납세자 구분을 신청할 수도 있습니다. 신청 자격이 되는지 알아보고자 할 경우, 이후에 [_세대주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170792 "세대주") 및 [_적격 생존 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170830 "적격 생존 배우자")를 참조하십시오. 
**기혼자.**
기혼으로 간주될 경우, 귀하 또는 배우자는 공동 신고서 제출을 하거나 개별 신고서 제출을 할 수 있습니다. 
_**기혼으로 간주.**_
과세 연도 말일 기준 다음 중 귀하 또는 배우자에게 해당하는 경우가 하나라도 있을 경우, 귀하 및 배우자는 해당 연도 내내 기혼인 것으로 간주됩니다. 
  1. 기혼이며 배우자와 함께 살고있는 경우. 
  2. 현재 거주하는 주 또는 관습법상의 결혼 생활을 시작한 주에서 인정하는 관습법상의 결혼을 한 상태에서 배우자와 함께 살고있는 경우. 
  3. 배우자와 혼인한 상태에서 따로 살지만, 이혼 또는 별거 생활 유지 명령에 따라 배우자와 법적으로 별거한 상태는 아닌 경우. 
  4. 이혼 중간 (최종이 아닌) 명령에 따라 별거한 상태인 경우.


_**배우자가 연중에 사망한 경우.**_
귀하의 배우자가 연중에 사망한 경우, 납세자 구분 목적으로는 해당 연도 전체에 대하여 기혼인 것으로 고려됩니다. 
과세 연도 말까지 재혼하지 않았을 경우, 귀하 및 귀하의 사망한 배우자와 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 또한 향후 2년 동안 뒤에서 다룰 [_적격 생존 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170830 "적격 생존 배우자") 하에서 설명하는 특별 혜택을 적용 받을 수도 있습니다.
과세 연도 말이 되기 전에 재혼한 경우, 새 배우자와 함께 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 해당 연도에 대한 사망한 배우자의 납세자 구분은 부부 개별 신고입니다. 
_**별거중인 기혼자.**_
배우자와 따로 살며 특정 테스트 조건을 충족할 경우, 이혼 또는 법적으로 별거한 상태가 아니어도 납세자 구분을 세대주로 신청할 수도 있습니다. 납세자 구분을 부부 개별 신고가 아닌 세대주로 신청할 자격이 있는 경우, 표준 공제가 높아집니다. 또한 세금이 더 적게 부과될 수 있으며, 근로 소득 세액공제를 (EIC) 청구할 수도 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_세대주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170792 "세대주")를 참조하십시오. 
#### 미혼
미혼인 것으로 간주되며 다른 납세자 구분에 해당되지 않을 경우, 납세자 구분을 미혼으로 신청해야 합니다. 귀하의 혼인 여부를 알아보고자 할 경우, 앞에서 다룬 [_혼인 여부_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170736 "혼인 여부")를 참조하십시오.
**2024년 1월 1일전에 배우자가 사망함.**
2024년 1월 1일 이전에 귀하의 배우자가 사망했으며 2024년 말이 되기 전에 귀하가 재혼하지 않았을 경우, 귀하의 납세자 구분은 미혼일 수도 있습니다. 단, 세금이 더 적게 부과되는 다른 납세자 구분을 사용할 수도 있습니다. 신청 자격이 되는지 알아보고자 할 경우, 뒤에서 다룰 [_세대주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170792 "세대주") 및 [_적격 생존 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170830 "적격 생존 배우자")를 참조하십시오. 
**신고 방법.**
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 상단 근처의 _납세자 구분_ 줄에 “Single” (미혼)으로 표시된 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하여 귀하의 납세자 구분을 미혼으로 나타내십시오. 세금표의 _미혼_ 열 또는 세금 계산 용지의 섹션 A를 사용하여 귀하의 세금을 산정하십시오. 
#### 부부 공동 신고
기혼으로 간주되며 귀하와 배우자 모두 공동 신고서를 제출하기로 합의했을 경우, 귀하의 납세자 구분을 부부 공동 신고로 선택할 수 있습니다. 공동 신고서 상에서 귀하와 배우자의 합산한 소득을 신고 및 합산 허용가능 비용을 공제하십시오. 귀하와 배우자 중 한쪽에게는 소득이 발생하지 않았거나 공제할 사안이 없는 경우에도 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다.
귀하와 배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출하기로 한 경우, 다른 납세자 구분으로 신고했을 때의 합산 세금보다 세금이 적을 수 있습니다. 또한 (항목별 공제를 청구하지 않을 경우) 표준 공제가 높을 수 있으며, 다른 납세자 구분에는 적용되지 않는 세금 혜택을 적용 받을 수도 있습니다.
**신고 방법.**
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 상단 근처의 _납세자 구분_ 라인에 “Married filing jointly” (부부 공동 신고)로 표시된 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하여 납세자 구분을 부부 공동 신고로 나타내십시오. 세금표의 _부부 공동 신고_ 열 또는 세금 계산 용지의 섹션 B를 사용하여 귀하의 세금을 산정하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하와 배우자 모두 소득이 있을 경우, 공동 신고서 및 (부부 개별 신고 납세자 구분을 사용하여) 개별 신고서를 모두 사용하여 세금을 산정해보는 것이 좋습니다. 개별 신고서의 제출이 요구되지 않는 이상, 합산 세액이 더 낮은 방식을 선택하면 됩니다._.
**배우자 사망.**
귀하의 배우자가 연중에 사망한 경우, 납세자 구분상으로는 해당 연도 전체에 대하여 기혼인 것으로 간주되며 납세자 구분을 부부 공동 신고로 선택할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 앞에서 다룬 _기혼자_ 아래에 소개된 [_배우자의 연중 사망_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170746 "배우자가 연중에 사망한 경우.")을 참조하십시오. 
2024년 세금 신고서를 제출하기 전 2025년에 배우자가 사망한 경우, 2024년 세금 신고서에 대하여 귀하의 납세자 구분을 부부 공동 신고로 선택할 수 있습니다.
**이혼한 사람.**
연말까지 최종령에 따라 이혼한 경우, 귀하는 해당 연도 내내 미혼인 것으로 간주되며 납세자 구분을 부부 공동 신고로 선택할 수 없습니다. 
#### 공동 신고서 제출
공동 신고서에는 귀하와 배우자의 모든 소득 및 공제를 포함시켜야 합니다.
**회계기간.**
귀하와 배우자는 반드시 동일한 회계기간을 사용해야 하지만 서로 다른 회계처리 방법을 사용하는 것은 가능합니다. 1장에서 [_회계기간_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170551 "회계기간") 및 [_회계처리 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170553 "회계처리 방법")을 참조하십시오. 
**공동 책임.**
귀하와 배우자 양쪽 모두 공동 신고서에 신고한 세금 및 이자 또는 과징금에 대해서 공동 및 개별적으로 책임이 있을 수 있습니다. 따라서 배우자 한쪽이 내야할 세금을 납부하지 않을 경우, 다른 배우자가 이를 납부해야 할 수 도 있습니다. 또는 배우자 한쪽이 정확한 세금을 신고하지 않을 경우, 배우자 양쪽 모두 IRS 세무 조사를 통해 산정된 추가 세금을 납부해야 할 책임이 부과될 수 있습니다. 모든 소득이 배우자 한쪽에게 발생했어도 그에 따른 세금 전체를 납부할 책임이 다른 배우자에게 부과될 수 있습니다. 
다음에 해당할 경우, 개별로 신고하는 편이 좋을 수 있습니다.
  * 배우자가 자신의 소득 전체를 신고하지 않고 있다고 생각하는 경우, 또는
  * 배우자가 원천징수를 통해 충분한 세금을 납부하고 있지 않거나 충분한 추정세액을 납부하고 있지 않아 미납 세금에 대해 책임이 부과되는 것을 피하고자 하는 경우.


_**이혼한 납세자.**_
이혼 전에 제출한 공동 신고서에 부과된 세금, 이자 및 과징금에 대하여 부부 공동 및 개별적으로 책임이 있을 수 도 있습니다. 이러한 책임 관계는 이혼 전에 제출한 공동 신고서에 따른 미납 세액에 대한 책임이 귀하의 전 배우자에게 있음을 이혼 판결문이 명시한 경우에도 적용될 수 있습니다. 
_**공동 책임에 대한 면제.**_
배우자 한쪽이 공동 신고서에 잘못 신고한 항목에 따른 세금, 이자 및 과징금에 대한 부부 공동 책임이 다른 배우자에 대하여 면제되는 상황도 있습니다. 아무리 적은 금액이어도 체납 세금에 대해서 면제를 요청할 수 있습니다. 
면제 유형에는 세 가지가 있습니다. 
  1. 무고한 배우자에 대한 면제.
  2. 채무 분리 (이혼, 배우자가 사망한, 법적 별거 상태, 또는 해당 면제 신청일을 마지막 날로 산정한 12개월 동안 함께 살지 않은 공동 신고자에게만 적용 가능).
  3. 형평적 면제.


부부 공동 책임 면제를 신청하고자 할 경우, 양식 8857, ‘무고한 배우자에 대한 면제 요청’을 제출해야 합니다. 간행물 971은 이러한 구제책에 관해 설명하고 있으며 이에 대한 신청 자격에 관해서도 다루고 있습니다.
**공동 신고서에 서명하기.**
공동 신고서로 간주되기 위해서는 일반적으로 배우자 양쪽 모두 신고서에 서명을 해야 합니다. 
_**서명을 하기 전 사망한 배우자.**_
신고서에 서명을 하기 전에 배우자가 사망한 경우, 집행인 또는 관리자가 배우자를 대신하여 서명을 해야 합니다. 귀하를 포함한 그 누구도 집행인 또는 관리자로 지명되지 않은 경우, 귀하가 배우자를 대신하여 세금 신고서에 서명한 뒤 서명 영역에 “Filing as surviving spouse” (생존한 배우자로서 세금 신고)를 기입하십시오.
_**가정에서 떨어져 있는 배우자.**_
배우자가 가정에서 떨어져 있는 경우, 세금 신고서를 제때에 제출할 수 있도록 신고서를 작성하여 서명을 한 뒤 배우자가 서명할 수 있도록 배우자에게 전달해야 합니다.
_**상해 또는 질병으로 인한 서명 불가.**_
배우자가 질병 또는 상해로 인해 서명을 할 수 없어 귀하에게 대신 서명해줄 것을 요청한 경우, 세금 신고서의 알맞은 빈칸에 배우자의 이름을 서명한 후 “By (your name), Spouse” (배우자인 (귀하의 이름) 서명함) 이라는 문구를 덧붙이십시오. 귀하가 서명해야 하는 빈칸에도 반드시 서명을 해주십시오. 세금 신고서에 날짜를 명시하고 귀하의 서명을 입력한 진술서를 첨부하십시오. 진술서에는 귀하가 제출하는 세금 신고서의 양식 번호, 과세 연도, 및 배우자가 서명을 할 수 없는 이유를 포함시켜야 하며; 또한 귀하가 배우자를 대신하여 서명하는 것에 배우자가 동의했음을 명시해야 합니다. 
_**배우자의 보호자로서 서명하기.**_
지적 장애가 있는 배우자의 보호자인 경우, 보호자로서 귀하의 배우자를 대신하여 신고서에 서명을 할 수 있습니다. 
_**전투 지역에 복무 중인 배우자.**_
배우자가 (페르시아 만 영역, 세르비아, 몬테네그로, 알바니아, 또는 아프가니스탄과 같은) 전투 지역에 복무 중인 관계로 공동 신고서에 서명을 할 수 없는 경우, 위임장 또는 기타 진술서 없이도 귀하가 대신 서명을 할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 배우자가 전투 지역에서 복무 중임을 설명하는 진술서에 서명을 한 후 세금 신고서에 첨부하십시오. 전투 지역에 복무 중이거나 전투 지역 복무 중에 실종된 개인에 대한 특별세 규칙에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 3을 참조하십시오.
_**위임장.**_
이러한 상황에 해당하여 배우자를 대신하여 세금 신고서에 서명을 하고자 할 경우, 배우자를 대신하여 서명할 권한을 부여하는 위임장 (POA)을 세금 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 귀하에게 세금 신고서에 대신 서명할 권한을 부여함을 명시한 POA를 사용하거나 양식 2848을 사용하십시오. 양식 2848의 파트 I 에는 귀하가 세금 신고서에 대신 서명할 권한을 부여 받은 사실이 명시되어야 합니다.
**비거주 외국인 또는 이중 신분 외국인.**
일반적으로, 과세 연도 기간 중 어느 때라도 배우자 한쪽이 비거주 외국인인 부부는 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 없습니다. 단, 해당 연도 말 기준 비거주 외국인 또는 이중 신분 외국인인 한쪽 배우자가 미국 시민이나 영주권자와 혼인한 상태인 부부는 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 공동 신고서를 제출하면 과세 연도 전 기간 동안 귀하와 배우자 모두 미국 시민인 것으로 간주됩니다. 간행물 519 1장을 참조하십시오. 
#### 부부 개별 신고
귀하가 기혼인 경우, 납세자 구분을 부부 개별 신고로 선택할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 세금에 대해서만 책임을 지고자 하거나 공동 신고서 제출을 했을 때보다 세액이 적게 산정될 경우, 이 납세자 구분이 귀하에게는 더 이로울 수 있습니다.
귀하와 배우자가 공동 신고서 제출을 하는 것에 합의하지 않은 경우, 뒤에서 다룰 세대주 납세자 구분에 해당하지 않는 한 부부 개별 신고 납세자 구분을 사용해야 합니다.
귀하가 배우자와 떨어져 생활하고 특정 테스트 (뒤에서 다룰 [_세대주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170792 "세대주") 아래에 소개될 예정) 요건을 충족할 경우, 세대주 납세자 구분을 선택하는 것이 가능할 수도 있습니다. 이는 귀하가 이혼했거나 법적으로 별거하지 않았다 하더라도 적용될 수 있습니다. 부부 개별 신고가 아닌 세대주로 신고할 수 있을 경우, 세액이 더 낮게 산정될 수 있고, EIC를 비롯한 기타 혜택을 청구할 수도 있으며, 표준 공제가 더 높게 책정됩니다. 세대주 납세자 구분으로 신고하였을 경우, 배우자가 항목별 공제를 선택하였어도 귀하는 표준 공제를 선택할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_세대주_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170792 "세대주")를 참조하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_뒤에서 다룰_[특별 규칙](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170782 "특별 규칙") _아래에 소개될 사유로 인해 부부 개별 신고에 따른 합산 세액은 공동 신고를 했을 때보다 일반적으로 높게 산정됩니다. 그러나 별도 제출이 요구되는 경우를 제외하고는 두 가지 방식을 (공동 신고서 및 개별 신고서) 모두 사용하여 세금을 산정해보십시오. 이를 통해 합산 세액이 가장 적은 납세자 구분을 사용하고 있음을 확신할 수 있습니다. 기혼 부부의 합산 세액을 산정할 때에는 연방 세금뿐만 아니라 주정부 세금 또한 고려하는 것이 좋습니다._.
**신고 방법.**
개별 신고서를 제출할 경우, 귀하는 일반적으로 귀하의 소득과 공제만을 신고하게 됩니다. 
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 상단 근처의 _납세자 구분_ 줄에 표시된 “Married filing separately” (부부 개별 신고)의 빈칸에 체크 표시를 하여 해당 납세자 구분을 선택하십시오. _납세자 구분_ 섹션 하단의 빈칸에 배우자의 전체 이름과 사회 보장 번호 (SSN) 또는 개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN)을 입력하십시오. 배우자가 SSN이나 ITIN을 보유하지 않고 보유할 의무가 없는 경우, 배우자의 SSN을 입력하는 빈칸에 “NRA” (비거주 외국인의 영어 약자)를 입력하십시오. 세금표의 _부부 개별 신고_ 열 또는 세금 계산 용지의 섹션 C를 사용하여 귀하의 세금을 산정하십시오.
#### 특별 규칙
귀하의 납세자 구분을 부부 개별 신고로 선택할 경우, 다음과 같은 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이러한 특별 규칙 때문에 개별 신고서 제출을 할 경우, 귀하에게 해당되는 다른 어떤 납세자 구분을 사용할 때보다 보통 더 높은 세금을 납부해야 합니다.
  1. 공동 신고서 보다 일반적으로 세율이 높게 책정됩니다.
  2. 대체 최저세 산정을 위한 면제액이 공동 신고서에서 허용되는 금액의 절반입니다.
  3. 대부분의 경우, 자녀 및 부양 가족 보육비를 공제 받을 수 없고, 고용주의 부양 가족 보육비 지원 프로그램 하에 귀하의 소득에서 제외할 수 있는 금액도 $2,500 (공동 신고서는 $5,000)로 제한됩니다. 단, 배우자와 법적으로 별거하였거나 따로 살고 있을 경우, 부부 개별 신고를 하고도 해당 세액공제를 받는 것이 가능할 수도 있습니다. 이러한 비용, 공제, 및 제외에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 503 에 있는 _귀하의 납세자 구분은 무엇입니까?_ 를 참조하십시오.
  4. 적격 자녀가 있으며 다른 특정 요구사항에 적합하지 않는 이상, EIC 를 받을 수 없습니다. 간행물 596을 참조하십시오.
  5. 대부분의 경우, 입양 비용에 대해 제외 또는 공제를 받을 수 없습니다.
  6. 교육비 세액공제 (미국 시민 기회 세액공제 및 평생 교육비 세액공제), 또는 학자금 대출 이자 공제를 받을 수 없습니다.
  7. 고등 교육 비용을 위해 이용한 적격 미국 저축 채권에서 발생한 이자 소득을 제외할 수 없습니다.
  8. 과세 연도 중에 배우자와 함께 산 적이 있을 경우, 다음 규칙이 적용됩니다.

    2. 귀하가 수령한 사회보장 혜택 또는 이에 상응하는 철도 종업원의 은퇴 플랜 혜택의 보다 높은 비율 (최대 85%)을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
  9. 공동 신고서상의 절반인 소득 수준에서 다음 세액공제가 축소됩니다:
    1. 자녀 세액공제 및 다른 부양 가족에 대한 세액공제.
    2. 은퇴 저축 기여 세액공제.
  10. 자본 손실 세액공제 한도가 $1,500 (공동 신고서 제출을 했다면 $3,000)입니다. 
  11. 배우자가 항목별 공제를 청구할 경우, 귀하는 표준 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 표준 공제를 청구할 수 있는 경우, 귀하의 기본 표준 공제는 공동 신고서 제출을 했을 때의 절반만큼 허용됩니다.


**조정 총 소득 (AGI) 한도.**
개별 신고서를 제출했을 때 귀하의 AGI가 공동 신고서 제출을 했을 때보다 낮을 경우, 의료 비용을 비롯하여 AGI에 의해 제한되는 특정 비용을 더 많이 공제 받을 수도 있습니다.
**개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA).**
해당 연도 동안 귀하 또는 배우자가 직장에서 종업원 은퇴 연금 플랜에 의해 보장을 받은 경우, 전통적 IRA에 대한 기부금 전부 또는 일부를 공제 받지 못할 수도 있습니다. 귀하의 소득이 일정 금액을 초과할 경우, 비용 공제가 축소되거나 폐지됩니다. 이 한도액은 부부 개별 신고를 하고 해당 연도 중에 함께 살았던 적이 있는 기혼자에 대해서는 훨씬 낮은 금액이 적용됩니다. 자세한 정보는 9장에서 [_공제가능 금액_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172620 "공제 가능 금액")을 참조하십시오. 
**임대 활동으로 인한 손실.**
손실이 발생한 피동적 부동산 임대 활동에 활발하게 참여한 경우, 일반적으로 최대 $25,000까지 해당 손실을 비피동적 소득에서 공제할 수 있습니다. 이를 특별 허용이라고 부릅니다. 단, 부부 개별 신고를 하고 해당 연도 중에 함께 살았던 적이 있는 기혼 부부는 이러한 특별 허용을 신청할 수 없습니다. 부부 개별 신고를 하고 해당 연도 내내 따로 생활한 기혼 부부에게는 피동적 부동산 관련 활동으로 인한 손실에 대해 최대 $12,500의 특별 허용액이 각각 허용됩니다. 간행물 925에 있는 _임대 손실 한도_ 를 참조하십시오. 
**공동 재산 인정 주.**
귀하가 공동 재산을 인정하는 주에서 거주하고 부부 개별 신고를 한 경우, 소득세 산정에 있어 귀하의 소득은 별도 소득 또는 공동 소득으로 간주될 수 있습니다. 공동 재산을 인정하는 주에는 애리조나, 캘리포니아, 아이다호, 루이지애나, 네바다, 뉴멕시코, 텍사스, 워싱턴 및 위스콘신이 포함됩니다. 더 자세한 정보는 간행물 555을 참조하십시오. 
#### 개별 신고서에서 공동 신고서로 변경
양식 1040-X를 사용하여 수정된 신고서를 제출하면 납세자 구분을 개별 신고에서 공동 신고로 변경할 수 있습니다.
일반적으로 부부 개별 신고 기한으로부터 3년 이내라면 언제든지 공동 신고서 제출로 변경할 수 있습니다. 여기에 기한 연장은 포함되지 않습니다. 부부 개별 신고서에는 귀하 또는 배우자가 부부 개별 신고자, 미혼, 또는 세대주로서 제출한 세금 신고서가 포함됩니다.
#### 공동 신고서에서 개별 신고서로 변경

#### 예외
적격 자녀 또는 적격 친척이 있더라도 다음 세 가지 테스트 요건을 충족해야만 귀하가 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
  1. [부양 가족 납세자 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170865 "부양 가족 납세자 테스트").
  2. [공동 신고서 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170866 "공동 신고서 테스트").
  3. [시민 또는 거주자 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170870 "시민 또는 거주자 테스트").


이 세 가지 테스트를 여기서 자세히 설명해드립니다.
#### 부양 가족 납세자 테스트
다른 납세자가 귀하를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있을 경우, 귀하는 어느 누구도 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 적격 자녀 또는 적격 친척이 있더라도 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
귀하와 배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출하며 다른 납세자가 귀하와 배우자를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있을 경우, 귀하와 배우자는 공동 신고서에 어느 누구도 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예외.**
다른 납세자가 귀하 (또는 공동 신고를 할 경우, 귀하의 배우자)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있을 경우, 이 납세자가 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부한 추정세에 대한 환급 청구를 목적으로서만 세금 신고서를 제출한다면, 귀하는 다른 사람을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
#### 공동 신고서 테스트
일반적으로 공동 신고서를 제출하는 기혼자를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예외.**
오직 소득세 원천징수 또는 추정세 납부에 대한 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출한 개인과 배우자라면, 공동 신고서를 제출했더라도 이 사람을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 1—자녀가 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
귀하는 만 18세 자녀를 부양하였고 이 자녀의 배우자가 군 복무를 하는 동안 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 자녀의 배우자는 해당 연도에 대해 $35,000의 소득을 얻었습니다. 이 둘은 공동 신고서 제출을 합니다. 귀하의 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 2—자녀가 오직 원천징수된 세금에 대해 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
귀하의 만 18세 자녀와 이 자녀의 만 17세 배우자는 시간제 근로에 대한 임금으로 $800를 받았고 다른 소득은 없었습니다. 이 둘은 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 귀하의 자녀와 자녀의 배우자 모두 세금 신고서를 제출할 의무가 없습니다. 그들에게는 자녀가 없습니다. 그들의 임금에서 세금이 공제되었기 때문에 그들은 오직 원천징수된 세금을 환급 받기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 하였습니다. 공동 신고서 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용되기 때문에 그들이 공동 신고서 제출을 했더라도 귀하는 그들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다. 그들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있도록 하는 다른 모든 테스트 요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하는 그들을 각각 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 3—자녀가 미국 인 기회 세액공제를 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
_예시 2_ 와 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 자녀의 임금이나 자녀의 배우자의 임금에서 세금이 공제되지 않았습니다. 단, 그들은 $124의 미국인 기회 세액공제를 청구하여 해당 금액을 환급 받기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 합니다. 자녀가 미국 시민 기회 세액공제를 청구하는 공동 신고서를 제출 했기 떄문에 그들은 오직 소득세 원천징수 또는 추정세 납부에 대한 환급을 받기 위해 세금 신고서를 제출한 것이 아닙니다. 공동 신고서 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용되지 않기 때문에 귀하는 그들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
#### 시민 또는 거주자 테스트
해당 개인이 미국 시민, 미국 거주 외국인, 미국인이나 캐나다 또는 멕시코 거주자가 아니면, 일반적으로 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 단, 다음에서 설명할 바와 같이 특정 입양된 자녀에 관해서는 예외가 있습니다.
**입양 자녀에 관한 예외.**
귀하가 미국 시민, 미국 거주 외국인, 또는 미국인이 아닌 자녀를 입양한 미국 시민 또는 미국인일 경우, 해당 자녀가 귀하의 가족 구성원으로 1년 내내 귀하와 함께 살았다면 테스트 요건을 충족합니다. 이러한 예외는 법적 입양을 위해 법적으로 자녀를 위탁 받았고 이 자녀가 위탁 후 그 해에 함께 살았던 경우에도 적용됩니다.
**자녀의 거주지.**
일반적으로 자녀는 부모가 속한 국가의 시민이나 거주자입니다.
자녀가 출생한 시점에 귀하가 미국 시민이었으면, 자녀의 다른 부모가 비거주 외국인이고 자녀가 외국에서 출생했어도 자녀가 미국 시민일 수 있고 이 테스트 요건을 충족할 수 있습니다.
**외국인 학생의 거주지.**
적격 국제 교육 교류 프로그램에 따라 이 나라에 입국하여 일시적 기간 동안 미국 가정에서 생활하는 외국인 학생은 일반적으로 미국 거주자가 아니며 이 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않습니다. 이들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 단, 외국인 학생을 위해 숙식을 제공했을 경우, 자선 기부금 공제를 받을 수도 있습니다. 간행물 526에 나와 있는 _귀하와 함께 사는 학생을 위해 지불한 비용_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**미국 국민.**
미국 국민은 미국 시민은 아니지만 미국에 대한 충성의 의무가 있는 개인을 말합니다. 미국 국민에는 미국 영토 사모아 및 미국 시민 대신 미국 국민이 되기로 선택한 북마리아나 제도인이 포함됩니다. 
#### 적격 자녀
자녀가 귀하의 적격 자녀이기 위해서는 다섯 가지 테스트 요건을 충족해야 합니다. 다섯 가지 테스트는 다음과 같습니다.
  1. [관계](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170877 "관계 테스트"),
  2. [나이](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170883 "나이 테스트"),

다섯 가지 테스트는 다음 부분에서 설명합니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_어느 한 자녀가 1명 이상의 사람에 대한 적격 자녀가 되기 위한 다섯 가지 테스트 요건을 충족할 경우, 둘 중 어느 사람이 해당 자녀를 실제로 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있는지 판별하기 위한 규칙이 존재합니다. 뒤에서 다룰_[1명 이상의 사람에 대한 적격 자녀](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000204278 "한 사람 이상에 대한 적격 자녀") _를 참조하십시오._.

  * 나이와 상관 없이 영구적이며 완전한 장애가 있다.


**예시.**
귀하의 자녀는 12월 10일에 만 19세가 되었습니다. 이 자녀가 영구적이며 완전한 장애인이거나 학생이 아닌 이상, 이 자녀는 해당 연도 말 기준 만 19세 **미만** 이 아니었기 때문에 나이 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않습니다.
**자녀는 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자보다 어려야 합니다.**
귀하의 적격 자녀가 되기 위해서는 영구적이며 완전한 장애인이 아닌 이상 귀하보다 나이가 어려야 합니다. 단, 귀하가 부부 공동 신고를 할 경우, 자녀는 귀하나 귀하의 배우자보다 어려야 하지만 양쪽 모두보다 어려야 하지는 않습니다.
**예시 1—귀하나 귀하의 배우자보다 어리지 않은 자녀.**
학생이고 미혼인 귀하의 만 23세 형제 또는 자매는 귀하와 귀하의 배우자와 함께 살고 있으며, 귀하 부부가 그의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담합니다. 그 사람에게는 장애가 있지 않습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 만 21세이고 공동 신고서 제출을 합니다. 귀하의 형제 또는 자매는 귀하 또는 귀하의 배우자보다 어리지 않기 때문에 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**예시 2— 귀하의 배우자보다 어리지만 귀하보다 어리지 않은 자녀.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하의 배우자는 만 25세입니다. 귀하의 형제 또는 자매는 귀하의 배우자보다 어리고, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 신고서 제출을 하기 때문에 귀하의 형제 또는 자매가 귀하보다 어리지 않아도 그는 귀하의 적격 자녀입니다.

양육권이 있는 부모는 해당 연도 중에 해당 자녀가 더 많은 밤 동안 함께 산 부모에 해당합니다. 자녀의 다른 부모는 양육권이 없는 부모에 해당합니다.
해당 연도 중에 부모가 이혼 또는 별거하였고 별거 전에 자녀가 양쪽 부모와 함께 살았다면, 양육권이 있는 부모는 해당 연도의 나머지 기간 동안 자녀가 더 많은 밤 동안 함께 산 부모에 해당합니다.
다음에 해당할 경우, 해당 자녀는 밤 동안 해당 부모와 함께 산 것으로 취급됩니다.
  * 해당 부모가 가정에 있었는지 여부와는 상관 없이 자녀가 해당 부모의 가정에서 잠을 청하였다. 또는

_**동일한 수의 밤.**_
해당 연도 동안 자녀가 양쪽 부모와 동일한 수의 밤을 함께 산 경우, 양육권이 있는 부모는 AGI가 높은 부모입니다.
_**12월 31일.**_
12월 31일의 밤은 밤이 시작된 동일한 연도의 일부로 취급됩니다. 예를 들어, 2024년 12월 31일의 밤은 2024년의 일부로 취급됩니다.
_**독립한 자녀.**_
주 법에 따라 독립한 자녀는 양쪽 부모 누구와도 함께 살지 않는 것으로 취급됩니다. _예시_ [_5_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000230142 "예시 5—5월에 독립한 자녀.")와 [_6_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000230143 "예시 6—8월에 독립한 자녀.")을 참조하십시오.
_**부재.**_
자녀가 (예를 들어, 친구 집에서 자고 오느라) 특정 밤에 부모 양쪽 누구와도 함께 있지 않은 경우, 해당 자녀는 해당 부재가 아니었으면 밤 동안 원래 함께 살았을 부모와 그날 밤 함께 산 것으로 취급됩니다. 단, 자녀가 그날 밤 원래 어느 부모와 함께 살았을지 판단하기 어렵거나 양쪽 부모 누구와도 함께 살지 않았을 것인 경우, 해당 자녀는 그날 밤 양쪽 부모 누구와도 함께 살지 않은 것으로 취급됩니다.
_**밤에 일하는 부모.**_
부모의 야간 근무 시간 때문에 야간에 일하는 부모와 더 많은 낮을 함께 살았지만 밤은 그렇지 않은 경우, 이 부모가 양육권이 있는 부모로 취급됩니다. 등교일에는 자녀가 학교에 등록된 주거주지에 사는 것으로 취급됩니다.
**예시 1—자녀가 한쪽 부모와 더 많은 수의 밤을 함께 산 경우.**
귀하와 자녀의 다른 부모는 이혼을 했습니다. 2024년에 귀하의 자녀는 귀하와 함께 210 밤을 함께 살았고, 다른 부모와는 156 밤을 함께 살았습니다. 양육권이 있는 부모는 귀하입니다.
**예시 2—자녀가 캠프에 떠난 경우.**
2024년, 귀하의 자녀는 양쪽 부모와 격주로 함께 삽니다. 여름에 귀하의 자녀를 6주간을 여름 캠프에서 보냅니다. 이 6주 동안, 자녀는 3주 동안은 귀하와 살고 나머지 3주 동안은 귀하의 전 배우자와 사는 것으로 취급합니다. 그 이유는 해당 기간이 이 자녀가 여름 캠프에 가지 않았다면 각 부모와 함께 살았을 기간에 해당하기 때문입니다.
**예시 3—자녀가 동일한 수의 밤을 각 부모와 함께 살았을 경우.**
귀하의 자녀는 해당 연도 중 귀하와 180 밤을 함께 살았고 자녀의 다른 부모인 귀하의 전 배우자와도 동일한 수의 밤을 함께 살았습니다. 귀하의 AGI는 $40,000입니다. 귀하의 전 배우자의 AGI는 $25,000입니다. 귀하의 AGI가 더 높기 때문에 귀하가 자녀의 양육권이 있는 부모로 취급됩니다.

귀하의 자녀가 주중에는 귀하와 함께 살고, 격주 주말에는 귀하의 전 배우자와 함께 삽니다. 그런데 귀하가 아파서 병원에 입원하게 됩니다. 귀하가 병원에 있는 동안 전배우자가 귀하의 가정에서 귀하의 자녀가 10일 연속 함께 삽니다. 귀하의 자녀가 귀하의 가정에서 살았기 때문에 이 자녀는 10일 기간 동안 귀하와 함께 산 것으로 취급됩니다.
**예시 5—5월에 독립한 자녀.**
귀하의 자녀가 2024년 5월에 만 18세가 되자, 자녀가 사는 주 법에 따라 독립한 것이 됐습니다. 이에 따라 자녀는 해당 연도 절반 이상 동안 두 부모의 양육권 하에 놓이지 않은 것으로 간주합니다. 이혼하거나 별거한 부모의 자녀에 대한 특별 규칙이 자녀에게는 적용되지 않습니다.
**예시 6—8월에 독립한 자녀.**
귀하의 자녀는 2024년 1월 1일부터 2024년 5월 31까지 귀하와 함께 살고,자녀의 다른 부모인 귀하의 전 배우자와 2024년 6월 1일부터 연말까지 함께 삽니다. 귀하의 자녀는 만 18세가 되어 주 법에 따라 2024년 8월 1일에 독립하게 됩니다. 귀하의 자녀는 8월 1일부터는 양쪽 부모 누구와도 함께 살지 않는 것으로 취급되기 때문에, 귀하의 자녀는 2024년에 귀하와 더 많은 밤을 함께 산 것으로 취급됩니다. 양육권이 있는 부모는 귀하입니다.
_**서면으로 작성한 선언.**_
양육권이 있는 부모는 자녀 면제 청구를 해제한다는 내용의 서면으로 작성한 선언을 양육권이 없는 부모에게 전달하기 위해서 양식 8332 또는 이와 유사한 (해당 양식에서 요구하는 동일한 정보를 담은) 진술서를 사용해야 합니다. 과세 연도 2024년에 대한 면제 금액은 0이지만, 해제를 통해 자녀 세액공제, 추가 자녀 세액공제, 다른 부양 가족에 대한 세액공제가 적용 가능한 경우, 양육권이 없는 부모는 해당 자녀에 대해 이를 청구할 수 있습니다. 양육권이 없는 부모는 해당 양식 또는 진술서 사본을 자신의 세금 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다.
이 해제는 진술서에 명시된 바에 따라 1년 동안 유효할 수도 있고, 지정한 연도 (예를 들어, 격년) 또는 향후 모든 연도에 대해 유효할 수도 있습니다.

귀하는 귀하의 만 16세 자녀의 해당 연도에 대한 부양 비용으로 $4,000를 부담하였으며 귀하의 자녀는 $6,000를 부담하였습니다. 귀하의 자녀는 해당 연도에 대해 자신의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하였습니다. 귀하의 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**위탁 가정 지급액 및 비용.**
입양 기관에서 위탁 아동의 부양을 위해 귀하에게 지급한 금액은 임양 기관에서 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주합니다. 이와 유사하게 주 또는 군에서 위탁 아동의 부양을 위해 귀하에게 지급한 금액은 주 또는 군에서 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주합니다.
위탁 아동를 돌보는 데 지출한, 변제 받지 않은 기타 비용이 주로 공제 가능한 자선 기부금을 수령할 수 있는 단체에 도움을 주기 위함이었으며 귀하가 가정 위탁 사업 또는 사업을 운영하지 않는 경우, 이러한 비용은 자선 기부금으로 공제 가능하지만 귀하가 부담한 부양 비용으로는 간주되지 않습니다. 자선 기부금을 위한 공제에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 526을 참조하십시오. 귀하의 변제 받지 않은 비용이 자선 기부금으로서 공제 가능하지 않을 경우, 귀하가 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주될 수도 있습니다. 
위탁 가정 사업 또는 사업을 운영하는 경우, 귀하의 변제 받지 않은 비용은 귀하가 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주되지 않습니다.
**예시 1.**
위탁 아동은 해당 연도의 마지막 3개월 동안 결혼한 커플인 스미스 부부와 함께 살았습니다. 스미스가는 위탁 아동의 입양을 위해 위탁되지 않았음에도) 위탁 아동을 입양하고 싶었기 때문에 이 아동을 돌보았습니다. 그들은 사업 또는 사업의 일환으로 아동을 돌보지 않았으며 그들의 가정에 아동을 위탁한 입양 기관이 이익을 취할 수 있도록 위탁 아동을 돌본 것도 아니었습니다. 스미스가의 변제 받지 않은 비용은 자선 기부금으로 공제 가능하지는 않지만 그들이 위탁 아동을 위해 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주합니다. 
**예시 2.**
귀하는 귀하의 만 10세 위탁 아동의 해당 연도에 대한 부양 비용으로 $3,000를 부담하였습니다. 주 정부는 $4,000를 부담하였습니다. 이는 자녀가 부담한 부양 비용이 아닌 주 정부가 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_주 정부에서 부담한 부양 비용 (복지, 푸드 스탬프, 숙박 등)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170982 "주 정부에서 제공한 부양 비용 \(복지, 푸드 스탬프, 숙박 등\).")을 참조하십시오. 귀하의 위탁 아동는 해당 연도에 대해 자신의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않았습니다.
**장학금.**
학생인 자녀가 수령한 장학금은 자녀가 자신의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하였는지 여부를 판별하는 데 고려 대상이 아닙니다.
#### (적격 자녀가 되기 위한) 공동 신고서 테스트
이 테스트 요건을 충족하기 위해서는 해당 자녀가 해당 연도에 대하여 공동 신고서 제출을 할 수 없습니다.
**예외.**
귀하의 자녀와 그의 배우자가 오직 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부한 추정세에 대한 환급 청구를 하기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 하였을 경우, 공동 신고서 테스트에 예외가 적용됩니다. 
**예시 1—자녀가 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
귀하는 귀하의 만 18세 자녀를 부양하였고 이 자녀의 배우자가 군 복무를 하는 동안 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 귀하의 자녀의 배우자는 해당 연도에 $35,000의 소득을 얻었습니다. 자녀 부부는 공동 신고서 제출을 했으며 이로 인해 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
**예시 2—자녀가 오직 원천징수된 세금에 대해 환급을 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
귀하의 만 18세 자녀와 이 자녀의 만 17세 배우자는 시간제 근로에 대한 임금으로 $800를 얻었고 다른 소득은 없었습니다. 자녀의 부부는 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 자녀와 자녀의 배우자 모두 세금 신고서를 제출할 의무가 없습니다. 그들에게는 자녀가 없습니다. 그들의 임금에서 세금이 공제되었기 때문에 그들은 오직 원천징수된 세금을 환급 받기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 하였습니다. 공동 세금 신고 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용되어 다른 테스트 요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하의 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있습니다.
**예시 3—자녀가 미국 시민 기회 세액공제를 청구하기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 한 경우.**
_예시 2_ 와 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 두 배우자의 임금에서 둘다 세금이 공제되지 않았습니다. 단, 그들은 $124의 미국 시민 기회 세액공제를 청구하여 해당 금액을 환급 받기 위해 공동 신고서 제출을 합니다. 미국 시민 기회 세액공제를 청구하는 공동 신고서를 제출했기 때문에 그들은 오직 소득세 원천징수 또는 추정세 납부에 대한 환급을 받기 위해 세금 신고서를 제출한 것이 아닙니다. 공동 신고서 테스트에 대한 예외가 적용되지 않아 귀하의 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다.
#### 한 사람 이상에 대한 적격 자녀
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 적격 자녀가 다른 누군가의 적격 자녀가 아닐 경우, 이 주제는 귀하에게 적용되지 않으므로 읽어보지 않아도 됩니다. 이는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 귀하와 공동 신고서 제출을 하는 배우자를 제외한 누군가의 적격 자녀가 아닌 경우에도 마찬가지입니다._.

때로는 자녀가 1명 이상에 대해 적격 자녀가 될 수 있는 관계, 나이, 거주지, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건들을 충족합니다. 해당 자녀는 두 사람 모두의 적격 자녀이지만, 일반적으로는 한 사람만 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급하여 다음과 같은 세금 혜택을 모두 제공 받을 수 있습니다 (단, 각 혜택을 받을 자격 조건을 갖추어야 합니다).
  1. 자녀 세액공제, 다른 부양 가족에 관한 세액공제 또는 추가 자녀 세액공제.
  2. 세대주 납세자 구분.
  3. 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용 세액공제.
  4. 소득에서 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제.
  5. 근로 소득 세액공제.


두 사람 중 다른 사람은 해당 적격 자녀에 기반한 이러한 혜택들을 전혀 제공 받을 수 없습니다. 달리 말해, 귀하와 다른 사람은 이 혜택을 서로 나눠 받기로 합의할 수 없습니다.
**타이브레이커 규칙.**
누가 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급하여 이 다섯 가지 세금 혜택을 청구할 수 있을지 판별하기 위해 다음 타이브레이커 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이 타이브레이커 규칙 목적상, “부모”라는 용어는 개인의 친부모 또는 양부모를 의미합니다. 양부모 또는 양부모가 해당 개인을 입양하지 않는 한 해당 부모는 포함되지 않습니다.
  * 둘 중 한 사람만 자녀의 부모일 경우, 해당 자녀는 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다.
  * 부모가 함께 공동 신고서 제출을 하고 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있는 경우, 해당 자녀는 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다.
  * 부모가 함께 공동 신고서 제출을 하지 않았는데 양쪽 모두 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 경우, IRS는 해당 자녀를 해당 연도 동안 더 오랫동안 함께 산 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급할 것입니다. 해당 자녀가 양쪽 부모와 동일한 기간을 함께 산 경우, IRS는 해당 자녀를 해당 연도에 대해 AGI가 더 높은 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급할 것입니다.
  * 양쪽 부모 모두 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없는 경우, 해당 자녀는 해당 연도에 대해 AGI가 가장 높은 사람의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다.
  * 부모가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있는데도 양쪽 부모 모두 그러지 않을 경우, 해당 자녀는 해당 연도에 대해 AGI가 가장 높은 사람의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다. 단, 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있는 양쪽 부모 중 AGI가 더 높은 부모의 AGI보다 그 사람의 AGI가 더 높아야 합니다.


이러한 타이브레이커 규칙을 전제로 하여 귀하와 다른 사람 중 누가 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 것인지 선택할 수도 있습니다.

**예시 1—부모 및 조부모와 함께 사는 자녀.**
귀하와 귀하의 만 3세 자녀 조단은 귀하의 부모와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 25세이고 미혼이며, 귀하의 AGI는 $9,000입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI는 $15,000입니다. 조단의 다른 부모는 귀하나 조단과 함께 살지 않았습니다. 귀하는 양식 8332 (또는 이와 유사한 진술서)에 서명을 하지 않았습니다.
조단은 귀하와 귀하의 부모에 대해 관계, 나이, 거주지, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건을 모두 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 귀하의 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 그러나 둘 중 한 명만 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 자녀는 조단의 다른 부모를 포함해, 다른 사람의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 귀하는 귀하의 부모가 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구하는 것을 승낙하였습니다. 이는 귀하의 부모가 앞에서 제시한 다섯 가지 세금 혜택 각각에 대하여 자격 요건을 갖춘 경우 (또한 귀하가 이 다섯 가지 세금 혜택에 대하여 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구하지 않을 경우), 이에 대해 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있음을 의미합니다.
**예시 2—부모의 AGI가 조부모의 AGI보다 높은 경우.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하의 AGI는 $18,000입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI가 귀하의 AGI보다 높지 않기 때문에 귀하의 부모는 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없습니다. 오직 귀하만 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 3—두 사람이 같은 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 경우.**
[_예시 1_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000204283 "예시 1—부모 및 조부모와 함께 사는 자녀.")과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하와 귀하의 부모 모두 조단을 적격 자녀로 청구합니다. 이러한 경우에는 오직 자녀의 부모인 귀하만이 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있게 됩니다. IRS는 귀하의 부모가 조단을 기반으로 앞서 제시한 다섯 가지 세금 혜택을 청구하는 것을 허용하지 않게 됩니다. 단, 귀하의 부모는 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자를 위한 근로 소득 세액공제를 받을 수도 있습니다.
**예시 4—적격 자녀들을 두 사람 사이에 나눌 수 있는 경우.**
[_예시 1_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000204283 "예시 1—부모 및 조부모와 함께 사는 자녀.")과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하에게는 귀하와 귀하의 어머니 모두에게 적격 자녀인 어린 자녀가 두 명 더 있습니다. 두 사람 중 한 사람만 각 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 단, 귀하의 어머니의 AGI가 귀하의 AGI보다 높을 경우, 귀하는 귀하의 어머니가 자녀를 한 명 이상 적격 자녀로 청구하는 것을 허용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 귀하가 자녀 한 명을 적격 자녀로 청구할 경우, 귀하의 어머니는 나머지 두 명을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 5—적격 자녀인 납세자.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하는 만 18세밖에 안 됐고 해당 연도에 대해 귀하의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않았습니다. 이는 귀하가 귀하의 부모의 적격 자녀임을 의미합니다. 귀하의 부모가 귀하를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있을 경우, 귀하는 앞서 설명한 [_부양 가족 납세자 테스트_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170865 "부양 가족 납세자 테스트") 때문에 귀하의 부모가 오직 원천징수된 소득세 또는 예납한 추정세의 환급 청구를 위해서만 세금 신고서를 제출한 것이 아니라면 귀하의 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 6—별거한 부모.**
귀하, 귀하의 배우자와 귀하의 만 10세 자녀는 귀하의 배우자가이 집을 나가기 전인 2024년 8월 1일까지 다 같이 미국에 살았습니다. 2024년 8월과 9월에는 귀하의 자녀는 귀하와 함께 살았습니다. 해당 연도의 나머지 기간 동안 귀하의 자녀는 귀하의 자녀의 다른 부모인 귀하의 배우자와 함께 살았습니다. 귀하의 자녀는 귀하 및 귀하의 배우자와 각각 해당 연도의 절반 이상을 함께 살았고 양쪽 모두에 대해 관계, 나이, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건을 충족했기 때문에 귀하와 귀하의 배우자 모두의 적격 자녀입니다. 연말까지 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 이혼하거나 법적으로 별거하거나 또는 서면으로 작성한 별거 합의서에 따라 별거하지 않았기 때문에 이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀를 위한 규칙이 적용되지 않습니다.
귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 개별 신고서 제출을 할 것입니다. 귀하의 배우자는 귀하가 귀하의 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있도록 승낙합니다. 이는 귀하의 배우자가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구하지 않을 경우, 귀하가 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구하여 (자격 조건을 갖춘 경우) 자녀 세액공제 및 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제를 받을 수 있음을 의미합니다. 단, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 해당 연도의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았기 때문에 귀하는 세대주 납세자 구분을 신청할 수 없습니다. 따라서 귀하의 납세자 구분은 부부 개별 신고이며 귀하는 근로 소득 세액공제를 신청하기 위해 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 특정 별거한 배우자에 대한 요구사항에 부합하지 못하기 때문에 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 말에 따로 살았지만, 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았고, 서면으로 작성한 별거 합의서 또는 별거 생활 유지 판결문에 따라 별거하지 않았습니다. 따라서 귀하는 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않는 별거한 배우자로서 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 요구사항에 부합하지 않습니다. 또한 귀하의 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 신고이며 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았기 때문에 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용에 대한 공제도 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 7—별거한 부모가 같은 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 경우.**
_예시 6_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하와 귀하의 배우자 모두 귀하의 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구합니다. 이러한 경우, 오직 귀하의 배우자만 귀하의 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 그 이유는 2024년에 자녀가 귀하보다 귀하의 배우자와 더 오래 살았기 때문입니다. 귀하가 귀하의 자녀에 대해 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 경우, IRS는 귀하의 자녀 세액공제에 대한 청구를 허용하지 않을 것입니다. 귀하에게 다른 적격 자녀나 부양 가족이 없을 경우, IRS는 부양 가족 보육 혜택에 관한 귀하의 면제 청구 또한 허용하지 않을 것입니다. 또한, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 해당 연도의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았기 때문에 귀하의 배우자는 세대주 납세자 구분을 신청할 수 없습니다. 따라서 귀하의 배우자의 납세자 구분은 부부 개별 신고입니다. 귀하의 배우자는 특정 별거한 배우자가 근로소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 있는 요구사항에 부합하지 않기 때문에 귀하의 배우자는 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년 마지막날에는 따로 살았지만 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았고, 서면으로 작성한 별거 합의서 또는 별거 생활 유지 판결문에 따라 별거하지 않았습니다. 이에 따라, 귀하의 배우자는 공동 신고서를 제출하는 별거하는 배우자로서 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 요건에 부합하지 않습니다. 또한 귀하의 배우자의 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 신고이며 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년의 마지막 6개월 동안 따로 살지 않았기 때문에 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용에 대한 세액공제도 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 8—혼인하지 않은 부모.**
귀하, 귀하의 만 5세 자녀 말리와 말리의 다른 부모는 해당 연도 내내 미국에서 함께 살았습니다. 귀하와 말리의 다른 부모는 혼인하지 않았습니다. 말리는 귀하와 그의 다른 부모에 대해 관계, 나이, 거주지, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건을 모두 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 말리의 다른 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 귀하의 AGI는 $12,000이고 말리의 다른 부모의 AGI는 $14,000입니다. 말리의 다른 부모는 귀하가 말리를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있도록 승낙합니다. 이는 귀하가 자격 조건을 갖춘 경우 (또한 말리의 다른 부모가 세금 혜택을 위해 귀하의 아들을 적격 자녀로 청구하지 않는 경우), 자녀 세액공제, 세대주 납세자 구분, 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용 세액공제, 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제, 및 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해 말리를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있음을 의미합니다.
**예시 9—혼인하지 않은 부모가 같은 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 경우.**
_예시 8_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하와 말리의 다른 부모 둘다 모두 말리를 적격 자녀로 청구합니다. 이러한 경우, 오직 말리의 다른 부모만이 말리를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있습니다. 말리의 다른 부모의 AGI인 $14,000가 귀하의 AGI인 $12,000보다 높기 때문입니다. 귀하가 말리에 대해 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 경우, IRS는 이 세액공제에 대한 귀하의 청구를 허용하지 않을 것입니다. 귀하에게 다른 적격 자녀나 부양 가족이 없을 경우, IRS는 세대주 납세자 구분과 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용 세액공제 청구, 및 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제 또한 허용하지 않을 것입니다. 귀하는 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자로서 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수도 있습니다.
**예시 10—자녀가 부모와 함께 살지 않은 경우.**
귀하와 형제 또는 자매의 자녀인 만 7세 리드는 귀하의 부모와 해당 연도 내내 함께 살았습니다. 귀하는 만 25세이고, 귀하의 AGI는 $9,300입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI는 $15,000입니다. 리드의 부모는 공동 세금 신고를 하며, AGI가 $9,000 미만이고, 귀하나 그들의 자녀와 함께 살지 않습니다. 리드는 귀하와 귀하의 부모에 대해 관계, 나이, 거주지, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건을 모두 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 귀하의 부모의 적격 자녀입니다. 단, 오직 귀하의 부모만 리드를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 이는 귀하의 부모의 AGI인 $15,000가 귀하의 AGI인 $9,300보다 높기 때문입니다.
**이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모에게 타이브레이커 규칙 적용하기.**
앞서 설명한 [이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170897 "이혼하거나 별거한 \(또는 따로 생활하는\) 부모의 자녀.")를 위한 규칙에 따라 자녀가 양육권이 없는 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급될 경우, 오직 양육권이 없는 부모만 해당 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있으며 해당 자녀에 대해 자녀 세액공제, 추가 자녀 세액공제나 다른 부양 가족에 관한 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 단, 오직 양육권이 있는 부모만 해당 자녀에 대해 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용 세액공제 또는 부양 가족 보육 혜택 제외를 청구할 수 있습니다. 또한, 양육권이 없는 부모는 세대주 납세자 구분 또는 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 신청할 수 없습니다. 대신, 자격을 갖춘 경우, 양육권이 있는 부모 또는 다른 사람이 이 두 가지 혜택을 위해 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 해당 자녀가 이러한 혜택에 대해 1명 이상의 적격 자녀일 경우, 앞서 설명한 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 양육권이 있는 부모와 자격을 갖춘 다른 사람 중 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀로 취급할 수 있는 사람이 정해집니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하와 귀하의 만 5세 자녀 코디는 귀하의 부모와 해당 연도 내내 미국에서 함께 살았습니다. 귀하의 부모는 가계 유지 비용을 전부 부담했습니다. 귀하의 AGI는 $10,000입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI는 $25,000입니다. 코디의 다른 부모는 미국에 일년 내내 살았지만 귀하나 코디와 함께 살지는 않았습니다.
앞서 설명한 이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀를 위한 규칙에 따라 코디는 이 자녀에 대한 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 수 있는 코디의 다른 부모의 적격 자녀로 취급됩니다. 따라서 귀하는 이 자녀에 대해 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 그러나 이 규칙에 따라 코디의 다른 부모가 세대주 납세자 구분, 자녀 및 부양 가족 케어 비용 세액공제, 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제, 또는 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해 코디를 적격 자녀로 신청할 수 있게 허용하는 것은 아닙니다.
귀하와 귀하의 부모에게는 자녀양육 비용이나 부양 가족 보육 혜택이 없었으므로, 두 사람 모두 자녀 양육 비용 공제나 부양 가족 보육 혜택 관련 면제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 단, 코디는 귀하와 귀하의 부모에 대해 관계, 나이, 거주지, 부양, 및 공동 신고서 테스트 요건을 충족하기 때문에 귀하와 귀하의 부모가 세대주 납세자 구분 및 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 있는 적격 자녀입니다. (근로 소득 세액공제에는 부양 비용 테스트가 적용되지 않습니다.) 귀하는 부모가 코디를 적격 자녀로 청구하는 것을 승낙하였습니다. 이는 귀하의 부모가 세대주 납세자 구분 및 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 자격을 갖추었고 귀하가 귀하의 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해 코디를 적격 자녀로 청구하지 않을 경우, 귀하의 부모가 이를 청구할 수 있음을 의미합니다. (귀하의 부모가 가계 유지 비용 전체를 부담하였기 때문에 귀하는 세대주 납세자 구분을 청구할 수 없습니다.) 귀하는 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자를 위한 근로 소득 세액공제를 받을 수도 있습니다.
**예시 2.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하의 AGI는 $25,000이고 귀하의 부모의 AGI는 $21,000입니다. 귀하의 부모의 AGI가 귀하의 AGI보다 높지 않기 때문에 귀하의 부모는 어떤 목적으로도 코디를 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 3.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하와 귀하의 부모 모두 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해 코디를 적격 자녀로 청구합니다. 또한 귀하의 부모는 세대주 납세자 구분을 위해서도 코디를 적격 자녀로 청구합니다. 근로 소득 세액공제를 위해서는 오직 자녀의 부모인 귀하만이 아들을 적격 자녀로 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 부모에게 다른 적격 자녀 또는 부양 가족이 있지 않은 이상 IRS는 세대주 납세자 구분에 대한 귀하의 부모의 청구를 허용하지 않을 것입니다. 귀하의 부모는 AGI가 $18,591 이상이기 때문에 적격 자녀가 없는 납세자를 위한 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
#### 적격 친척
귀하의 적격 친척이 되기 위해서는 네 가지 테스트 요건을 충족해야 합니다. 네 가지 테스트는 다음과 같습니다.
  1. [적격 자녀가 아닌 자녀 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170936 "적격 자녀가 아님 테스트"),
  2. [가족 구성원 또는 관계 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170948 "가족 구성원 또는 관계 테스트"),
  3. [총 소득 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170962 "총소득 테스트"), 및
  4. [부양 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170967 "\(적격 친척이 되기 위한\) 부양 테스트").


**나이.**
적격 자녀와는 달리, 적격 친척은 어느 나이나 될 수 있습니다. 적격 친척에 대해서는 나이 테스트가 없습니다.
**납치된 자녀.**
자녀가 납치되었어도 해당 자녀를 적격 친척으로 취급할 수도 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 501을 참조하십시오.
#### 적격 자녀가 아님 테스트
해당 자녀가 귀하의 적격 자녀이거나 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀일 경우, 해당 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 아닙니다.
**예시 1.**
학생인 귀하의 만 22세 자녀는 귀하와 함께 살며 귀하의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있는 테스트 요건을 모두 충족합니다. 따라서 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 아닙니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하의 만 2세 자녀는 귀하의 부모와 함께 살고 그들의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있는 테스트 요건을 모두 충족합니다. 따라서 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 아닙니다.
**예시 3.**
귀하의 만 30세 자녀는 귀하와 함께 살지만 나이 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않아 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 총소득 테스트와 부양 비용 테스트 요건을 충족할 경우, 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있습니다.
**예시 4.**
귀하의 만 13세 손주는 해당 연도 동안 귀하와 함께 5개월을 살았습니다. 귀하의 손주는 거주자 자격 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않기 때문에 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 총소득 테스트와 부양 비용 테스트요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하의 손주는 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있습니다.
**신고서를 제출할 필요가 없는 사람의 자녀.**
해당 자녀가 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 아니고, 자녀의 부모 (또는 해당 자녀를 적격 자녀라고 부를 수 있는 다른 사람)가 소득세 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 되고 다음 중 하나에 해당할 경우, 해당 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있습니다.
  * 소득세 신고서를 제출하지 않거나, 또는
  * 오직 원천징수된 소득세 또는 납부한 추정세에 대해 환급을 받기 위해 신고서를 제출하는 경우.


**예시 1—신고서를 제출하지 않아도 되는 경우.**
귀하는 해당 연도 내내 귀하의 가정에서 귀하와 함께 산 친척이 아닌 친구와 친구의 만 3세 자녀를 부양합니다. 귀하의 친구는 총소득이 없고, 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없으며, 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않습니다. 부양 비용 테스트요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하의 친구와 친구의 자녀는 모두 귀하의 적격 친척입니다.
**예시 2—환급을 청구하기 위해 신고서를 제출한 경우.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하의 친구가 해당 연도 동안 $1,500의 임금을 벌었고 임금에서 원천징수된 소득세가 있습니다. 귀하의 친구는 오직 원천징수된 소득세를 환급 받기 위해 신고서를 제출하고 근로 소득 세액공제를 비롯한 다른 세액공제나 세금 공제는 청구하지 않습니다. 부양 비용 테스트요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하의 친구와 친구의 자녀는 모두 귀하의 적격 친척입니다.
**예시 3—근로 소득 세액공제를 청구한 경우.**
_예시 2_ 와 상황은 동일하지만, 다만 귀하의 친구가 해당 연도 동안 $8,000의 임금을 벌었고 근로 소득 세액공제를 청구하였습니다. 친구의 자녀는 다른 납세자 (귀하의 친구)의 적격 자녀이므로, 귀하가 친구의 자녀를 귀하의 적격 친척으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 또한, 앞서 설명한 총소득 테스트 요건 때문에 귀하는 귀하의 친구를 적격 친척으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**캐나다 또는 멕시코에 있는 자녀.**
귀하의 자녀가 캐나다나 멕시코에 살아도 해당 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수도 있습니다. 해당 자녀가 귀하와 함께 살지 않을 경우, 해당 자녀는 귀하의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있는 거주자 자격 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않습니다. 그러나 해당 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수도 있습니다. 해당 자녀가 함께 사는 사람이 미국 시민이 아니고 미국 총소득이 있지 않을 경우, 해당 사람은 “납세자”가 아니므로, 해당 자녀는 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 해당 자녀가 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀가 아닐 경우, 총소득 테스트 및 부양 테스트 요건을 충족하는 한 해당 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척입니다.
자녀가 미국 시민, 미국 영주권, 또는 미국인이 아닌 한 캐나다나 멕시코 이외의 외국 국가에 사는 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 함께 산 특정 입양아에 대해서는 예외가 있습니다. 앞서 다룬 [_시민 또는 거주자 자격 테스트_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170870 "시민 또는 거주자 테스트")를 참조하십시오.
**예시.**
귀하는 귀하의 부모와 멕시코에서 살고 소득이 없는 만 6세, 8세, 12세 자녀들을 전적으로 부양합니다. 귀하는 미혼이고 미국에 삽니다. 귀하의 부모는 미국 시민이 아니고 미국 소득이 없기 때문에 “납세자”가 아닙니다. 귀하의 자녀들은 거주자 자격 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않기 때문에 귀하의 적격 자녀들이 아닙니다. 그러나 그들이 다른 납세자의 적격 자녀들이 아니기 때문에 그들은 귀하의 적격 친척일 수도 있으며 귀하는 그들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있을수도 있습니다. 귀하는 또한 총소득 및 부양 비용 테스트요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하의 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수도 있습니다.
#### 가족 구성원 또는 관계 테스트
이 테스트 요건을 충족하기 위해서는 해당 개인이 다음 중 하나에 해당해야 합니다.
  1. 귀하와 해당 연도 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로 함께 산다, 또는
  2. 귀하와 아래에 다룰 [_귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 되는 친척_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170951 "귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 되는 친척.")에 제시된 친척 관계이다.


해당 연도 중에 해당 개인이 귀하의 배우자였던 적이 있을 경우, 해당 개인은 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 없습니다. 
**귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 되는 친척.**
귀하와 다음과 같은 관계인 사람은 해당 연도 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 이 테스트 요건을 충족합니다. 
  * 귀하의 자녀, 의붓 자녀 또는 위탁 아동, 또는 이들의 후손 (예를 들면, 귀하의 손주). (법적으로 입양된 자녀는 귀하의 자녀로 간주합니다.)
  * 귀하의 형제, 자매, 의복 형제, 의복 자매, 의붓 형제, 또는 의붓 자매.
  * 귀하의 아버지, 어머니, 조부모, 또는 기타 직계 조상. 단, 위탁 부모는 제외. 
  * 귀하의 의붓 아버지 또는 의붓 어머니.
  * 귀하의 형제 또는 자매의 아들이나 딸.
  * 귀하의 의복 형제 또는 의복 자매의 아들이나 딸.
  * 귀하의 아버지나 어머니의 형제나 자매.
  * 귀하의 사위, 며느리, 시아버지/장인, 시어머니/장모, 매부/처남/시숙 등, 시누이/올케/처제 등.


혼인을 통해 맺어진 이러한 관계는 죽음 또는 이혼에 의해 종료되지 않습니다.
**예시.**
2018년에 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 배우자의 미혼 부모인 지니를 부양하기 시작했습니다. 귀하의 배우자는 2023년에 사망하였습니다. 귀하의 배우자의 죽음에도 불구하고 지닌은 귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 계속해서 이 테스트 요건을 충족합니다. 총소득 테스트 및 부양 비용 테스트를 포함한 다른 모든 테스트 요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하는 지느를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
_**위탁 아동.**_
위탁 아동는 허가된 입양 기관이나 관할 법원의 판결, 법령 또는 기타 명령에 의해 귀하에게 위탁된 개인을 말합니다. 
**공동 신고서.**
공동 신고서 제출을 할 경우, 해당 개인은 귀하 또는 배우자 어느 한쪽과 친척 관계이면 됩니다. 또한, 해당 개인은 부양 비용을 부담하는 배우자와 친척 관계가 아니어도 됩니다.
예를 들어, 귀하는 귀하의 배우자의 양부모의 부양 비용의 반 이상을 제공합니다. 귀하의 배우자의 양부모는 귀하와 함께 살지 않아도 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 귀하와 배우자가 개별 신고서를 제출할 경우, 귀하의 배우자의 양부모는 연중 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 사는 경우에만 귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있습니다. 
**일시적 부재.**
다음과 같은 특수 상황으로 인해 귀하나 해당 개인이 일시적으로 부재한 기간에도 해당 개인은 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 산 것으로 간주합니다.
  * 질병,
  * 교육,
  * 사업,
  * 휴가,
  * 군복무, 또는
  * 소년원 생활.


해당 개인이 지속적인 치료를 받기 위해 요양원에 무기한 거주하는 동안에도 일시적 부재로 간주될 수도 있습니다. 
**사망 또는 출생.**
해당 연도에 사망했지만, 사망하기 전까지 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 산 개인은 이 테스트 요건을 충족할 것입니다. 해당 연도 중에 출생하고 해당 연도의 나머지 기간 동안 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 산 자녀도 마찬가지입니다. 자녀가 출생 이후에 필요에 의해 병원에 입원한 기간을 제외하고 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 산 경우에도 이 테스트 요건이 충족됩니다. 
귀하의 부양 가족이 해당 연도에 사망하였는데 그를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 다른 조건을 모두 충족할 경우, 귀하는 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시.**
귀하의 적격 친척이 될 수 있는 테스트 요건을 충족하는 귀하의 부모는 1월 15일에 사망하였습니다. 귀하의 부모를 신고서에서 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**지역 법에 저촉.**
해당 연도 중에 귀하와 해당 개인의 관계가 지역 법에 저촉될 경우, 해당 개인은 이 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않습니다. 
**예시.**
귀하의 연인은 연중 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 살았습니다. 그러나 귀하의 연인은 다른 사람과 혼인한 상태였기 때문에 귀하와 이 사람과의 관계는 귀하가 거주하는 주의 법에 저촉됩니다. 따라서 귀하의 연인은 이 테스트 요건을 충족하지 않으며 귀하는 이 사람을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**입양 자녀.**
입양 자녀는 언제나 귀하의 자녀로 간주됩니다. “입양 자녀”라는 용어는 법적 입양을 위해 귀하에게 법적으로 위탁된 자녀도 포함합니다. 
**사촌.**
귀하의 사촌은 반드시 연중 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 살아야만 이 테스트 요건을 충족합니다. 사촌은 귀하의 아버지나 어머니의 형제나 자매의 후손입니다. 
#### 총소득 테스트
이 테스트 요건을 충족하기 위해서는 해당 연도에 대한 해당 개인의 총소득이 $5,050 미만이어야 합니다.
**총소득의 정의.**
총소득은 현금, 재화, 부동산 및 서비스 형태로 받은 비과세 대상이 아닌 모든 소득입니다.
제조업, 상업, 또는 광업에서는 총소득이 총 순매출액에서 판매한 재화의 가격을 빼고 해당 사업에서 얻은 기타 소득을 더한 것입니다. 
임대 재산에서 얻은 총 소득은 총소득에 해당합니다. 임대 재산에서 얻은 총소득을 산정하는 데 세금, 수리비, 및 기타 비용을 공제하지 마십시오. 
총소득은 파트너쉽 (순익이 아닌) 총소득에서 파트너가 차지하는 지분을 포함합니다. 
총소득은 또한 모든 과세 대상 실업 보상, 과세 대상 사회 보장 혜택 및 특정 수령한 장학금과 연구비 보조금의 액수를 포함합니다. 특정 수업을 위한 수업료, 수수료, 물품, 책과 장비를 위해 사용된, 석사/박사 학위 후보자가 수령한 장학금은 일반적으로 총소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 자세한 정보는 [8장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171943 "기타 소득")을 참조하십시오. 
**장애자 보호 작업장에서 일하는 장애가 있는 부양 가족.**
총소득 테스트에 있어서 해당 연도 중에 영구적이며 완전한 장애가 있는 개인의 총소득에는 해당 개인이 장애자 보호 작업장에서 제공한 서비스를 대가로 얻은 소득은 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 개인이 장애자 보호 작업장에서 일한 주된 이유는 작업장을 통해 의료 서비스를 제공 받을 수 있기 때문이어야 합니다. 또한, 해당 소득은 오직 작업장을 통해 의료 서비스를 받기 위한 활동에서 발생해야 합니다.
“장애자 보호 작업장”은 다음과 같은 곳을 의미합니다.
  * 개인의 장애를 완화하기 위한 특별 교육 또는 훈련을 제공하는 곳. 또한
  * 특정 면세 기관 또는 주, 미국 영토, 주 또는 미국 영토의 행정구역, 미국, 또는 컬럼비아 특별지구에서 운영하는 곳.


[영구적이며 완전한 장애](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170890 "영구적 및 완전 장애.")는 앞서 다룬 _적격 자녀_ 아래에서 소개된 바와 같은 의미를 갖고 있습니다.
#### (적격 친척이 되기 위한) 부양 테스트
이 테스트 요건을 충족하기 위해서는 반드시 일반적으로 일반 연도 동안 해당 개인의 총 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 귀하가 부담해야 합니다.
단, 두 사람 이상이 부양 비용을 부담하는데, 이들 중 누구도 총 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않을 경우, 뒤에서 다룰 [_다중 부양 합의_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171011 "다중 부양 합의")를 참조하십시오.
**부양 테스트 충족 여부 판별하기.**
귀하가 해당 개인의 총 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담했는지 여부를 판별하기 위해서는 귀하가 해당 개인을 부양하는 데 기여한 금액과 해당 개인의 부양 비용을 부담한 모든 이들이 부담한 총 금액을 비교하면 됩니다. 여기에는 해당 개인이 자신의 자금에서 부담한 부양 비용도 포함됩니다. 
[워크시트 3-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171012 "워크시트 3-1. 부양을 판정하기 위한 워크시트")은 귀하가 어느 개인의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하였는지 판별할 때 유용하게 활용됩니다.
**본인의 자금이 부양 비용 부담에 사용되지 않은 경우.**
본인의 자금이 실제로 부양 비용을 부담하는 데 사용되지 않는 이상 이는 부양 비용에 해당하지 않습니다.
**예시.**
귀하의 부모는 $2,400를 사회 보장 혜택으로 수령하였고 $300를 이자로 수령하였으며 주택 비용으로 $2,000를 오락 비용으로 $400를 지불했으며, 그리고 $300를 저축 계좌에 입금하였습니다.
귀하의 부모가 수령한 총 금액은 $2,700 ($2,400 + $300)이지만, 귀하의 부모 자신의 부양 비용으로 지출한 금액은 $2,400 ($2,000 + $400)입니다. 귀하가 귀하의 부모의 부양 비용을 위해 $2,400 이상을 부담했고 귀하의 부모가 다른 부양 비용을 제공 받지 않은 경우, 귀하는 귀하의 부모의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담한 것입니다.
**자녀의 임금이 자신의 부양 비용을 위해 사용된 경우.**
해당 임금을 귀하가 자녀에게 지급하였어도 자녀의 임금으로 부담한 자녀의 부양 비용은 귀하가 기여한 것으로 포함시킬 수 없습니다. 
**부양을 제공한 연도.**
귀하가 나중 연도에 갚을 빌린 돈으로 해당 연도에 부양 비용을 부담하였어도, 귀하가 부양 비용을 지급한 연도가 귀하가 부양을 제공한 연도입니다. 
소득 신고에 회계 연도를 사용할 경우, 귀하의 회계 연도가 시작되는 일반 연도에 대해 부양 가족의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담해야 합니다. 
**군인의 부양 가족을 위한 수당.**
귀하가 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하는지 여부를 판별하는 데 정부가 기여한 수당 부분 및 귀하의 군인 연봉에서 부담한 부분 모두 귀하가 부담한 것으로 간주됩니다. 귀하의 수당이 귀하가 지명한 사람이 아닌 사람을 부양하는 데 사용된 경우, 이들이 다른 요건을 충족할 시 귀하는 이들을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다. 
**예시.**
귀하가 군인인 경우. 귀하가 생존 부모를 위해 할당금을 허가하고 귀하의 생존 부모는 이 할당금을 자신과 형제 또는 자매를 위해 사용합니다. 귀하가 할당금을 생존 부모에 대해서만 허가한 경우에도 귀하가 그들 각각의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하고 그들이 다른 요건을 충족할 경우, 귀하는 이 둘을 가각 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
_**비과세 대상 군부대 수당.**_
군부대 수당은 부양 비용을 산정하는 데 부양 가족 할당금과 동일한 방식으로 취급됩니다. 할당금과 비과세 대상 군부대 기본 수당은 모두 귀하가 부양 비용으로 부담한 것으로 간주합니다. 
**면세 소득.**
개인의 총 부양 비용을 산정하는 데 해당 개인을 부양하는 데 사용한 면세 소득, 저축금, 및 빌린 금액을 포함시키십시오. 면세 소득에는 특정 사회 보장 혜택, 복지 혜택, 비과세 생명보험 수익금, 군인 가족 할당금, 비과세 은퇴 연금, 및 비과세 이자가 포함됩니다. 
**예시 1.**
귀하는 해당 연도 동안 귀하의 부모의 부양 비용으로 $4,000를 제공하였습니다. 귀하의 부모는 $600의 근로 소득, $4,800의 비과세 사회 보장 혜택, 및 $200의 비과세 이자를 수령했으며 이 모든 금액을 자신의 부양 비용으로 사용했습니다. 귀하가 부담한 $4,000가 귀하의 부모의 총 부양 비용인 $9,600 ($4,000 + $600 + $4,800 + $200)의 절반 이상을 차지하지 않기 때문에 귀하는 귀하의 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하의 형제 혹은 자매는 $2,500의 학자금 대출을 받고 이를 대학 수업료를 납부하는 데 사용합니다. 이 사람은 학자금 대출에 대한 책임 부담을 직접 집니다. 귀하는 이 사람의 총 부양 비용 중 $2,000를 부담합니다. 귀하는 이 사람의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않기 때문에 이 사람을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
_**사회 보장 혜택.**_
기혼 부부가 부부 공동 명의로 발급된 수표를 혜택으로 지급 받을 경우, 달리 증명할 수 있지 않는 한, 총 지급액의 절반 금액이 한 배우자당 부양 비용으로 간주됩니다. 
자녀가 사회 보장 혜택을 수령하고 이를 자신의 부양 비용으로 사용할 경우, 해당 혜택은 자녀가 제공한 것으로 간주합니다. 
_**주 정부에서 제공한 부양 비용 (복지, 푸드 스탬프, 숙박 등).**_
빈곤한 개인에게 주 정부에서 제공한 혜택은 주 정부가 제공한 부양 비용으로 일반적으로 간주합니다. 단, 수령자의 필요에 따라 지급된 지불액 일부가 해당 목적을 위해 사용되지 않은 것으로 보이는 경우, 해당 개인의 부양 비용을 위해 전부 사용된 것으로 간주되지 않을 것입니다. 
**TANF 및 기타 정부 보조금.**
제안된 재무부 규정에 따라 TANF 지급금 또는 기타 유사한 보조금을 받고 그 보조금을 다른 사람을 지원하는 데 사용한 경우, 해당 보조금은 정부 또는 기타 제3자가 제공한 지원이 아닌 해당 개인에게 제공한 지원으로 간주됩니다.
**위탁 가정.**
입양 기관에서 위탁 아동의 부양을 위해 귀하에게 지급한 금액은 임양 기관에서 부담한 부양 비용으로 간주합니다. 앞서 다룬 [_가정 위탁 지불액 및 비용_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000252774 "위탁 가정 지급액 및 비용.")을 참조하십시오.
**양로원.**
친척의 수명이 다할 때까지 양로원에서 돌보도록 귀하가 일시 지불액을 지급하는데 지불액이 해당 친척의 기대 수명에 기반한 것일 경우, 각 연도에 귀하가 부담한 부양 비용은 일시 지불액을 친척의 기대 수명으로 나눈 금액입니다. 또한 귀하가 부담한 부양 비용에는 해당 연도 동안 귀하가 부담한 기타 비용이 포함됩니다. 
#### 총 부양 비용
귀하가 어느 개인의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하였는지 판별하기 위해서는 먼저 해당 개인의 총 부양 비용을 판별해야 합니다. 총 부양 비용에는 식품, 주택 , 의류, 교육, 의료 및 치과 치료, 오락, 교통, 및 기타 필수품을 제공하는 데 드는 금액을 포함합니다.
일반적으로, 한 부양 비용 항목에 대한 금액은 해당 항목을 제공하는 데 소요된 금액입니다. 숙박에 대한 부양 비용은 해당 주택의 공정 임대 가격에 해당합니다.
가족 구성원 한 명에게 직접적으로 관계되지 않은 가정의 식료품비는 가족 구성원들 사이에 나눠서 산정해야 합니다.
**예시 1.**
결혼한 이 커플은 그들의 두 자녀, 그리고 한명의 부모와 함께 삽니다. 이들의 부모는 $2,400의 사회 보장 혜택을 수령하고 이 부모는 의류비, 교통비, 및 오락비에 이를 사용합니다. 이 부모에게는 다른 소득이 없습니다. 결혼한 이 커플의 의 가정의 총 식료품비는 $5,200입니다. 그들은 부모의 의료비 및 약값으로 $1,200를 지출합니다. 부모를 위해 제공된 주택과 유사한 거주 시설의 가격을 토대로 한 부모가 사는 주택의 공정 임대 가격은 1년에 $1,800입니다. 다음과 같이 부모의 총 부양 비용을 산정하십시오.
주택의 공정 임대 가격 | $ 1,800  
---|---  
의류, 교통, 및 오락 | 2,400  
의료 비용 | 1,200  
G몫의 식료품 ($5,200의 1/5) | _1,040_  
**총 부양 비용** | $6,440  
결혼한 커플이 부담하는 $4,040 (주택 비용 $1,800 + 의료 비용 $1,200 + 식료품 비용 $1,040)는 부모의 총 부양 비용인 $6,440의 절반 이상입니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하의 부모 오브리와 배일리는 귀하와, 귀하의 배우자, 및 귀하의 두 자녀와 함께 귀하가 소유한 주택에 함께 삽니다. 귀하의 부모 몫의 주택 비용의 공정 임대 가격은 1년에 $2,000 (한 부모당 $1,000)이며 여기에는 가구 비용 및 공공 요금이 포함됩니다. 오브리는 $4,200를 비과세 은퇴 연금으로 수령하고, 이를 배일리와 자신을 위해 의류, 교통, 및 오락과 같은 부양 비용 항목을 제공하는 데 서로 동일한 금액을 지출하였습니다. 귀하 가정의 총 식료품비는 $6,000입니다. 귀하의 난방비 및 공공 요금은 $1,200에 달합니다. 배일리는 병원비 및 의료 비용으로 $600를 지출하고 귀하는 이를 해당 연도 중에 지급하였습니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 부모의 총 부양 비용을 산정하십시오.
_**부담한 부양 비용** _ | **오브리** | **배일리**  
---|---|---  
주택의 공정 임대 가격 | $1,000 | $1,000  
부양 비용으로 지출한 은퇴 연금 | 2,100 | 2,100  
부모 몫의 식료품 ($6,000의 1/6) | 1,000 | 1,000  
배일리의 의료 비용 |  | _600_  
**부모의 총 부양 비용** | $4,100 | $4,700  
부모 양쪽당 부양 비용 테스트를 따로 적용해야 합니다. 귀하는 오브리의 총 부양 비용인 $4,100 중 $2,000(주택 비용 $1,000 + 식료품비 $1,000), 즉 절반 이하를 부담합니다. 귀하는 배일리의 총 부양 비용인 $4,700 중 $2,600 (주택 비용 $1,000 + 식료품비 $1,000 + 의료 비용 $600), 즉 절반 이상을 부담합니다. 귀하는 배일리에 대해서는 부양 비용 테스트요건을 충족하지만, 오브리에 대해서는 그렇지 않습니다. 난방비 및 공공 요금은 공정 임대 가격에 포함되어 있으므로 이를 따로 산정하지 않습니다.
**숙박.**
한 개인에게 숙박을 제공할 경우, 귀하는 방, 아파트, 주택, 또는 사람이 사는 기타 주거 시설의 공정 임대 가격과 동일한 금액의 부양 비용을 제공하는 것으로 간주됩니다. 공정 임대 가격에는 가구 및 가전 제품에 대한 합리적인 사용 비용을 비롯한 난방비 및 기타 공공 요금을 포함합니다.
_**공정 임대 가격의 정의.**_
공정 임대 가격은 동일한 유형의 주택에 대하여 타인에게 받을 수 있을 것으로 합리적으로 기대할 수 있는 금액을 의미합니다. 이는 세금, 이자, 감가상각, 페인트, 보험료, 공공 요금, 가구 및 가전제품 비용과 같은 실제 비용을 대신하여 사용됩니다. 공정 임대 가격이 지급한 집세와 동일한 경우도 있습니다. 
귀하가 전체적인 숙박을 제공할 경우 귀하가 제공하는 부양 비용은 해당 개인이 사용하는 방의 공정 임대 가격이거나 해당 개인이 귀하의 주택 전체를 사용할 수 있을 경우, 전체 주택에서 해당 개인에 해당하는 몫의 공정 임대 가격입니다. 귀하가 전체적인 숙박을 제공하지 않을 경우, 공정 임대 가격을 귀하가 제공하는 숙박의 금액에 따라 나눠야 합니다. 귀하가 일부분만 부담하고 해당 개인이 나머지를 부담할 경우, 각자가 부담하는 금액에 따라 공정 임대 가격을 서로 나눠야 합니다. 
**예시.**
귀하의 부모는 귀하가 소유한 주택에 공짜로 삽니다. 가구가 갖추어진 해당 주택의 공정 임대 가격은 1년에 $5,400이고 여기에는 주택을 위한 공정 임대 가격인 $3,600와 가구를 위한 $1,800가 포함됩니다. 여기에는 난방비와 공과금은 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 주택은 귀하의 부모 소유인 가구로 완벽하게 채워졌습니다. 귀하는 그들의 공과금으로 $600를 지급합니다. 귀하의 부모가 사는 지역에서 공과금은 일반적으로 집세에 포함되지 않습니다. 따라서 귀하는 해당 주택의 공정 임대 가격을 $6,000 (가구를 포함하지 않은 해당 주택의 공정 임대 가격 $3,600 + 귀하의 부모가 제공한 가구에 대한 비용 $1,800 + 공공 요금 $600)로 간주하고 귀하는 그 중 $4,200 ($3,600 + $600)를 부담한 것으로 간주됩니다.
_**본인의 주택에 사는 개인.**_
개인이 소유한 주택의 공정 임대 가격은 해당 개인이 기여한 부양 비용으로 간주됩니다.
_**집세 없이 누군가와 함께 사는 경우.**_
귀하가 누군가의 집에서 집세를 내지 않은 채 함께 사는 경우, 해당 개인에 대해 귀하가 부담하는 부양 비용에서 그 사람이 제공하는 숙박의 공정 임대 가격을 빼야 합니다. 
**재산.**
부양 비용으로 제공된 자산은 공정 시장 가격에 의해 그 가치가 측정됩니다. 공정 시장 가격은 해당 자산이 개방된 시장에서 팔리는 가격을 의미합니다. 즉 사고자 하는 의지가 있는 소비자와 팔고자 하는 의지가 있는 판매자 모두 관련 사실 관계에 대해 적정 지식을 보유한 채 달리 행동할 의무가 없이 합의할 수 있는 가격을 말합니다. 
_**자산 비용.**_
누군가를 위해 해당 연도 중에 구입한 가구, 가전제품, 자동차와 같은 자본 항목은 특정 상황에 따라 총 부양 비용에 포함될 수 있습니다. 
다음 예시들은 자본 항목이 부양 비용에 포함될 수 있는 경우와 그렇지 않은 경우를 제시하고 있습니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하가 귀하의 만 13세 자녀를 위해 $200인 전기 잔디깍기를 구입합니다. 해당 자녀는 잔디를 깍는 일을 부여 받습니다. 잔디깍기는 모든 가족 구성원에게 도움이 되므로, 잔디깍기 비용을 자녀의 부양 비용에 포함시키지 마십시오.
**예시 2.**
귀하가 귀하의 만 12세 자녀를 위해 $150짜리 텔레비전을 구입합니다. 이 텔레비전은 자녀의 방에 둡니다. 귀하는 텔레비전의 가격을 자녀의 부양 비용에 포함시킬 수 있습니다.
**예시 3.**
귀하는 자동차를 사는 데 $5,000를 지불하고 귀하의 명의로 구입하였습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 만 17세 딸은 동일한 비율로 자동차를 사용합니다. 귀하가 자동차를 소유하고 딸이 사용하도록 한 것에 불과하기 때문에 자녀의 총 부양 비용에 자동차 가격을 포함시키지 마십시오. 단, 딸의 부양 비용에 딸을 위해 자동차를 운영한 데 따른 기타 비용은 포함시킬 수 있습니다.
**예시 4.**
귀하의 만 17세 자녀는 자신의 개인 자금을 이용하여 $4,500인 자동차를 구입합니다. 귀하는 자녀의 나머지 부양 비용인 $4,000를 부담합니다. 귀하의 자녀가 자동차를 구입했고 소유하기 때문에 자동차의 공정 시장 가격 ($4,500)이 그의 부양 비용에 포함돼야 합니다. 귀하의 자녀는 자신의 총 부양 비용인 $8,500 ($4,500 + $4,000)의 절반 이상을 부담하였기 때문에 귀하의 적격 자녀가 아닙니다. 귀하는 자녀의 총 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않았기 때문에 이 자녀는 귀하의 적격 친척이 아닙니다. 이 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
**의료 보험료.**
보충 메디케어 보장을 위한 보험료를 포함한 귀하가 납부하는 의료보험료는 귀하가 부담하는 부양 비용에 포함됩니다. 
_**의료보험 혜택.**_
기본 및 보충 메디케어 혜택을 포함한 의료보험 혜택은 부양 비용의 일부가 아닙니다. 
**GI 법에 따른 수업료 지불 및 수당.**
제대군인이 학교에 재학하는 동안 GI법에 따라 수령하는 수업료 및 수당은 총 부양 비용에 포함됩니다. 
**예시.**
해당 연도 중에 귀하의 자녀는 GI법에 따라 정부에서 $2,200를 지급 받습니다. 귀하의 자녀는 자신의 교육을 위해 이 금액을 사용합니다. 귀하는 자녀의 나머지 부양 비용인 $2,000를 부담합니다. GI 혜택이 총 부양 비용에 포함되기 때문에 귀하의 자녀의 총 부양 비용은 $4,200 ($2,200 + $2,000)입니다. 귀하는 자녀의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않았습니다.
**탁아 비용.**
누군가에게 자녀 및 부양 가족의 보육을 위해 돈을 지불할 경우, 이러한 지불액에 대해 공제를 청구하더라도 귀하는 귀하의 자녀 또는 장애가 있는 부양 가족의 부양 비용 중 귀하가 부담한 금액으로 이러한 지불액을 포함시킬 수 있습니다. 해당 공제에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 503을 참조하십시오.
**기타 부양 비용 항목.**
상황별 사실 관계에 따라 다른 항목들도 부양 비용으로 간주될 수 있습니다.
#### 총 부양 비용에 포함시키지 말 것
다음 항목은 총 부양 비용에 포함되지 않습니다.

  6. 사망자 및 부양 가족의 교육 지원 지불금을 수령한 자녀를 부양하는 데 사용된 사망자 및 부양 가족의 교육 지원 지불금.


#### 다중 부양 합의
때로는 누구도 한 개인의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하지 않습니다. 대신, 부양 비용 테스트가 아니었으면 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있었던 두 사람 이상이 함께 해당 개인의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담합니다.
이럴 경우, 두 사람 이상 중 해당 개인의 부양 비용의 10%를 초과하여 부담하는 사람 한 명만 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구하도록 합의할 수 있습니다. 다른 이들은 해당 연도에 대해 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구하지 않기로 합의하는 진술서에 서명해야 합니다. 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구하는 사람은 서명한 진술서들을 증빙서류로 보관해야 합니다. 해당 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구하는 사람은 그를 부양 가족으로 청구하지 않기로 합의한 사람들을 명시하는 다중 부양 선언을 자신의 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 이를 위해 양식 2120을 사용할 수 있습니다.
귀하는 다중 부양 합의에 따라 귀하와 친척 관계인 개인이나 해당 연도 내내 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 귀하와 함께 산 개인을 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하와 귀하의 형제자매들 샘, 바비와 대니는 해당 연도에 대해 부모의 부양 비용 전체를 부담합니다. 귀하가 45%, 샘이 35%, 그리고 바비와 대니가 10%를 각각 부담합니다. 귀하나 샘 둘 중 한명은 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있으며 청구하지 않는 사람은 반드시 해당 연도에 대해 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구하지 않기로 합의하는 진술서에 서명해야 합니다. 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구하는 사람은 양식 2120 또는 이와 유사한 선언을 자신의 신고서에 첨부해야 하며 다른 사람이 서명한 진술서를 증빙서류로 보관해야 합니다. 바비 또는 대니는 부양 비용의 10%를 초과하여 부담하지 않기 때문에, 이 둘 중 누구도 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없으며 진술서에 서명하지 않아도 됩니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하와 귀하의 형제자매는 해당 연도에 대해 부모의 부양 비용의 20%를 각각 부담합니다. 나머지 60%는 부모와 친척 관계가 아닌 두 사람이 동일하게 나눠서 부담합니다. 부모는 그들과 함께 살지 않습니다. 귀하의 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없는 사람들이 부모의 부양 비용의 절반 이상을 부담하기 때문에, 누구도 귀하의 부모를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다.
#### 이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀를 위한 부양 비용 테스트
대부분의 경우, 이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀는 부모 중 한 사람의 적격 자녀가 됩니다. 앞서 다룬 _적격 자녀_ 아래에서 소개된 [_이혼하거나 별거한 (또는 따로 생활하는) 부모의 자녀_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170897 "이혼하거나 별거한 \(또는 따로 생활하는\) 부모의 자녀.")를 참조하십시오. 단, 해당 자녀가 부모 중 한 사람의 적격 자녀가 될 수 있는 요건을 갖추지 못한 경우, 해당 자녀는 부모 중 한 사람의 적격 친척이 될 수도 있습니다. 귀하에게 적용되는 사안이라고 생각할 경우, 간행물 501을 참조하십시오.
#### 부양 가족의 사회 보장 번호 (SSN)
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 _부양 가족_ 섹션 아래에 기재한 모든 부양 가족의 SSN을 밝혀야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_부양 가족의 SSN이 요구될 때 이를 밝히지 못하거나 잘못된 SSN을 밝힐 경우, 특정 세금 혜택이 거부될 수 있습니다._.
**SSN 없음.**
귀하가 신고서에 부양 가족으로 청구할 것으로 예상하는 개인이 SSN을 보유하지 않은 경우, 귀하나 해당 개인이 사회 보장국 (SSA)에 양식 SS-5, 사회 복지 보장 카드 신청서를 제출하여 최대한 빨리 SSN을 신청하도록 합니다. 양식 SS-5는 [SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)에서 온라인으로 얻거나 지역 SSA 사무소에서 얻을 수 있습니다.
SSA가 필요한 모든 정보를 확보한 때부터 SSN을 얻는 데 보통 2주가 소요됩니다. 제출 기한까지 필요한 SSN을 갖추지 못한 경우, 양식 4868을 제출하여 제출 기한을 연장 받을 수 있습니다. 
_**2024년에 출생 및 사망.**_
귀하의 자녀가 2024년에 출생하고 사망하였으며 해당 자녀의 SSN을 보유하지 않은 경우, 자녀의 출생 증명서, 사망 증명서, 또는 병원 기록 사본을 대신 첨부할 수 있습니다. 자녀가 살아서 출생한 사실이 서류를 통해 증명되어야 합니다. 이렇게 할 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 _부양 가족_ 섹션 아래 (2)열에 “DIED” (사망함)를 기입하십시오. 
**SSN을 보유하지 않은 외국인 또는 입양아.**
귀하의 부양 가족이 SSN을 보유하지 않은 경우, SSN 대신 ITIN 또는 입양 납세자 식별 번호 (ATIN)를 기재해야 합니다.
_**외국인을 위한 납세자 식별 번호.**_
귀하의 부양 가족이 SSN을 보유하지 않으며 발급 받을 자격이 없는 거주 또는 비거주 외국인인 경우, 귀하의 부양 가족은 개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN)를 신청해야만 합니다. 신청 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 양식 W-7, IRS 개인 납세자 식별 번호 신청서를 참조하십시오. 
_**입양아를 위한 납세자 식별 번호.**_
공인 입양 기관에서 귀하에게 자녀를 위탁한 경우, 귀하는 해당 자녀를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수도 있습니다. 단, 해당 자녀를 위해 SSN 또는 ITIN을 얻을 수 없는 경우, 해당 자녀를 위해 IRS로부터 ATIN을 받아야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 양식 W-7A, ‘입양 수속 중의 납세자 식별 번호 신청서’를 참조하십시오. 
## 4. 세금 원천징수 및 추정세
## 2025년 새로운 소식
**2025년 세법 변동사항.** 급여에서 원천징수될 소득세 금액을 산정하거나 추정세를 산정할 때는 2025년부터 효력이 발생한 세법 변동사항을 확인해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 505, ‘세금 원천징수 및 추정세’를 참조하십시오.
## 알림
**고소득 납세자의 추정세 피난처.** 귀하의 2024년 조정총소득이 $150,000 (부부 개별 신고서를 제출 시 $75,000)를 초과한 경우, 2025년 예상 세액의 90%와 2024년 세금 신고서 상 세액의 110% 중 더 적은 금액을 납부해야 추정세 과징금이 부과되지 않습니다.
#### 소개
이 장에서는 연간 소득 발생 시 세금 납부 방법에 대해 설명합니다. 일반적으로 연방 소득세는 pay-as-you-go (지속적 납부)식으로 납부합니다. 지속적 납부에는 두 가지 유형이 있습니다.
  * 원천징수. 귀하가 직원인 경우, 고용주는 귀하의 급여에서 소득세를 원천징수하고 있을 것입니다. 연금, 보너스, 커미션, 도박 수익 등 기타 수입에서도 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 원천징수 금액은 귀하의 이름으로 IRS에 납부됩니다.
  * 추정세. 원천징수 방식으로 세금을 납부하지 않거나 과세 금액을 모두 납부하지 않은 경우에는 추정세를 납부해야 합니다. 자영업자는 일반적으로 추정세를 납부합니다. 또한, 배당금, 이자, 자본이득, 임대료, 사용료 등의 소득이 발생하는 경우에도 추정세를 납부해야 합니다. 추정세는 소득세뿐만 아니라 자영업세 및 대체 최저세 납부에도 활용됩니다.


이 장에서는 이러한 납부 방법을 설명합니다. 또한, 다음 사항에 대해서도 설명합니다.
  * 원천징수 및 추정세에 대한 공제. 2024년 소득세 신고 시 해당 연도에 급여, 임금, 연금 등에서 원천징수된 모든 소득세와 납부한 추정세를 공제받을 수 있습니다. 또한, 사회 보장 및 철도 은퇴 계획에서 과잉 원천징수된 금액도 공제받을 수 있습니다. 간행물 505를 참조하십시오.
  * 과소납부 과징금. 해당 연도에 원천징수나 추정세를 통해 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우 과징금을 내야 할 수 도 있습니다. 대부분의 경우 IRS에서 귀하가 납부할 과징금을 산정합니다. 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오.

또한, 이자, 배당금, 기타 지급금에 대한 예비 원천징수에 대해서도 설명합니다.
#### 임금 및 급여
직원이라면 대부분 급여에서 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 정기 급여, 보너스, 커미션, 휴가 수당이 모두 급여에 해당합니다. 비어카운터블 플랜에서 고용주가 변제한 사업 비용 또는 고용주가 지급한 기타 비용 수당도 급여에 해당합니다. 비 어카운터블 플랜에서 고용주가 변제한 사업 비용 및 고용주가 지급한 수당에 관한 자세한 정보는 [_추가 급여_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032361 "추가 급여")에서 확인하시기 바랍니다.
해당 연도 소득이 소득세를 납부하지 않아도 되는 범위에 해당하는 경우 원천징수가 면제됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_원천징수 면제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032356 "원천징수 면제")를 참조하십시오.
또한, 비현금 임금 및 원천징수 대상이 아닌 기타 임금에서 소득세를 원천징수하도록 고용주에게 요청할 수 있습니다. 고용주가 원천징수에 동의하지 않거나 정확한 과세 금액이 원천징수되지 않은 경우 추정세를 납부해야 하며, 이에 관해서는 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오.
**퇴역 군인.**
퇴역 군인의 퇴직금은 소득세 원천징수에 한해 정기 급여와 동일하게 취급하며, 그 외 다른 과세 목적과 관련해서는 은퇴 연금 또는 연금 소득으로 취급합니다. 
**가사 노동자**
귀하가 가사 노동자인 경우 고용주에게 급여에서 소득세를 원천징수하도록 요청할 수 있습니다. 가사 노동자란 일반 가정이나 대학 클럽 또는 남녀학생 사교 클럽 지부에서 가사일을 수행하는 직원을 말합니다.
귀하가 원하고 고용주가 동의할 경우에만 세금을 원천징수합니다. 충분한 소득세가 원천징수되지 않은 경우 추정세를 납부해야 하며, 이에 관해서는 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오.
**농업 근로자.**
일반적으로 농업 현장에서 받는 현금 급여 중 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 그 외에는 고용주가 다음 두 경우에 모두 해당할 때 소득세가 원천징수되지 않습니다. 
  * 고용주가 지불하는 현금 급여가 연간 $150 미만인 경우 
  * 고용주가 지불하는 농업 인건비 총액이 연간 $2,500 미만인 경우.


**차등 임금 지급.**
직원이 군복무를 위해 휴직 중인 경우, 일부 고용주는 군인 대상 급여와 일반인 대상 급여 간에 차이를 두지 않는 경우가 있습니다. 30일을 초과하는 기간 동안 군복무 중인 직원의 급여는 소득세 원천징수 대상이지만, 사회 보장, 메디케어, 또는 연방 실업 세법 (FUTA) 관련 세금 원천징수의 대상은 아닙니다. 임금 및 원천징수는 양식 W-2, 임금 및 세금 명세서 상에 신고됩니다.
#### 양식 W-4를 이용한 원천징수액 계산
정기 급여에서 원천징수할 소득세 금액은 다음 두 사항을 기준으로 결정됩니다.
  * 해당 급여 기간에 지급 받은 금액.
  * 고용주에게 제출한 양식 W-4 상의 정보.


양식 W-4에는 원천징수 산정 방법이 명시되어 있습니다. 2단계부터 4단계는 귀하에게 해당하는 내용을 작성합니다.
  * **1단계.** 납세자 구분을 비롯한 개인 정보를 작성합니다.
  * **2단계.** 한번에 직업이 여러 개거나 부부 공동 신고이고 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 둘다 일했을 경우 이 부분을 작성합니다.
  * **3단계.** 부양가족 및 기타 공제를 청구할 경우 이 부분을 작성합니다.
  * **4단계.** 기타 조정할 사항이 있는 경우 이 부분을 작성합니다. * 기타 소득 * 공제 * 추가 원천징수


#### 새 직장
새 직장이 생긴 경우 양식 W-4를 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 고용주는 해당 양식의 사본을 보관해야 합니다. 향후 기입 정보를 수정해야 할 경우, 새 양식에 작성해야 합니다.
해당 연도 중 일부 기간에만 일한 경우 (예를 들어, 해당 연도의 중간에 일을 시작한 경우), 과도한 금액이 원천징수될 수 있습니다. 과다 원천징수를 방지하려면 고용주가 연중 일부 방식을 이용하는 데 동의해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 505의 1장, _연중 일부 방식_ 을 참조하십시오.
**연금 소득이 있는 직원.**
은퇴 연금 또는 연금 소득이 있는데 새로 취업한 경우, 양식 W-4를 작성하여 새 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 이때, 은퇴 연금과 직장에서 받는 급여의 원천징수를 각각 별개로 구분할 수 있습니다. 
#### 원천징수 변경
연중에는 혼인 여부, 조정 사항, 공제, 세액공제 등 세금 신고서에 작성해야 하는 정보가 변경될 수 있습니다. 이 경우 원천징수 상태를 변경하려면 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다.
개인적 상황 변경으로 인하여 귀하가 신청할 권리가 있는 원천징수 금액을 감소시킨다면 상황 변경 후 10일 내에 귀하의 고용주에게 필수적으로 새로운 양식 W-4를 제공해야 합니다.
**2026년 원천징수 변경.**
2025년에 발생한 일로 인해 2026년 원천징수액 변경이 필요하다면, 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 2025년 12월 1일까지 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 정보 변경이 필요한 일이 2025년 12월에 발생하는 경우, 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 10일 내에 제출해야 합니다. 
#### 원천징수 확인
고용주에게 양식 W-4를 제출한 후에는 원천징수액이 너무 많거나 적지 않은지 확인할 수 있습니다. 원천징수액이 과다 또는 과소납부되고 있는 경우, 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해 원천징수 사항을 변경해야 합니다. 원천징수액이 귀하가 실제 체납 세금과 일치하도록 해야 합니다. 과소납부인 경우, 연말에 체납 상태가 되어 이자 또는 과징금을 내야 할 수 있습니다. 과다납부인 경우, 환급 받기 전까지 해당 금액을 사용할 수 없습니다. 언제든 신분이나 재무 상황에 변화가 발생하거나 납부할 세액에 영향을 미치는 법이 개정된 경우 원천징수 상태를 확인하시기 바랍니다.
### 비고.
이미 지나간 기간의 임금 및 급여에 대한 원천징수, 혹은 추정세 납부를 위해 고용주에게 해당 금액을 지불할 수 없습니다.
#### 양식 W-4 및 워크시트 작성하기
양식 W-4에는 귀하의 원천징수액을 산정할 수 있는 워크시트가 있습니다. 해당 워크시트는 개인 기록 용도입니다. 이 워크시트를 고용주에게 제출하지 마십시오.
**다중 직장 워크시트**
귀하가 한번에 하나 이상의 직장에서 얻은 소득이 있거나 부부 공동 신고를 하며 귀하와 귀하의 배우자 둘다 일하고 있는 경우, 양식 W-4의 다중 직장 워크시트를 작성하십시오. 
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 별도 세금 신고서를 제출할 계획인 경우, 각자의 소득, 조정 사항, 공제, 세액공제 등의 정보를 바탕으로 별도의 워크시트를 이용해 원천징수액을 산정하십시오. 
**공제 워크시트.**
항목별 공제를 적용하거나 특정 소득 조정을 청구하여 원천징수액을 줄이려면 양식 W-4의 공제 워크시트를 이용하십시오. 해당 항목에 기입할 정보가 변경되었을 경우에 또한 이 워크시트를 작성하여 원천징수액을 변경해야 하는지 확인하시기 바랍니다. 
#### 정확한 원천징수액 설정
대부분의 경우 급여에서 원천징수되는 금액은 다음 두 가지 규칙에 따른 경우 세금 신고서상에 산정된 금액과 거의 일치할 것입니다.
  * 양식 W-4 워크시트에서 귀하에게 해당하는 모든 항목을 정확하게 작성한 경우.
  * 변경사항이 발생해 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출한 경우.


다만, 워크시트와 원천징수 계산법이 모든 상황에 적용될 수는 없으므로 알맞은 원천징수액 계산이 어려울 수도 있습니다. 예를 들면 다음과 같은 상황에 해당할 수 있습니다.
  * 부부가 모두 일할 경우.
  * 한번에 직장이 2개 이상인 경우.
  * 이자, 배당금, 위자료, 실업 수당, 자영업 수입 등 임금이 아닌 소득이 있는 경우.
  * 자영업세 등 세금 신고 시 납부할 추가 금액이 있는 경우.
  * 연중 상당 기간에 해당하는 양식 W-4 상의 정보가 더 이상 유효하지 않은 정보이며 이를 바탕으로 원천징수액이 계산된 경우.
  * 연중 일부 기간에만 일하는 경우.
  * 연중 원천징수액을 변경하는 경우.
  * 추가 메디케어 세금 또는 순 투자 소득세 (NIIT)의 대상일 경우. 추가 메디케어 세금 또는 NIIT의 과세가 예상된다면 귀하의 고용주가 추가적인 소득세를 원청징수를 하도록 양식 W-4에서 요청할 수 있습니다.


**누적 임금 방식.**
연중에 원천징수액을 변경하는 경우, 변경 전까지 원천징수액이 과다 또는 과소납부되고 있을 수 있습니다. 귀하의 고용주가 연중 남은 기간 동안 누적 임금 방식 이용에 동의하면 과다 또는 과소납부된 금액을 보완할 수 있습니다. 해당 방식을 이용하려면 고용주에게 서면 요청을 해야 합니다.
이 경우에 적합한 자격이 되려면, 해당 연도의 시작일부터 현재까지 동일한 급여 기간 (주급, 격주 급여 등)을 적용 받고 있어야 합니다. 
#### 간행물 505
원천징수액이 정확한지 확인하려면 간행물 505를 참조하십시오. 연중 원천징수될 세금 총액과 세금 신고서 상에 표시될 세액을 비교할 수 있습니다. 또한, 세금 신고서 제출 시 체납액이 없도록 매 급여일에 해당하는 추가 원천징수액이 얼마인지 확인할 수 있습니다. 충분한 금액이 원천징수되지 않은 경우 추정세를 납부해야 하며, 이에 관해서는 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_간행물 505 대신_[IRS.gov/W4App](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) _에서 세금 원천징수 추정기를 활용하거나 양식 W-4의 워크시트를 작성하여 원천징수액을 증가 또는 감축해야 할 필요가 있는지 확인할 수 있습니다._.
#### 귀하의 고용주가 반드시 따라야 할 규칙
귀하의 고용주가 반드시 따라야 할 원천징수 규칙을 이해하면 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 이 규칙은 양식 W-4를 작성하는 방법과 문제 발생 시 대처 방법에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.
**신규 양식 W-4 작성.**
새로운 직장을 가진 경우, 고용주는 귀하가 작성한 양식 W-4를 보관해야 합니다. 귀하의 첫 급여일을 기준으로 고용주는 귀하가 작성한 양식의 정보를 바탕으로 원천징수를 산정합니다. 
이후 귀하가 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하게 되면, 고용주는 해당 양식이 가능한 한 빨리 효력을 발휘하도록 적용합니다. 귀하가 새 양식을 제출한 날부터 30일 이상 경과한 후에 종료되는 첫 급여 기간의 시작일까지 해당 양식이 효력을 발휘해야 합니다. 
**양식 W-4 미제출.**
양식 W-4를 완벽하게 작성하여 고용주에게 제출하지 않은 경우, 귀하가 미혼인 경우와 같이 고용주는 가장 높은 원천징수율을 적용해야 합니다.
**원천징수액 상환.**
정확한 원천징수액을 설정하지 않아 과다납부된 경우, 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 고용주는 이미 원천징수된 금액을 환급해 줄 수 없습니다. 대신, 원천징수된 총액을 세금 신고서에 기입하십시오. 
그러나, 귀하가 작성하여 유효한 상태인 양식 W-4에 기입된 정확한 금액보다 고용주가 더 많은 금액을 원천징수한 경우, 원천징수액을 알맞은 금액으로 낮추기 위해 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 제출할 필요가 없습니다. 이 경우 고용주는 잘못 원천징수한 금액을 상환할 수 있습니다. 고용주로부터 상환 받지 못한 경우, 양식 W-2에 원천징수된 총액이 반영될 것이며, 이를 세금 신고 시 청구하십시오. 
#### 원천징수 면제
귀하가 원천징수 면제를 청구하는 경우, 고용주는 귀하의 임금에서 연방 소득세를 원천징수하지 않습니다. 면제는 소득세에만 적용되며, 사회 보장, 메디케어, 또는 연방 실업 세법 (FUTA) 관련 세금 원천징수에는 적용되지 않습니다.
다음 두 가지 경우에 모두 해당하면 2025년 원천징수 면제를 청구할 수 있습니다.
  * 2024년 기준, 납부할 세금이 없어 모든 연방 소득세 원천징수액을 환급 받을 권리가 있었던 경우.
  * 2025년 기준, 납부할 세금이 없어 모든 연방 소득세 원천징수액을 환급 받을 것으로 예상되는 경우.


**학생.**
귀하가 학생인 경우 자동으로 면제 대상이 되지 않습니다. 1장을 참조하여 세금 신고를 해야하는지 확인하십시오. 파트타임으로만 일하거나 여름에만 일하는 경우, 원천징수 면제 대상이 될 수 있습니다.
**만 65세 이상 또는 시각 장애인.**
만 65세 이상 또는 시각 장애인인 경우, 간행물 505의 1장, 워크시트 1-1 또는 1-2를 이용하여 원천징수 면제 자격이 있는지 확인하십시오. 2025년 세금 신고서에 항목별 공제를 적용하거나 세액공제를 청구할 예정인 경우 이 워크시트를 사용하지 마십시오. 대신, 간행물 505의 1장, _항목별 공제 또는 세액공제 청구_ 를 참조하십시오.
**원천징수 면제 청구.**
면제를 청구하려면 고용주에게 양식 W-4를 제출해야 합니다. 해당 양식에서 4단계(c)의 공란에 “Exempt” (면제) 라고 기입하고 해당하는 단계의 양식을 작성하시기 바랍니다.
면제를 청구하고 향후 상황이 바뀌어 소득세를 납부하게 된 경우, 해당 변화가 발생한 날짜부터 10일 내에 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 제출해야 합니다. 2025년에 면제를 청구하지만 2026년에 소득세를 납부해야 할 것으로 예상되는 경우, 2025년 12월 1일까지 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 제출해야 합니다. 
IRS가 귀하가 청구한 면제 자격 여부를 검토할 수도 있습니다. 
_**면제는 1년 동안만 유효합니다**_
면제 자격을 유지하려면 매년 2월 15일까지 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 
#### 추가 급여
추가 급여에는 보너스, 커미션, 초과 근무 수당, 휴가 수당, 특정 병가 수당, 특정 계획에 따른 비용 수당 등이 포함됩니다. 추가 임금 지급인은 귀하의 정기 임금에 적용한 것과 동일한 방법으로 추가 임금에 대한 원천징수액을 산정할 수 있습니다. 그러나 귀하의 정기 임금과 추가 임금을 별개로 구분하는 경우, 추가 임금을 지급하는 고용주 또는 지급인은 고정 비율을 기준으로 추가 임금에서 소득세를 원천징수할 수 있습니다.
**비용 수당.**
증빙 서류를 제출하지 못한 고용주가 변제한 사업 비용 또는 고용주가 지급한 기타 비용 수당은 추가 임금에 해당합니다. 
증빙 서류를 제출한 고용주가 변제한 사업 비용 또는 고용주가 지급한 기타 비용 수당에서 증빙된 금액을 초과하는 금액이 있을 경우, 합리적인 기간 내에 잔여 금액을 상환하지 않을 경우 해당 금액은 비어카운터블 플랜 경우와 마찬가지로 취급됩니다. 
증빙 서류를 제출한 경우와 제출하지 못한 경우의 비용 수당에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 505를 참조하십시오.
#### 과징금
아래 두 가지 경우에 모두 해당하는 경우 과징금 $500을 납부해야 합니다.
  * 양식 W-4에 기입한 정보 또는 원천징수액이 금액을 낮추기 위한 목적으로 기입된 경우.
  * 양식 W-4 작성 시 기입한 정보 또는 원천징수액을 뒷받침하는 합리적 근거가 없는 경우.


양식 W-4에 의도적으로 잘못된 또는 사기성 정보를 기입, 또는 원천징수액을 올려야 하는 정보를 의도적으로 누락에 대한 형사처벌이 있습니다. 유죄 판결을 받을 경우 최대 $1,000의 과징금 및 또는 최대 1년의 징역에 처할 수 있습니다.
합당한 원천징수액을 줄이거나 면제 받기 위해 의도적으로 양식 W-4에 허위 정보를 기입한 경우 위와 같은 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다. 단순 오류 또는 의도하지 않은 실수인 경우에는 처벌을 받지 않습니다.
#### 팁
근무 중 받은 팁은 급여의 일부로 취급합니다. 세금 신고서 작성 시 정기 급여와 동일한 항목에 팁을 포함해야 합니다. 다만 정기 급여처럼 팁 소득에서 바로 세금이 원천징수되지는 않습니다. 그러나, 고용주는 정기 급여에서 원천징수할 금액을 산정할 때 팁을 급여에 포함합니다.
고용주에게 팁 소득을 신고하는 방법에 관한 자세한 정보 및 팁 소득의 원천징수에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 531, 팁 소득 신고를 참조하십시오.
**고용주의 원천징수액 산정 방법.**
고용주에게 신고하는 팁 소득은 해당 월에 신고하는 귀하의 소득의 일부로 취급됩니다. 고용주는 다음 두 가지 방법으로 원천징수액을 산정할 수 있습니다. 
  * 정기 급여와 신고한 팁 소득을 합한 총액에 정기 비율을 적용한 금액을 원천징수.
  * 정기 급여에 정기 비율을 적용한 금액과 신고한 팁 소득의 일정 비율을 원천징수. 


**원천징수 할 금액에 비해 급여가 부족한 경우.**
고용주가 귀하의 정기 급여와 팁 소득에 대해 원천징수할 총액 (소득세, 사회 보장 및 메디케어 관련 세금, 또는 이에 상응하는 철도 직원 은퇴 계획 관련 세금을 포함한 금액) 보다 정기 급여가 적은 경우, 고용주에게 해당 금액을 제공하여 부족액을 채울 수 있습니다. 간행물 531을 참조하십시오.
**분배된 팁.**
고용주는 분배된 팁에 대해 소득세, 사회 보장 및 메디케어 관련 세금, 또는 철도 직원 은퇴 계획 관련 세금을 원천징수할 수 없습니다. 원천징수는 반드시 정기 급여와 신고된 팁 소득만 기준으로 합니다. 고용주는 이와 관련하여 잘못 원천징수한 세금을 반드시 반환해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 531을 참조하십시오. 
#### 과세 대상 복리 후생
고용주에게서 지급 받은 특정 비현금 복리 후생의 가치는 급여의 일부로 취급합니다. 고용주는 반드시 일반적으로 이러한 혜택에 대한 소득세를 급여에서 원천징수합니다.
복리 후생에 관한 자세한 정보는 5장의 _직원 보수_ 에서 [_복리 후생_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171226 "복리 후생")을 참조하십시오.
고용주가 제공한 자동차, 트럭, 또는 기타 고속도로 통행이 가능한 차량을 개인적으로 사용하는 경우 해당 가치는 과세 대상이지만, 고용주는 해당 금액에 대한 소득세를 원천징수하지 않기로 선택할 수 있습니다. 고용주는 이러한 결정을 내릴 경우 귀하에게 통지해야 합니다.
과세 대상 복리 후생의 원천징수에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 505의 1장을 참조하십시오.
#### 병가 수당
병가 수당은 질병 또는 상해로 인해 일시적으로 휴직하는 기간 동안 정기 급여를 대체하는 수당입니다. 병가 수당을 받기 위해서는 고용주가 당사자로 포함되는 제도 하에 지급되어야 합니다.
고용주 또는 고용주의 대리인으로부터 병가 수당을 받는 경우 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 귀하에게 정기 급여를 지급하지 않는 대리인은 고정 비율을 기준으로 소득세를 원천징수할지 여부를 선택할 수 있습니다.
그러나, 고용주의 대리인이 아닌 제 삼자가 귀하에게 병가 수당을 지급하는 경우, 귀하가 선택하는 경우에만 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_양식 W-4S_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032371 "양식 W-4S.")를 참조하십시오.
고용주가 포함되지 않는 제도 하에 특정 금액을 지급 받는 경우 (사고 발생 시, 또는 귀하가 보험료 전액을 납부하는 의료 보험에서 받는 경우), 해당 지급액은 병가 수당이 아니므로 과세 대상이 아닙니다.
**노동 조합 협약.**
귀하가 가입한 노동 조합과 고용주 간의 단체 협약에 따라 병가 수당을 지급 받는 경우, 해당 협약에는 소득세 원천징수 금액이 명시되어 있을 수 도 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 노동 조합 대표 또는 고용주를 통해 확인하시기 바랍니다. 
**양식 W-4S.**
귀하가 보험 회사 등 제 삼자가 지급하는 병가 수당에서 소득세를 원천징수하기로 결정한 경우, 양식 W-4S를 작성해야 합니다. 해당 양식에는 원천징수액 산정에 활용할 수 있는 워크시트가 포함되어 있습니다. 또한 적용되는 제한 사항도 설명되어 있습니다.
이 양식을 완벽하게 작성하여 병가 수당 지급인에게 제출하십시오. 지급인은 귀하가 양식에 기입한 내용에 따라 원천징수를 해야 합니다. 
**추정세.**
양식 W-4S로 원천징수를 요청하지 않거나 원천징수할 만큼 충분한 세금이 없는 경우, 추정세를 납부해야 할 수도 있습니다. 원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오. 
#### 은퇴 연금 및 연금
귀하가 원천징수하지 않기로 결정하지 않은 이상, 일반적으로 은퇴 연금 또는 연금 분배금에서는 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. 이 규칙은 다음으로부터의 인출금에 적용됩니다.
  * 전형적인 개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA)
  * 지불금, 연금, 또는 생명보험 계약을 체결한 생명 보험 회사
  * 은퇴 연금, 연금, 또는 이익 분배 계획
  * 주식 보너스 플랜
  * 그 밖에 귀하의 보상금 지급 시기를 유보하는 모든 계획.


원천징수액은 1년을 초과하는 기간에 걸쳐 지급 받는지 (주기적 지급), 1년 내에 지급 받는지 (비주기적 지급), 또는 적격 롤오버 인출금 (ERD)의 형태로 받는지에 따라 달라집니다. ERD의 소득세 원천징수는 의무 사항입니다.
**추가 정보.**
양식 W-4P에 관한 설명을 비롯하여 은퇴 연금 및 연금의 원천징수에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 505의 1장, _은퇴 연금 및 연금_ 을 참조하십시오. 
#### 도박 수익
특정 유형의 도박 수익에서는 24%의 고정 비율을 기준으로 소득세를 원천징수합니다.
다음과 같은 출처에서 얻은 $5,000를 초과하는 도박 수익은 소득세 원천징수 대상입니다.
  * 모든 유형의 독점 내기, 포커 토너먼트 우승 상금을 비롯한 시합 내기, 복권.
  * 수익금이 내기에 건 금액의 300배를 초과하는 모든 도박.


수익금이 현금, 부동산, 연금 중 어느 형태든 상관 없습니다. 현금이 아닌 수익금은 공정한 시장 가치를 기준으로 금액을 산정합니다. 
_**예외.**_
빙고 게임, 키노, 슬롯머신으로 얻은 도박 수익은 일반적으로 소득세 원천징수 대상이 아닙니다. 그러나 원천징수가 되지 않으려면 지급인에게 귀하의 사회 보장 번호를 제출해야 합니다. 간행물 505의 1장, _도박 수익의 예비 원천징수_ 를 참조하십시오. 원천징수 대상이 아닌 도박 수익에 대해서는 추정세를 납부해야 합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오. 
원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오.
**양식 W-2G.**
지급인이 귀하의 도박 수익에서 소득세를 원천징수하는 경우, 도박 수익 및 부과된 세금 금액이 표시된 양식 W-2G, ‘특정 도박 수익’을 수령해야 합니다. 원천징수액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 라인 25c에 신고하십시오.
#### 실업 수당
귀하는 실업 수당에서 소득세가 원천징수되도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 원천징수를 선택하려면 양식 W-4V (또는 지급인이 제공하는 유사 양식)를 작성하여 지급인에게 제출하십시오.
모든 실업 수당은 과세 대상입니다. 원천징수한 소득세가 없다면 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오.
원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 자세한 사항은 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오.

  1. 사회보장 혜택.
  2. 1 단계 철도 은퇴 계획 혜택.
  3. 총 소득에 포함하기로 선택한 상품신용공사 대출금.
  4. 1949년 농업법 개정 조항 (7 U.S.C. 1421 이하 참조) 또는 1988년 재해구호법 2편에 의거하여 보험 수익금으로 취급하는 지급금으로서 다음 이유로 지급 받는 경우:
    1. 가뭄, 홍수, 기타 자연재해로 인해 재배하는 작물이 모두 망가지거나 손상을 입은 경우
    2. (a)에서 설명하는 자연재해로 인해 작물을 재배할 수 없었던 경우.
  5. 재무부 장관의 결정에 따라 연방법에 의거하여 제공되는 모든 지급금.


원천징수를 선택하려면 양식 W-4V (또는 지급인이 제공하는 유사 양식)를 작성하여 지급인에게 제출하십시오.
원천징수할 소득세가 없다면 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_2025년 추정세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032382 "2025년 추정세")를 참조하십시오.
원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 자세한 사항은 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오.
**추가 정보.**
사회 보장 및 철도 은퇴 혜택에 관한 자세한 과세 정보는 7장을 참조하십시오. 또한, 간행물 225, ‘농업 종사자 세금 안내서’에서 상품신용공사 대출금 또는 작물 재해 지급금에 관한 자세한 과세 정보를 참조하십시오.
#### 예비 원천징수
은행 또는 특정 유형의 소득을 제공하는 기타 사업체는 IRS에 정보 신고서 (양식 1099)를 제출해야 합니다. 정보 신고서는 귀하가 연중 지급 받은 금액을 명시합니다. 또한 귀하의 이름 및 납세자 식별 번호 (TIN)도 기입되어 있습니다. TIN은 1장의 [_사회보장번호 (SSN)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170567 "사회 보장 번호 \(SSN\)") 부분에 설명되어 있습니다.
이러한 지급금은 일반적으로 원천징수 대상이 아닙니다. 그러나 특정 상황에서는 “예비” 원천징수가 요구됩니다. 예비 원천징수는 양식 1099에 신고된 대부분의 지급금에 적용될 수 있습니다.
다음과 같은 상황에서 지급인은 24%의 고정 비율을 기준으로 원천징수해야 합니다.
  * 귀하가 지급인에게 알맞은 방식으로 TIN을 제공하지 않은 경우.
  * 귀하가 제출한 TIN이 부정확하다는 사실을 IRS가 지급인에게 통지한 경우.
  * 귀하가 예비 원천징수 대상이 아니라는 사실을 증명해야 하지만 실패한 경우.
  * 귀하가 소득세 신고 시 취득한 이자 또는 배당금 금액을 과소신고하여 IRS가 지급인에게 해당 이자 또는 배당금에 대한 원천징수를 시작하라고 통지한 경우. 이 조치는 IRS가 귀하에게 사전 통지를 4회 발송한 후 실시합니다.


[IRS.gov/Businesses/Small-businesses-self-employed/Backup-withholding(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/backup-withholding)를 방문하십시오. 예비 원천징수 대상이 되는 모든 유형의 지급금에 관한 자세한 정보를 확인할 수 있습니다.
**과징금.**
예비 원천징수를 피하기 위해 허위 정보를 기입하는 경우 민사 및 형사 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다. 민사 처벌은 $500의 과징금입니다. 형사 처벌의 경우, 유죄 판결을 받은 경우 최대 $1,000의 과징금 및 또는 1년 이하의 징역에 처할 수 있습니다. 
#### 2025년 추정세
추정세는 원천징수 대상이 아닌 소득에 대해 세금을 납부하는 방식입니다. 추정세에는 자영업 수입, 이자, 배당금, 위자료, 임대료, 자산 처분에 따른 수입, 상, 보상 등에 대한 세금이 포함됩니다. 또한 급여, 은퇴 연금 및 기타 소득에서 원천징수된 소득세가 충분하지 않은 경우에도 추정세를 납부해야 합니다.
추정세는 소득세, 자영업세, 그 외에 귀하의 세금 신고서에 기입된 다른 세금 및 금액을 지불하기 위해 활용됩니다. 원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 각 기간의 납부 제출 기한 내에 세금을 충분히 납부하지 않은 경우 ([_추정세 납부 시기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032395 "추정세 납부 시기") 참조), 세금 신고 시 환급을 청구하더라도 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 과징금이 적용되는 시기에 관한 자세한 사항은 이 장의 마지막 부분에서 [_2024년 과소납부 과징금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032429 "2024년 과소납부 과징금")을 참조하십시오.
#### 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 되는 사람
급여 또는 임금을 받는 경우, 고용주에게 귀하의 급여에서 더 높은 금액을 원천징수하도록 요청하면 추정세를 피할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해서는 양식 W-4를 새로 작성하여 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 간행물 505의 1장을 참조하십시오.
**추정세가 요구되지 않음.**
다음 세 가지 조건에 모두 부합하는 경우 2025년 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
  * 2024년에 세금 채무가 없었던 경우.
  * 해당 연도 내내 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인 신분을 유지한 경우.
  * 귀하의 2024년 세금 신고서가 12개월 기간을 다루고 있는 경우.


2024년에 세금 총액이 0이었거나 소득세 신고 의무 대상자가 아니었다면 해당 연도에 납부해야 하는 체납 세금이 없었을 것입니다. 2024년 “total tax” (세금 총액)에 관한 정의는 간행물 505의 2장을 참조하십시오.
#### 추정세를 반드시 납부해야 하는 사람
2024년에 미납한 추가 세금이 있는 경우, 2025년에 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다.
연중 내내 다음의 일반 규칙을 참고하여 원천징수액이 충분한지, 원천징수액을 올려야 하는지, 혹은 추정세를 납부해야 하는지 확인하시기 바랍니다.
**일반 규칙.**
대부분의 경우 다음 두 가지 상황에 모두 해당하면 2025년에 추정세를 납부해야 합니다. 
  1. 원천징수 및 환급 가능 공제액을 제외한후 2025년에 납부할 세금이 $1,000 이상인 경우.
  2. 원천징수액과 환급 가능 공제액의 합이 다음 금액보다 적은 경우.
    1. 2025년 세금 신고서에 기입될 세금의 90%
    2. 2024년 세금 신고서에 기입된 세금의 100% (뒤에서 다룰 [농업 및 어업 종사자, 고소득 납세자를 위한 특별 규칙](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032387 "농업 및 어업 종사자, 고소득 납세자를 위한 특별 규칙.") 참고). 귀하의 2024년 세금 신고서는 12개월의 기간을 다루어야 합니다.

[Please click here for the text description of the image.](https://www.irs.gov/media/286161)
**외국인.**
거주 및 비거주 외국인도 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 거주 외국인은 별도의 통지가 없는 이상 이 장에서 명시하는 규칙을 준수해야 합니다. 비거주 외국인은 양식 1040-ES (NR), ‘비거주 외국인 개인을 위한 미국 추정세’를 이용해야 합니다. 
귀하가 미국 시민 또는 국민이 아닌 경우, 귀하는 외국인입니다. 귀하가 미국 영주권이 있거나 실질 거주자 요건을 충족하는 경우, 귀하는 거주 외국인입니다. 실질 거주자 요건에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 519, ‘외국인을 위한 미국 세금 안내서’를 참조하십시오. 
**기혼 납세자.**
공동 추정세 납부 자격을 갖춘 경우, 여기에서 설명된 규칙을 귀하의 공동 추정 소득에 적용하십시오. 
귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 동일한 주소에 거주하지 않아도 공동 추정세 납부를 할 수 있습니다.
그러나, 다음 상황에 해당하는 경우 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 공동 추정세 납부를 할 수 없습니다. 
  * 이혼 또는 별거 생활 유지 명령에 따라 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 법적으로 별거 중인 경우
  * 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 다른 과세 연도를 갖고 있는 경우
  * 부부 중 한 명이 비거주 외국인인 경우 (세금 관련 행위를 위해 해당 배우자를 영주권자로 취급하도록 선택된 경우 제외, 이에 관해서는 간행물 519의 1장 참조).


귀하 및 귀하의 배우자가 추정세 납부를 할 수 없는 경우, 여기에서 설명된 규칙을 귀하의 별도 추정 소득에 적용하십시오. 부부의 추정세 납부 방식이 공동인지 별도인지는 2025년 공동 신고서 또는 개별 세금 신고서 제출 여부에 영향을 미치지 않습니다. 
_**2024년 개별 신고서와 2025년 공동 신고서**_
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년에는 개별 신고서를 제출했으나 2025년에는 공동 신고서를 제출할 계획인 경우, 귀하의 2024년 세금은 개별 신고서에 표시된 세금 총액입니다. 귀하가 세금 신고 시 납세자 구분을 미혼이나 세대주로 한 경우, 또는 부부 개별 신고를 한 경우 개별 신고서 제출을 한 것입니다. 
_**2024년 공동 신고서와 2025년 개별 신고서**_
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년에는 공동 신고서를 제출했으나 2025년에는 개별 신고서를 제출하려는 경우, 귀하의 2024년 세금은 공동 신고서에 표시된 세금 총액 중 귀하의 지분에 해당하는 금액입니다. 귀하가 세금 신고 시 납세자 구분을 미혼이나 세대주로 하는 경우, 또는 개별 신고를 하는 경우 개별 신고서 제출을 하게 됩니다. 
공동 신고서 상의 세액에서 귀하의 지분을 산정하려면, 우선 2025년에 적용할 납세자 구분을 동일하게 적용하여 2024년 개별 신고서 제출을 했다는 가정하에 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 납부해야 했을 금액을 산정합니다. 다음으로, 공동 신고서 상의 세액에 다음 분수식을 곱합니다. 
| 개별 신고서 제출을 했다면 귀하가 납부해야 했을 세액 |   
---|---|---  
개별 신고서 제출을 했다면 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 납부해야 했을 세금 총액  
**예시.**
납세자 A와 납세자 B는 2024년에 공동 신고서를 제출했으며, 당시 과세 대상 소득은 $48,500, 세금은 $5,359였습니다. 과세 대상 소득 $48,500 중 납세자 A의 소득은 $40,100, 나머지는 납세자 B의 소득입니다. 둘은 2025년에 개별 신고를 하려고 합니다. 납세자 A 는 다음과 같은 방식으로 2024년 공동 신고서에서 세금을 산정합니다. 
| 개별 신고서에서 $40,100에 부과되는 세금  | $4,583 |   
---|---|---|---  
| 개별 신고서에서 $8,400에 부과되는 세금  | _843_ |   
| 합계  | $5,426 |   
| 총액 중 납세자 A의 지분 ($4,583 ÷ $5,426)  | 85%  |   
| 공동 신고서 제출한 세금 총액에서 납세자 A의 지분 ($5,359 × 85%)  | $4,555 |   
#### 추정세 산정 방법
귀하의 추정세를 산정하려면 해당 연도의 조정총소득 (AGI), 과세 대상 소득, 기타 세금, 공제, 세액공제 등의 금액을 계산해야 합니다.
2025년 추정세 산정 시, 우선 2024년 소득, 공제, 세액공제를 활용하는 것도 좋은 시작 방법입니다. 2024년 연방 세금 신고서를 기준으로 활용해 보십시오. 양식 1040-ES와 간행물 505를 활용하여 추정세를 산정할 수 있습니다. 비거주 외국인은 양식 1040-ES (NR) 및 간행물 505를 이용하여 추정세를 산정하면 됩니다 (자세한 정보는 간행물 519의 8장 참조).
귀하의 상황에 변화가 있거나 최근 세법이 개정된 경우 조정이 필요합니다. 이러한 변경에 관한 설명은 [IRS.gov(영어)](https://www.irs.gov)를 방문하여 확인하십시오.
2025년 추정세 산정에 관한 보다 자세하고 완전한 설명은 간행물 505의 2장을 참조하십시오.
#### 추정세 납부 시기
추정세 납부에 적용되는 과세 연도는 4개 기간으로 나뉩니다. 각 기간마다 정해진 납부 기한이 있습니다. 각 기간의 납부 기한 내에 세금을 충분히 납부하지 않은 경우, 소득세 신고 시 환급을 청구하더라도 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 추정세 납부 기간 및 기한은 다음과 같습니다.
| **기간:** | **납부 기한:*** |   
---|---|---|---

**토요일, 일요일, 법정 공휴일 규칙.**
추정세 납부 기한 마감일이 토요일, 일요일, 또는 법정 공휴일인 경우, 토요일, 일요일, 또는 법정 공휴일이 아닌 익일에 납부하면 기한 내 납부한 것이 됩니다.

**회계 연도 납세자.**
귀하에게 해당되는 과세 연도의 시작일이 1월 1일이 아닌 경우, 양식 1040-ES의 내용에서 납부 기한을 확인하십시오. 
#### 시작 시기
소득세 과세 대상 소득이 발생하기 전까지는 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 추정세 납부 1차 기간 내에 추정세 과세 대상 소득이 발생하는 경우, 1차 기간의 납부 기한 내에 1차 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 해당 기간에 추정세 전액을 납부해도 되고, 분할 납부해도 됩니다. 분할 납부를 선택하는 경우, 1차 기간의 납부 기한 내에 1차 세금을 납부하십시오. 추정세 잔여 금액은 나머지 기간의 납부 기한 내에 납부하면 됩니다.
**추정세 납부 1차 기간 내 과세 대상 소득이 없는 경우.**

**과징금 방지를 위해 납부해야 하는 세액.**
각 기한 내에 납부해야 하는 세금을 계산하려면 아래의 [_각 납부액 산정 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032402 "각 납부 금액 산정 방법")을 참조하십시오.
#### 각 납부 금액 산정 방법
각 기간별 납부 기한 내에 추정세를 충분히 납부해야 해당 기간에 대한 과징금이 부과되지 않습니다. 정기 분할 납부 또는 연간 소득세 분할 납부 중 한 가지 방식으로 각 기간에 납부해야 하는 세금을 산정할 수 있습니다. 이 방법들은 간행물 505의 2장을 참조하십시오. 각 납부 기간 내에 세금을 충분히 납부하지 않은 경우, 세금 신고 시 환급을 청구하더라도 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다.
귀하가 앞서 다룬 [_추정세 납부 1차 기간 내 과세 대상 소득이 없는 경우_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032400 "추정세 납부 1차 기간 내 과세 대상 소득이 없는 경우."), 또는 이후 설명할 [_추정세 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032404 "추정세 변경.")이 필요한 경우에 해당한다면, 간행물 505의 2장, _연간 소득 분할 납부 방법_ 에서 과징금을 방지하는 방법을 참고하십시오.
**과소납부 과징금.**
정기 분할 납부 방식에서는 4개 기간 중 특정 기간 내 납부한 추정세가 해당 연도 추정세 총액의 1/4 이하인 경우, 세금 신고 시 해당 기간에 대한 추정세 과소납부로 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 연간 소득 분할 납부 방식에서는 귀하의 소득에 따라 기간별 추정세 납부 금액이 달라지지만, 각 기간에 부과되는 금액은 반드시 납부해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 _양식 2210의_ 지침을 참조하십시오.
**추정세 변경.**
특정 기간 내 추정세 납부 후, 귀하의 소득, 조정 사항, 공제, 또는 세액공제 등의 상태에 변화가 발생하여 추정세를 다시 산정해야 할 수 있습니다. 변화가 발생한 후 다음 기간의 납부 기한 내에 변경된 추정세의 미납 금액 전부를 납부하거나, 다음 기간들의 납부 기한 내에 분할 납부하십시오.
#### 추정세 불필요
각 납부 기한에 원천징수되는 금액이 다음 금액 이상인 경우, 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 됩니다.
  * 해당 연도에 납부해야 하는 총액의 1/4
  * 연간 소득 분할 납부 기준으로 해당 기간 내 납부해야 하는 금액.


귀하가 향후 납부할 원천징수액이 충분하여 세금 신고 시 세금 채무가 $1,000 미만이 될 경우에도 추정세를 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
#### 추정세 납부 방법
추정세 납부 방법에는 여러 가지가 있습니다.
  * 2024년 세금 신고서의 과다납부한 금액을 2025년 추정세로 적용.
  * 은행 계좌에서 직접 이전을 통한 납부, 또는 전화 납부 계정이나 인터넷을 이용하여 직불 카드 또는 신용 카드로 납부.
  * 양식 1040-ES의 납부 전표와 함께 납부 (수표 또는 우편환 이용).


#### 과다납부액 적용
2024년 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 작성하여 세금을 과다납부 했음을 증명하면, 해당 금액의 일부 또는 전체를 2025년 추정세에 적용할 수 있습니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 36에 환급 대신 추정세로 적용하고 싶은 금액을 기입하십시오. 적용한 금액을 추정세 납부 금액 산정 시 고려하십시오.
다음 해 세금 신고 전까지는 추정세에 적용한 금액이 환급되지 않습니다. 또한 다른 방식으로도 과다납부된 금액은 활용할 수 없습니다.
#### 온라인 납부
IRS는 귀하에게 알맞은 전자 납부 방법을 제공합니다. 온라인 납부는 편리하고 안전하며 귀하의 세금을 IRS가 제때 수령하는 데 도움을 줍니다. [IRS.gov/Payments](https://www.irs.gov/ko/payments)를 방문하여 온라인으로 세금을 납부하거나 이와 관련한 자세한 정보를 알아보십시오. 다음과 같은 방식으로 납부할 수 있습니다.

#### 추정세 납부 전표와 함께 수표 또는 우편환을 사용한 납부
추정세 납부 전표를 이용하여 우편으로 납부하기 전에 우선 대체안을 고려해주시기 바랍니다. 안전하고 신속하며 간편한 전자 납부 방식을 이용하실 수도 있습니다.
우편 납부를 원하시는 경우, 추정세 납부에 사용할 수표 또는 우편환과 양식 1040-ES에 있는 납부 전표를 함께 보내주시기 바랍니다.
2024년에 다음 상황에 해당했는지 확인해 주십시오.
  * 1회 이상 추정세를 납부했으나 전자 납부가 아닌 방식을 이용한 경우
  * 세금 신고서 작성 또는 제출 시 소프트웨어나 유료 신고서 작성대행인을 이용하지 않은 경우,


위에 해당한다면 2025년 양식 1040-ES와 납부 전표의 사본을 수령해야 합니다. 
동봉하실 납부 전표에는 귀하의 이름, 주소, 사회 보장번호가 미리 인쇄됩니다. 이렇게 인쇄된 전표를 이용하면 처리가 한결 빨라지고, 오류를 방지하며, 처리 비용을 줄일 수 있습니다.
양식 1040-ES 패키지에 포함된 투명창이 있는 봉투를 사용하십시오. 임의의 봉투를 사용하시는 경우, 양식 1040-ES에 안내된 주소 중 귀하의 거주지에 해당하는 주소로 납부 전표를 보내주시기 바랍니다.
_**$1억 이상 수표는 수취하지 않습니다.**_
IRS는 한 장에 $100,000,000 ($1억) 이상인 수표 (자기앞수표 포함)는 수취하지 않습니다. 수표를 통해 $1억 이상을 전달하고자 하는 경우, 각각 $1억 미만인 수표 두 장 이상에 나누어 납부해야 합니다. 이 제한 금액은 (전자 납부 방식과 같은) 다른 납부 방식에는 적용되지 않습니다. 납부할 금액이 $1억을 넘어갈 경우, 수표가 아닌 다른 납부 방식을 고려해주십시오.
### 비고.
이 기준은 별도의 통지 없이 변경될 수 있습니다. 양식 1040-ES 패키지를 수령하지 않았으나 추정세를 납부해야 하는 경우, [IRS.gov/Form1040–ES)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es)에서 4장의 납부 전표 기본 양식을 포함한 양식 1040-ES를 인쇄하십시오. 이중 한 가지를 작성하고 기한 내에 납부해야 세금 납부 지연에 대한 과징금을 방지할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_양식 1040의 지침에 나와있는 주소로 추정세를 납부하지 마십시오._.
작년에 추정세를 납부하지 않았다면, IRS에 양식 1040-ES를 요청(본 간행물의 뒷표지 안쪽을 확인해 주십시오)하거나 IRS.gov에서 다운로드 받을 수 있습니다. 납부 전표를 올바르게 사용하기 위해 안내 사항을 준수해 주시기 바랍니다.
**공동 추정세 납부.**
귀하가 공동 신고서를 제출하며 공동 추정세 납부를 하려는 경우, 공동 세금 신고서에 기입된 것과 동일한 순서로 납부 전표에 이름 및 사회 보장 번호를 기입해 주십시오.
**주소 변경.**
귀하가 추정세 납부 대상이며 연중 주소를 변경하신 경우 반드시 IRS에 알리셔야 합니다. 양식 8822, ‘주소 변경’을 작성하여 해당 양식의 안내에 따른 주소로 보내주시기 바랍니다.
#### 2024년 원천징수 및 추정세에 대한 세액공제
2024년 소득세 신고 시, 귀하의 급여, 임금, 은퇴 연금 등에서 원천징수된 모든 소득세와 사회 보장 및 철도 은퇴 계획 중 과잉분에 대한 세액공제를 받으십시오. 이미 납부한 2024년 추정세에 대한 세액공제 또한 받을 수 있습니다. 귀하의 세금 총액에서 이 금액이 공제됩니다. 이 공제액은 환급이 가능하며, 미납 세금이 없어도 세금 신고를 해야 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**직장이 2개 이상인 경우.**
2024년에 직장 (고용주)이 2개 이상이었고 임금 총액이 $168,600를 초과하는 경우, 귀하의 급여에서 과도한 금액의 사회 보장 또는 1단계 철도 은퇴 계획 관련 세금이 원천징수 되었을 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 과잉 원천징수 금액을 세금 신고 시 적용하여 소득세에서 공제할 것을 청구할 수 있습니다.양식 1040의 안내서를 참조하십시오.

이 내역서에는 귀하가 배우자와 공동 또는 개별로 납부한 금액을 모두 기입해야 합니다. 
이와 같은 변경사항은 반드시 사회 보장국에 신고해야 합니다. 그래야 세금 신고서 처리 및 환급 지연을 방지할 수 있습니다.
#### 개별 신고서
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 2024년에 개별로 추정세를 납부하고 개별 신고서 제출을 하는 경우, 귀하의 납부액에 해당하는 금액만 공제받을 수 있습니다.
배우자와 공동으로 추정세를 납부했다면, 각각의 신고서에서 납부한 금액을 어떻게 나눌지 결정해야 합니다. 부부 중 한 명이 추정세 납부 총액을 공제 청구하고 나머지 한 명은 공제를 청구하지 않거나, 합의 하에 다른 방식으로 나눠도 됩니다. 합의를 할 수 없는 경우, 2024년 개별 신고서 상에 기입된 각자의 세금에 비례하도록 추정세 납부액을 나누어야 합니다.
#### 이혼한 납세자
2024년에 대한 추정세를 배우자와 공동 납부한 이후 해당 연도에 이혼을 하는 경우, 둘 중 한 명이 추정세 납부 총액을 공제 청구하고 나머지 한 명은 공제를 청구하지 않거나, 금액을 나누어 각자 일부를 공제 청구해도 됩니다. 납부액을 나누는 방법에 대해 합의를 할 수 없는 경우, 각자의 2024년 세금 신고서 상에 기입된 세금에 비례하도록 추정세 납부액을 나누어야 합니다.
공동 납부한 추정세를 세금 신고 시 공제 받으려는 경우, 전 배우자의 사회 보장 번호 (SSN)를 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 앞면의 해당란에 기입하시기 바랍니다. 2024년에 이혼한 후 재혼하는 경우, 현 배우자의 SSN을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 앞면의 해당란에 기입하시기 바랍니다. 또한, 라인 26 옆의 점선 위에 전 배우자의 SSN과 “DIV”를 기입하십시오.
#### 2024년 과소납부 과징금
원천징수나 기간별 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 추정세 과소납부 상태가 되어 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다.
일반적으로, 아래 상황 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 2024년에 대한 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다.

#### 직원 보수
이 섹션에서는 복리 후생, 은퇴 연금 플랜 보수, 주식 옵션, 조건부 자산 등 다양한 유형의 직원 보수에 대해 설명합니다.
**양식 W-2.**
귀하가 직원인 경우, 노동의 대가로 받은 급여가 기입된 양식 W-2를 고용주에게서 받아야 합니다. 양식 W-2를 수령하지 않았더라도 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 1a에 급여를 기입하십시오. 
일부 경우에는 귀하의 고용주가 양식 W-2를 전달할 의무가 없을 수도 있습니다. 귀하가 고용주의 집에서 가사 노동에 대한 대가로 해당 일반 연도 동안 $2,700 미만의 임금을 현금으로 받으며 해당 임금에서 원천징수 되는 연방 소득세가 없는 경우, 고용주는 양식 W-2를 귀하에게 제공하지 않아도 됩니다. 가사란 고용주의 집 안에서 혹은 주변에서 근로하는 것을 말합니다. 가사 종사자의 예는 다음과 같습니다.

**탁아 서비스 제공자.**
귀하가 아이의 집, 귀하의 집, 또는 기타 다른 사업 장소에서 탁아 서비스를 제공하는 경우, 귀하가 받은 급여는 소득으로 포함시켜야 합니다. 귀하가 직원이 아닌 경우 자영업자일 것이고, 이 경우 스케줄 C (양식 1040), ‘사업 이익 또는 손실’에 서비스를 제공하고 받은 급여를 기입해야 합니다. 귀하를 고용한 사람이 귀하의 업무 및 업무 방식에 대해 지시와 통제를 하지 않는 이상 일반적으로 귀하는 직원이 아닙니다.
_**배이비시팅.**_
귀하가 친척이나 이웃의 자녀를 돌봐주고 급여를 받은 경우, 해당 급여가 정기 급여인지 또는 단순 주기적 급여인지와 관계없이 탁아 서비스 제공자에게 적용되는 규칙이 동일하게 적용됩니다.
**자영업세.**
귀하가 직원인지 또는 자영업자인지와 관계없이 귀하의 소득은 자영업세 과세 대상입니다. 귀하가 자영업자인 경우, 스케줄 C 및 SE (양식 1040)의 지침을 참조하십시오. 또한, 자세한 정보는 간행물 926을 참조하십시오.
#### 기타 보수
이 섹션에서는 다양한 유형의 직원 보수에 대해 설명합니다.
**선불 커미션 및 기타 소득.**
귀하가 앞으로 제공할 서비스에 대해 선불로 커미션 또는 기타 금액을 지급 받았으며 귀하가 현금주의 회계처리 방법 납세자인 경우, 지급을 받은 연도의 소득에 해당 금액을 포함해야 합니다.
귀하가 받은 선수 커미션 또는 기타 금액을 같은 연도 내에 상환하는 경우, 소득에 포함된 상환 금액을 차감하십시오. 다음 과세 연도에 상환하는 경우, 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 16에 기입하여 항목별 공제로 상환액을 공제 받거나, 같은 연도에 공제를 받을 수도 있습니다. 8장의 [_상환_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172015 "상환")을 참조하십시오.
**수당 및 변제.**
고용주로부터 여행, 교통 수단, 기타 업무 비용에 대한 수당, 또는 그 외 변제를 받은 경우, 간행물 463, ‘출장, 선물, 차량 비용’을 참조하십시오. 군대의 일원이며 이전 비용을 변제받은 경우에는 간행물 521, ‘이사 비용’을 참조하십시오.
**소급 임금 보상.**
귀하가 소급 임금 정산 또는 판결에 따른 보상을 받은 경우, 해당 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 손해에 대한 지급, 미지급 생명보험료, 미지급 의료보험료 등이 이 경우에 해당합니다. 고용주는 이러한 사항을 양식 W-2에 기입하여 귀하에게 전달해야 합니다.
**보너스 및 상.**
고용주로부터 보너스 또는 상 (현금, 상품, 서비스)을 받은 경우, 이에 상응하는 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 그러나 고용주가 향후 보너스 또는 보수를 지급하기로 단순히 약속만 한 경우, 귀하가 실제로 수령하기 전까지는 해당 보너스 또는 상이 귀하를 위해 만들어진 것이 아닌 이상 과세 대상이 아닙니다.
_**직원 공로상.**_
근속 또는 안전성과에 대한 상으로 유형 개인 자산 (현금, 상품권, 또는 이에 상응하는 물품이 아닌것)을 받은 경우, 일반적으로 이에 해당하는 금액은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 소득에서 제외 가능 금액은 고용주가 부담한 비용 범위 내로 제한되며, 귀하가 해당 연도에 지급 받은 모든 보수를 통틀어 유자격 플랜 보수인 경우 $1,600 이하, 비적격 플랜 보수인 경우 $400 이하여야 합니다. 고용주는 귀하에게 지급한 보수의 유자격 플랜 보수 여부를 확인시켜 줄 수 있습니다. 고용주는 해당 상이 위장된 급료가 되는 경우가 없도록 적절한 조건 및 상황에서 의미 있는 형식으로 해당 상을 제공해야 합니다.
그러나 다음에 해당하는 보수는 소득에서 제외할 수 없습니다. 
  * 근속 연수가 5년 미만일 때 받는 근속상, 또는 해당 연도나 최근 4년 내에 또 다른 근속상을 받은 경우. 
  * 경영자, 관리자, 사무직 직원, 또는 기타 전문직 직원이 받는 안전 우수상, 또는 해당 연도에 적격 직원의 10%를 초과하는 인원이 안전 우수상을 이미 받은 경우. 


**예시.**
귀하는 해당 연도에 직원 공로상을 3회 수상했습니다. 비적격 플랜 보수로 가격이 $250인 시계를, 유자격 플랜 보수로 가격이 $1,000인 스피커, $500인 골프 클럽 세트를 받았습니다. 유자격 플랜 보수 요건을 모두 충족한다고 가정할 때, 수령한 보수를 각각 산정할 경우에는 소득에서 제외될 수 있습니다. 그러나 수령한 전체 보수의 총액은 $1,750로서 기준인 $1,600를 초과하므로 귀하는 초과 금액인 $150 ($1,750 – $1,600)를 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**차등 임금 지급.**
이는 귀하가 30일을 초과하는 기간에 걸쳐 현역 군인으로서 군복무을 수행하는 동안 귀하가 해당 기간 동안 근로했다면 받았을 임금의 전부 또는 일부를 고용주가 지급하는 것을 말합니다. 이 지급금은 임금으로 간주하며 소득세 원천징수 대상이지만, FICA 또는 연방 실업 세법 (FUTA) 세금 대상은 아닙니다. 이 지불금은 양식 W-2에 임금으로 기입하여 신고해야 합니다.
**공무원 생계 수당.**
해외에서 근무하는 미국 정부 공무원이 받는 대부분의 급여는 과세 대상입니다. 그러나 특정 생계 수당은 면세 대상입니다. 간행물 516, ‘해외 근무 미국 정부 공무원’은 해외 근무 시 지급받는 수당, 차등 임금, 기타 특별 급여 등의 세무 처리에 대해 설명합니다.
**비적격 이연 보수 플랜.**
고용주는 양식 W-2의 박스 12에 코드 Y를 표시하여 비적격 이연 보수 플랜에 따른 해당 연도의 이연 총액을 귀하에게 알려야 합니다. 이 금액은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
그러나 해당 과세 연도 도중 해당 플랜이 요건을 충족하지 못하거나 관련 요건 하에 운영되지 못하는 경우, 해당 과세 연도 및 확정된 범위의 모든 이전 과세 연도에 해당 플랜에 따라 이연되고 과거 소득에 포함되지 않은 모든 금액은 현재 연도의 소득에 포함되어야 합니다. 이 금액은 양식 W-2의 박스 1에 기입하는 임금에 포함됩니다. 또한 양식 W-2의 박스 12에 코드 Z를 표시하여 기입합니다.
**서비스를 제공하고 받은 증서.**
귀하가 서비스를 제공한 대가로 고용주로부터 담보 채권을 받은 경우, 해당 채권의 공정 시장 가치 (주로 할인 가격)를 해당 연도의 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 향후 해당 채권에 의한 지불금을 받으면, 각 지불금의 일정 비율은 귀하가 이전에 소득에 포함한 금액의 공정 시장 가치를 회복합니다. 해당 금액을 소득에 포함하지 마십시오. 그 외 나머지 금액을 지급받은 해의 소득에 포함하십시오. 
귀하가 서비스를 제공한 대가로 고용주로부터 양도 불능 무담보 채권을 받은 경우, 원금을 공제한 해당 채권에 의한 지불금은 지급받은 해의 보수 소득입니다.
**퇴직금.**
고용주와의 고용 계약이 종료되어 퇴직금을 받는 경우, 해당 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
_**미사용 연차 수당.**_
귀하가 연방 공무원이고 은퇴 또는 사직 시 미사용 연차 수당을 일시불로 받는 경우, 이 금액은 급여에 포함되어 양식 W-2에 기입됩니다. 
한 기관에서 사직한 후 다른 기관에 재고용되는 경우, 일시불로 받은 미사용 연차 수당 중 일부를 새로 고용된 기관에 상환해야 할 수 있습니다. 이 수당을 받은 동일한 과세 연도에 상환하면 해당 금액만큼 총 급여액을 줄일 수 있습니다. 귀하의 상환을 받은 기관이 발급한 영수증 또는 명세서의 사본을 귀하의 세금 신고서에 첨부하여 세금 신고서 상의 급여와 양식 W-2 상의 급여 간의 차액에 대해 설명하십시오. 
_**전직 서비스.**_
귀하가 퇴직금을 적게 수령하고 대신 전직 서비스 (이력서 작성 및 면접 기술 훈련 등)를 받기로 결정하는 경우, 본래 퇴직금 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**병가 수당.**
귀하에게 질병 또는 상해가 발생했을 때 고용주로부터 받는 지불금은 귀하의 급여 또는 임금의 일부로 간주합니다. 또한, 다음에 해당하는 지급인으로부터 병가 수당 혜택을 받는 경우 귀하의 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 
  * 복지 기금.
  * 주 정부 질병 또는 장애 기금.
  * 고용주 또는 직원 협회.
  * 고용주가 직원을 피보험자로 하여 가입하고 보험료를 내는 보험 회사.


단, 귀하가 상해보험 또는 의료보험 정책에 직접 보험료를 낸 경우, 해당 정책 하에 받은 혜택은 과세 대상이 아닙니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 525, 과세 대상 또는 비과세 대상 소득를 참조하십시오.
**고용주가 지불하는 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금.**
귀하와 고용주 간의 계약 하에 고용주가 귀하의 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금을 납부하고 이 금액을 귀하의 총 급여에서 공제하지 않는 경우, 귀하는 세금 신고서 상에 해당 금액을 과세 대상 급여로 기입하여 신고해야 합니다. 또한 해당 지불금은 급여로 간주되어 귀하의 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금 및 혜택 산정 시 포함됩니다. 단, 귀하가 가사 종사자 또는 농업 종사자인 경우 해당 지불금은 사회 보장 및 메디케어 급여로 간주되지 않습니다.
**주식증가차액청구권.**
고용주가 주식증가차액청구권을 제공하는 경우, 해당 권리를 행사 (사용)하기 전까지는 소득에 포함하지 마십시오. 이 권리를 행사하면 권리 행사일 기준 해당 주식의 공정 시장 가치에서 권리 부여일 기준 공정 시장 가치를 뺀 금액에 상응하는 현금을 지급받게 됩니다. 지급받은 현금은 권리를 행사한 해의 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
#### 복리 후생
귀하가 제공한 서비스의 수행과 연계하여 받은 복리 후생은 보수로서 소득에 포함됩니다. 단, 귀하가 해당 복리 후생의 공정 시장 가치에 준하는 금액을 지급하거나 법적으로 소득에서 제외가 가능한 경우는 예외입니다. 서비스의 수행을 자제하는 것 (예를 들어, 경쟁하지 않기로 계약한 경우)은 해당 규칙의 목적을 위한 서비스의 수행으로 간주합니다.
**회계기간.**
귀하는 고용주가 귀하의 과세 대상 비현금 복리 후생을 신고하기 위해 적용하는 회계기간과 동일한 과세 연도를 적용해야 합니다. 귀하의 고용주는 다음 규칙 중 한 가지를 선택하여 과세 대상 비현금 복리 후생을 신고할 수 있습니다. 
  * 일반 규칙: 일반 연도 전체 (1월 1일 ~ 12월 31일)에 해당하는 혜택을 신고합니다.
  * 특별 회계기간 규칙: 일반 연도 기준으로 마지막 2개월간 (또는 그 이하의 기간 동안) 제공한 혜택은 다음 일반 연도에 제공하는 것으로 간주합니다. 예를 들어, 귀하의 고용주는 매년 지난 해 마지막 2개월과 올해 10월까지의 기간 동안 제공한 혜택의 가치를 신고합니다.


고용주는 모든 복리 후생에 동일한 회계기간을 적용할 필요는 없지만, 특정 혜택을 받는 모든 직원에게는 일괄적으로 동일한 기간을 적용해야 합니다.
귀하도 혜택 신고 시 이와 동일한 회계기간을 적용해야 직원 사업 공제 (차량 사용 등에 대한 공제 등)를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
**양식 W-2.**
고용주는 모든 과세 대상 복리 후생을 임금, 팁 및 기타 보수에 포함하여 양식 W-2, 박스 1에 기입해야 하며, 해당되는 경우 사회 보장 및 메디케어 급여에도 포함하여 박스 3, 박스 5에 기입해야 합니다. 필수 사항은 아니지만, 고용주는 복리 후생의 총액을 박스 14 (또는 별도의 내역서)에 기입합니다. 단, 고용주가 귀하에게 자동차를 제공하고 연간 리스 가격의 100%를 귀하의 소득에 포함시킨 경우, 고용주는 반드시 해당 금액을 박스 14 (또는 별도의 내역서)에 기입하여 귀하에게 알려야 합니다. 
#### 상해보험 또는 의료보험 플랜
대부분의 경우, 고용주가 제공하는 상해보험 또는 의료보험 정책에 따른 보장 금액은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 보험 정책에 따라 제공받는 혜택은 과세 대상이 될 수 있으며, 이에 관해서는 뒤에서 다룰 [_질병 및 상해 수당_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171318 "질병 및 상해 혜택")을 참조하십시오.
장기치료 보장 외에 이 섹션에서 다루는 여러 항목에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 969, ‘의료 저축 계정 및 기타 세금 우대 의료 플랜’을 참조하십시오.
**장기치료 보장.**
귀하의 장기치료 서비스 보장을 위해 고용주가 납입하는 기여금은 일반적으로 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 그러나, 유연적 지출 또는 이와 유사한 계정으로 고용주가 납입하는 기여금은 귀하의 소득에 포함되어야 합니다. 이 금액은 급여로 간주하여 양식 W-2의 박스 1에 기입되어야 합니다.
귀하가 납입하는 기여금에 관해서는 간행물 502, ‘의료 및 치과 비용’에 설명되어 있습니다.
**아처 의료 저축 계정 (MSA) 기여금.**
귀하를 위해 고용주가 분담하는 아처 MSA의 기여금은 일반적으로 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 기여금의 총액은 양식 W-2, 박스 12에 코드 R과 함께 표시됩니다. 그러면 귀하는 해당 금액을 양식 8853, ‘아처 MSA 및 장기치료 의료보험계약’에 기입하십시오. 그리고 해당 양식을 세금 신고서와 함께 제출하시면 됩니다. 
**의료 유연적 지출 계정 (의료 FSA).**
상해보험 또는 의료보험의 조건을 갖춘 의료 FSA를 고용주가 제공하는 경우, 귀하의 급여 중 감액 및 귀하의 의료 비용 변제액은 대부분 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
### 비고.
의료 FSA에는 2012년 이후 시작된 보험 계약을 위한 급여에서 감액되는 기여금의 한도를 적용합니다. 2024년에 시작하는 과세 연도를 기준으로, 의료 FSA를 위한 자발적 직원 급여 감액 기여금에 대한 달러 한도 (물가 상승과 연동)은 $3,200입니다.
**의료 변제 계정 (HRA).**
상해보험 또는 의료보험의 자격이 있는 의료 변제 계정 (HRA)를 고용주가 제공하는 경우, 귀하의 의료 비용 보장액 및 변제액은 대부분 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
**의료 저축 계정 (HSA).**
귀하가 적격 개인인 경우, 귀하 그리고 고용주나 가족 등 다른 사람은 귀하의 의료 저축 계정 (HSA)에 기여금을 납입할 수 있습니다. 고용주 기여금외의 기여금은 귀하가 세금 신고 시 공제 가능하며, 귀하가 항목별 공제를 하는지 여부와는 관계가 없습니다. 고용주가 귀하를 위해 분담한 기여금은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 조건을 갖춘 의료 비용을 지불하기 위한 목적으로 받은 HSA로부터의 인출금은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 조건을 갖춘 의료 비용을 지불하기 위한 목적으로 사용되지 않은 HSA로부터의 인출금은 귀하의 소득에 포함됩니다. HSA 요건에 관한 자세한 사항은 간행물 969를 참조하십시오.
동업 관계 하에 실질적 동업자의 HSA로 분담한 기여금은 고용주가 납입하는 기여금으로 간주되지 않습니다. 이 경우의 기여금은 인출금으로 간주되며, 동업자의 총소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 동업 관계 하에 제공된 서비스와 연계하여 동업자의 HSA로 납입되는 기여금은 보장된 지불금으로 간주되며, 이는 동업자의 총소득에 포함될 수 있습니다. 두 경우 모두, 동업자는 본인의 HSA로 납입되는 기여금을 공제 받을 수 있습니다.
제공된 서비스와 연계하여 2% 주주 겸 직원의 HSA로 S 법인이 납입하는 기여금은 보장된 지불금으로 간주되며, 해당 주주 겸 직원의 총소득에 포함될 수 있습니다. 주주 겸 직원은 본인의 HSA로 납입되는 기여금을 공제 받을 수 있습니다.
_**유자격 HSA 자금 인출.**_
귀하는 귀하의 개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA)에서 HSA로 일회성 인출을 실행할 수 있으며, 일반적으로 이 인출금은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.

귀하의 적격 자녀 입양과 관련된 유자격 입양 비용을 위해 고용주에게서 받은 금액 또는 고용주에 의해 발생한 비용은 귀하의 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 양식 8839, ‘적격 입양 비용’의 지침을 참조하십시오.
고용주는 귀하에게 제공한 입양 수당을 양식 W-2, 박스 12에 코드 T로 표시하여 신고합니다. 해당 금액은 사회 보장 및 메디케어 급여에도 포함되어 박스 3, 박스 5에 기입됩니다. 단, 박스 1의 급여에는 포함되지 않습니다. 과세 대상 및 제외 대상 금액을 결정하려면 양식 8839의 파트 III을 작성해야 합니다. 그리고 해당 양식을 세금 신고서와 함께 제출하시면 됩니다.
#### 최소 허용 혜택
고용주가 귀하에게 제공하는 특정 상품 또는 서비스의 가격이 너무 낮아 고용주가 해당 금액을 처리하는 것이 비합리적인 수준인 경우, 일반적으로 해당 금액은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 대부분의 경우, 직장 구내 식당에서 받은 할인 금액, 초과 근무 시 귀가 교통비, 직장 야유회 혜택을 소득에 포함하지 마십시오.
**명절 선물.**
크리스마스나 기타 공휴일에 액면가의 칠면조, 햄, 기타 물품을 고용주로부터 제공받은 경우, 해당 선물의 가액을 귀하의 소득에 포함하지 마십시오. 그러나 고용주에게서 현금 또는 현금등가액을 받은 경우, 해당 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
#### 교육 지원
고용주가 제공하는 적격 교육 지원 비용은 최대 $5,250까지 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 970, ‘교육에 대한 세금 혜택’을 참조하십시오.
#### 단체 정기 생명보험
대부분의 경우, 고용주 (또는 전 고용주)가 제공하는 단체 정기 생명보험 보장 금액은 최대 $50,000까지 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 그러나, 고용주가 제공하는 보험의 보장 금액에서 귀하가 해당 보험 상품에 지불한 금액을 차감한 최종 보장 금액이 $50,000를 초과하는 경우, 해당 초과 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
예외 조건에 관한 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_전액 제외_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171262 "전액 제외.") 및 [_전액 과세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171263 "전액 과세.")를 참조하십시오.
고용주가 $50,000를 초과하는 보장 금액을 제공한 경우, 해당 금액은 귀하의 소득에 포함되며 급여의 일부로서 양식 W-2의 박스 1에 기입되어야 합니다. 또한, 박스 12에도 코드 C로 표시하여 기입해야 합니다.
**단체 정기 생명보험.**
이 유형의 보험은 기간성 생명보험 (일정 기간에 한해 보장되는 보험)으로서 다음 사항을 보장합니다. 
  * 일반 사망 보험금 제공
  * 직원 단체를 대상으로 보장
  * 고용주가 제시하는 정책에 따라 보장
  * 개인별 차등을 방지하기 위해 정해진 공식에 따라 각 직원에게 보험금 지급.


_**영구 혜택.**_
귀하의 단체 정기 생명보험이 완납 또는 현금 해지환급금 등 영구 혜택을 보장하는 경우, 귀하는 영구 혜택의 금액에서 귀하가 지불한 금액을 제외한 최종 금액을 급여의 일부로 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 고용주는 귀하가 소득에 포함할 수 있도록 해당 금액을 고지해주어야 합니다. 
_**재해 사망 보험금.**_
재해 사망 또는 기타 사망 보험금을 보장하지만 일반 사망 보험금 (여행 보험 등)은 보장하지 않는 보험은 단체 정기 생명보험이 아닙니다.
**전 고용주.**
귀하의 전 고용주가 해당 연도에 단체 정기 생명보험을 통해 $50,000를 초과하는 보장 금액을 제공한 경우, 귀하는 해당 금액을 소득에 포함하여 급여의 일부로서 양식 W-2, 박스 1에 기입하여 신고해야 합니다. 또한, 박스 12에도 코드 C로 표시하여 기입해야 합니다. 박스 12에는 초과 보장 금액에 대한 미납 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금도 코드 M과 N으로 표시하여 기입해야 합니다. 귀하는 소득세 신고 시 이 세금들을 납부해야 합니다. 이 세금 항목들을 스케줄 2 (양식 1040), 라인 13에 기입하십시오.

#### 은퇴 연금 플랜 서비스
일반적으로, 고용주가 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜을 통해 귀하 및 귀하의 배우자에게 제공하는 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜 플랜 서비스의 가액은 소득에 포함하지 마십시오. 은퇴 연금 플랜 자문, 고용주가 제공하는 은퇴 연금 플랜 정보, 고용주가 제공하는 플랜이 귀하의 개인 은퇴 연금 소득 플랜에 알맞은지에 관한 정보 등이 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에 포함됩니다. 고용주가 제공하는 세금 신고서 작성 서비스, 회계 서비스, 법적 서비스, 또는 중개인 서비스의 가액은 제외할 수 없습니다.

#### 은퇴 연금 플랜 기여금
고용주가 귀하를 위해 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에 분담하는 기여금은 납입 당시에는 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. (고용주는 은퇴 연금 플랜의 적격 여부를 귀하에게 확인시켜 줄 수 있습니다.) 그러나, 해당 플랜에 포함된 생명보험에 따른 보장 금액은 소득에 포함해야 할 수 있습니다. 앞서 다룬 _복리 후생_ 섹션의 [_단체 정기 생명보험_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171247 "단체 정기 생명보험")을 참조하십시오.

**선택적 이연.**
귀하가 특정 유형의 은퇴 연금 플랜의 보장을 받는 경우, 고용주가 납입한 보수의 일부를 귀하가 직접 지급받는 대신 특정 은퇴 기금에 입금하기로 결정할 수 있습니다. 이 방식으로 확보하는 금액 (“선택적 이연”이라 지칭)은 유자격 플랜에 대한 고용주의 기여금으로 간주합니다. 지정된 Roth 기여금 (뒤에서 다룸)이 아닌 선택적 이연 금액은 납입 당시에는 소득세 과세 대상 급여에 포함되지 않습니다. 대신, 해당 플랜에서 인출하는 시기에 소득세 과세 대상이 됩니다. 그러나, 납입 당시 사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금 대상 급여에는 포함됩니다.
선택적 이연 금액에는 다음 은퇴 연금 플랜에 대한 선택적 기여금이 포함됩니다. 
  1. 현금 또는 이연 계정 (섹션 401(k) 플랜). 
  2. 연방 공무원의 절약형 저축 플랜. 
  3. 간소화된 직원 급여 차감 연금 플랜 (SARSEP).

_**적격 자동 기여 계정.**_
적격 자동 기여 계정에서는 고용주가 귀하를 섹션 401(k) 플랜에 입금된 보수의 일부를 소유할 수 있도록 선택된 것으로 간주할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 해당 적격 자동 기여 계정에 따른 귀하의 자격 및 의무에 대해 서면 통지를 받을 수 있습니다. 통지는 다음 사항을 안내해야 합니다.
  * 선택적 기여를 하지 않거나 다른 비율로 입금된 기여를 하도록 선택할 권리
  * 귀하가 투자 결정을 내리지 않는 경우 입금된 기여금의 투자 방식.


귀하는 해당 통지를 받고 첫 선택적 기여를 하기 전까지 기여금에 대한 결정을 내리기 위한 합리적인 기간을 보장받을 수 있습니다. 
_**총 이연 한도.**_
2024년에 대해 대부분의 경우 상단의 (1)~(3)과 (5)에 제시된 플랜에 따라 귀하가 이연한 기여금 총액이 $23,000을 초과하지 않아야 합니다. SIMPLE 플랜의 한도는 $16,000입니다. 섹션 501(c)(18)(D) 플랜의 한도는 $7,000 또는 보수의 25% 중 더 적은 금액입니다. 섹션 457 플랜의 한도는 포함 대상 보수 또는 $23,000 중 더 적은 금액입니다. 특정 플랜 한도에 따라 이연된 금액은 총 이연 한도의 일부입니다.
_**지정된 Roth 기여금.**_
섹션 401(k) 플랜, 섹션 403(b) 플랜 및 정부 섹션 457 플랜에 납입하는 고용주는 적격 Roth 기여금 프로그램을 형성하여 귀하가 세후 Roth 기여금으로 지정된 해당 플랜의 선택적 이연 금액 일부 또는 전부를 가질 것인지 선택하도록 할 수 있습니다. 지정된 Roth 기여금은 선택적 이연 금액으로 간주되며, 납입 시 소득에 포함된 경우는 제외입니다.
_**초과 이연.**_
고용주 또는 플랜 관리자는 귀하의 플랜 기여금을 산정할 때 적절한 연간 한도를 적용해야 합니다. 그러나, 귀하는 귀하가 이연하는 금액이 총 이연 한도를 초과하지 않도록 총액을 관리할 책임이 있습니다.
한도를 초과하는 금액을 이연하여 확보하는 경우, 지정된 Roth 기여금의 초과 이연이 있는 경우를 제외하고 초과 금액은 일반적으로 귀하의 해당 연도 소득에 포함되어야 합니다. 초과 이연 금액의 세무 처리에 대한 설명은 간행물 525를 참조하십시오. 
_**만회 기여금.**_
해당 과세 연도 말일 기준으로 귀하가 만 50세 이상인 경우 만회 기여금 (추가 선택적 이연)이 허용됩니다. 
#### 주식 옵션
귀하가 서비스를 제공한 대가로 주식 또는 기타 재산을 매매할 수 있는 법에 규제되지 않는 주식 옵션을 받은 경우, 해당 권리를 부여받을 때, 해당 권리를 행사할 때 (권리를 행사하여 주식 또는 기타 재산을 매매), 또는 해당 권리를 매도하거나 처분할 때 소득이 발생합니다. 그러나 귀하의 주식 옵션이 법의 규제를 받는 경우, 귀하가 해당 주식을 매도 또는 교환하기 전까지 소득이 발생하지 않습니다. 고용주는 귀하의 주식 옵션이 어떤 유형인지 확인시켜줄 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 525를 참조하십시오.
#### 조건부 자산
대부분의 경우, 귀하가 서비스를 제공한 대가로 조건부 자산을 받은 경우, 지급받은 해에 해당 자산의 공정 시장 가치를 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 그러나 가액에 영향을 미치는 특정 조건이 있는 주식 또는 기타 재산을 받은 경우, 해당 재산에 대한 확정 권리가 발생하기 전까지는 해당 가액은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. (귀하는 해당 재산이 귀하에게 이전되는 해에 해당 재산의 가액을 소득에 포함할 것인지 선택할 수 있습니다.) 자세한 정보는 간행물 525의 _조건부 자산_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**조건부 주식에 따른 배당금.**
조건부 주식에 따라 지급받은 배당금은 보수로 간주하며 배당금 소득으로 간주하지 않습니다. 고용주는 이 금액을 양식 W-2에 포함해야 합니다. 
_**귀하가 소득에 포함하기로 결정한 주식.**_
귀하가 조건부 주식에 따라 지급받은 배당금 중 귀하에게 이전된 해에 소득에 포함하기로 결정한 배당금은 기타 배당금과 동일하게 취급됩니다. 세금 신고 시 해당 금액을 배당금으로 신고하십시오. 배당금에 관한 설명은 간행물 550, 투자 소득 및 비용을 참조하십시오. 
양식 W-2 및 양식 1099-DIV 상에서 배당금 처리 방법에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 525의 _조건부 자산에 따른 배당금_ 을 참조하십시오.

#### 성직자
귀하가 성직자인 경우, 일반적으로 주례, 세례, 장례, 미사 등을 통해 받은 제물 및 요금을 귀하의 급여에 포함해야 합니다. 헌금이 종교 시설에게 공된 경우, 귀하에게 과세되지 않습니다.
귀하가 종교 단체의 회원으로서 외부 소득을 해당 종교 단체에 제공하는 경우에도 귀하는 해당 소득을 귀하의 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 단, 귀하가 종교 단체에 지불한 금액은 자선목적의 기부금 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 간행물 526을 참조하십시오.
**은퇴 연금.**
성직자의 은퇴 연금 또는 퇴직금은 일반적으로 다른 은퇴 연금 또는 연금과 동일하게 취급됩니다. 해당 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 5a과 라인 5b에 신고하십시오. 
**주택.**
성직자의 경우 주택에 관한 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이 규칙에 따라 귀하가 급여의 일부로 받은 주택 임대 가격 (공공요금 포함) 또는 지정된 주택 수당을 귀하의 소득에 포함하지 않습니다. 그러나, 귀하가 제공하는 서비스에 상응하는 합리적 가액을 초과하는 금액은 제외할 수 없습니다. 귀하가 직접 공공요금을 지불하는 경우, 실제 사용 금액에 한해 공공요금용으로 지정된 수당을 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 주택 또는 주택 수당은 임명된 또는 공인 자격이 있는 성직자로서 귀하가 제공하는 서비스에 대한 보수이어야 합니다. 그러나 귀하가 자영업세 과세 대상인 경우, 주택 임대 가격 또는 주택 수당을 자영업 소득으로 포함하여 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)에 기입해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 517, ‘성직자 및 종교 종사자를 위한 사회 보장 및 기타 정보’를 참조하십시오. 
#### 종교 단체 일원
귀하가 청빈 서원을 한 종교 단체의 일원인 경우, 권리를 포기하고 종교 단체에 인도한 소득을 어떻게 처리할 것인지는 귀하가 해당 단체에 서비스를 제공하는지 여부에 따라 달라집니다.
**종교 단체를 위한 서비스 수행.**
귀하가 종교 단체의 대리인으로서 해당 단체가 요구하는 의무를 수행하기 위해 서비스를 제공하는 경우, 해당 단체에 인도한 소득을 귀하의 소득에 포함하지 마십시오.
해당 단체가 귀하에게 상급 교회의 다른 기관 또는 관련 기관에 서비스를 수행하도록 지시한 경우, 귀하는 해당 단체의 대리인으로서 서비스를 수행하는 것으로 간주합니다. 종교 단체의 대리인으로서 임금을 받고 해당 단체에 인도한 경우, 해당 소득은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 
**예시.**
귀하는 교회의 일원이며 청빈 서원을 했습니다. 귀하는 모든 소득에 대한 권리를 포기하고 급여 또는 임금을 귀하가 속한 교회에 인도합니다. 귀하는 공인 간호사이며, 교회는 귀하에게 관련 기관인 병원에서 근무하도록 지시합니다. 그러나 귀하는 여전히 교회의 일반 지시와 통제를 받습니다. 귀하는 교회의 대리인으로 간주되며, 귀하가 병원에서 받아 교회에 인도하는 모든 임금은 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
**종교 단체 외부에서의 서비스 수행.**
귀하가 종교 단체 외부에서 서비스를 수행하도록 지시를 받은 경우, 귀하의 서비스는 다음 사항을 모두 충족하지 않는 이상 종교 단체의 지시에 따른 의무 수행이 아닙니다.

#### 일반 정보
여기에서 일반 이자의 일부 항목에 대해 설명합니다.
.![This is an Image: files.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/files.gif)**기록 보관.**_귀하가 해당 연도에 얻은 이자 소득의 출처 및 금액을 증빙하는 명세서를 보관해야 합니다. 또한, 이자 소득을 명시하는 양식 (예시, 양식 1099-INT)은 귀하가 보관해야 할 기록물 중 중요한 부분이므로 수령하여 잘 보관해야 합니다._.
**특정 자녀의 불로소득에 대한 세금.**
2024년에 자녀에게 발생한 불로소득 중 일부는 부모의 세율을 기준으로 과세 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 양식 8615을 작성하여 자녀의 세금 신고서에 첨부하십시오. 이에 해당하지 않는 경우 양식 8615를 작성하지 않아도 되며, 자녀의 소득은 해당 자녀의 세율을 기준으로 과세 대상이 됩니다. 
부모는 자녀가 받은 이자 및 배당금을 부모의 세금 신고서에 포함하기로 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 양식 8814를 사용하십시오. 
자녀의 불로소득에 대한 세금 및 부모의 선택에 관한 자세한 정보는 [양식 8615(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8615)를 참조하십시오. 
**상속 재산 또는 신탁의 수혜자.**
상속 재산 또는 신탁의 수혜자로서 받는 이자는 일반적으로 과세 대상 소득입니다. 이 경우 수탁자로부터 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1041)을 수령하게 됩니다. 수령한 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1041) 및 지침을 보면 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에서 어느 항목에 해당 소득을 신고해야 하는지 알 수 있습니다. 
**납세자 식별 번호 (TIN).**
연방 세법에 따라 지정된 제출처에 귀하의 이름과 납세자 식별 번호 (사회 보장 번호 (SSN), 고용주 식별 번호 (EIN), 입양 납세자 식별 번호 (ATIN), 또는 개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN) 중 하나를 제공하여 귀하에게 해당되는 신고서, 내역서, 또는 기타 서류를 제출할 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 제출처에는 이자 지급인이 포함됩니다. 이자 지급인에게 귀하의 납세자 식별 번호를 제공하지 않을 경우, 일반적으로 지급인에게 이자 지급금에 대해 24%의 세율로 예비 원천징수가 요구될 것이며 과징금의 대상이 될 수도 있습니다. 양식 W-9를 사용해 필요한 정보를 제공하십시오. 양식 W-9와 이에 대한 지침을 참조하십시오.
_**공동 계좌의 TIN.**_
일반적으로 공동 계좌의 자금이 한 사람의 소유인 경우, 계좌에 해당인의 이름을 먼저 기재하고 해당인의 납세자 식별 번호를 지급인에게 제공하십시오. (공동 계좌의 소유인에 관한 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_공동 계좌_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171418 "공동 계좌.")를 참조하십시오.) 공동 계좌에 공동 운영 자금이 있는 경우, 계좌에 이름이 가장 먼저 기재된 사람의 납세자 식별 번호를 제공하십시오.
이 규칙은 부부의 공동 소유 계좌 및 기타 개인들의 공동 소유 계좌에 모두 동일하게 적용됩니다. 예를 들어, 자녀 소유의 자금을 귀하와 자녀의 공동 저축 계좌에 보유하는 경우, 계좌에 자녀의 이름을 먼저 기재하고 자녀의 납세자 식별 번호를 제공하십시오. 
양식 W-9과 이에 대한 지침은 다음을 제공합니다: 만약 이 양식 W-9가 공동 계좌에 대한 것이라면 (해외 금융 기관 (FFI)에 의해 유지되는 계좌가 아닌), 양식 W-9, Part I에 입력한 번호를 소유한 사람의 이름 혹은 설립체의 이름을 기재한 다음 동그라미를 치십시오. 공동 계좌를 기록할 목적으로 양식 W-9을 FFI에 제공한다면, 미국인인 각각 소유자는 반드시 양식 W-9을 제공해야합니다. 양식 W-9와 이에 대한 지침을 참조하십시오.
_**자녀를 위한 관리인 계좌.**_
자녀의 관리인로서 귀하의 이름이 기록된 계좌의 실 소유자가 자녀인 경우, 자녀의 납세자 식별 번호를 지급인에게 제공하십시오. 예를 들어, 계좌의 소유자가 자녀인 경우 해당 계좌의 이자가 관리인인 귀하에게 지급되더라도 자녀의 사회 보장 번호를 이자 지급인에게 제공하십시오. 
_**납세자 식별 번호 미제공 과징금.**_
이자 지급인에게 귀하의 납세자 식별 번호를 제공하지 않으면 과징금이 부과될 수도 있습니다. 1장의 _과징금_ 에 있는 [_SSN 미제공_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170731 "SSN 미제공.")을 참조하십시오. 예비 원천징수도 적용될 수 있습니다. 
**예비 원천징수.**
이자 소득은 일반적으로 일반 원천징수 대상이 아닙니다. 그러나, 해당 소득에 대한 소득세를 징수하기 위해 예비 원천징수의 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 예비 원천징수 시, 이자 지급인은 해당 이자 소득에 적절한 원천징수율을 적용하여 소득세를 원천징수합니다. 현재 세율을 24%입니다. TIN 미제공 또는 위증의 처벌 아래 TIN의 증명 실패와 같은 예비 원천징수의 조건이 존재할때만 원천징수가 요구됩니다.
IRS가 귀하의 이자 또는 배당금 소득이 과소신고되었다고 판단하는 경우에도 예비 원천징수가 적용될 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 4장의 [_예비 원천징수_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032380 "예비 원천징수")를 참조하십시오. 
_**예비 원천징수 신고.**_
귀하의 이자 소득에서 예비 원천징수가 차감된 경우, 원천징수된 금액은 양식 1099–INT에 신고될 것입니다. 양식 1099-INT에는 “Federal income tax withheld” (원천징수된 연방 소득세)를 위한 예비 원천징수 금액이 표시됩니다. 
**공동 계좌.**
2명 이상이 공동 소유자, 전체 공동 소유자, 또는 공유 재산권자 등의 신분으로 자산 (저축 계좌 또는 채권)을 소유하는 경우, 지역별 법률에 따라 해당 자산의 이자에서 각각의 지분이 정해집니다. 
**자녀에게 증여된 자산에 따른 소득.**
미성년자에게 증권 증여법 (Model Gifts of Securities to Minors Act), 미성년자에게 증여법 (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act), 또는 기타 유사 법률에 따라 귀하가 부모로서 자녀에게 증여한 자산은 자녀 소유의 자산이 됩니다. 
해당 자산에서 발생한 소득은 자녀 이름의 과세 대상 소득입니다. 단, 해당 자녀를 양육하는 법적 의무를 충족하기 위해 사용된 부분은 해당 의무를 가진 부모 또는 보호자 이름의 과세 대상 소득이 될 수 있습니다. 
_**부모가 수탁자인 저축 계좌.**_
미성년 자녀를 위해 개설했으나 수탁자인 부모의 이름 하에 관리되는 저축 계좌에서 이자 소득이 발생하는 경우, 해당 자녀가 거주하는 주의 법률에 따라 다음 조건에 모두 해당하는 경우 자녀 이름의 과세 대상 소득이 됩니다. 
  * 저축 계좌가 법적으로 자녀 소유인 경우.
  * 자녀를 양육하기 위해 해당 자금을 사용할 법적 권리가 부모에게 부여되지 않은 경우. 


**양식 1099-INT.**
일반적으로 은행이나 저축, 대출 및 기타 이자의 지급인이 양식 1099-INT 또는 유사 명세서를 통해 귀하에게 이자 소득을 고지합니다. 이 양식에는 해당 연도에 귀하가 얻은 이자 소득을 표시합니다. 이 양식을 기록용으로 보관해야 합니다. 이 양식을 세금 신고서에 첨부할 필요는 없습니다. 
해당 과세 연도에 귀하가 얻은 총 이자 소득을 세금 신고서에 기입하십시오. 양식 1099-INT의 지침을 통해 귀하에게 고지된 금액 중 조정이 필요한 부분이 있는지 확인하십시오. 
_**양식 1099-INT에 보고되지 않은 이자.**_
양식 1099-INT를 수령하지 않더라도 귀하의 총 이자 소득을 신고해야 합니다. 예를 들어, 파트너쉽 또는 S 법인에서 배분 비율에 따른 이자를 지급받을 수 있습니다. 이 이자는 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065) 또는 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1120-S)을 통해 귀하에게 보고됩니다.
_**지명인.**_
일반적으로 귀하의 지명인이 이자를 지급받는 경우, 해당 지명인은 귀하에게 양식 1099-INT를 전달하여 귀하 대신 지급받은 이자를 고지해야 합니다. 
귀하가 양식 1099-INT 및 이자를 지명인으로서 수령하는 경우, 지명인 배분에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 1장에 있는 _이자 소득 신고 방법_ 또는 스케줄 B (양식 1040) 지침을 참조하십시오.
_**부정확한 금액.**_
양식 1099-INT에 표시된 금액이나 기타 정보가 부정확한 경우, 발행자에게 정정된 양식을 요청해야 합니다. 새 양식 1099-INT에는 “CORRECTED” (정정) 박스에 체크 표시가 되어있어야 합니다.
**양식 1099-OID.**
신고 대상 이자 소득은 양식 1099-OID, 최초 발행 할인에도 표시됩니다. 이 양식에 표시된 금액에 관한 자세한 정보는 이 장의 뒤에서 다룰 [_최초 발행 할인 (OID)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171525 "최초 발행 할인 \(OID\)")을 참조하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_아래에 설명된 박스의 언급은 2024년 1월 개정판 양식 1099-INT 및 양식 1099-DIV가 출처입니다. 미래 재개정판에는 다른 박스가 언급될 수도 있습니다._.
**면세 이자 배당금.**
뮤추얼 펀드 기금이나 기타 regulated investment company (RIC) (규제된 투자회사)로부터 받은 면세 이자 배당금은 귀하의 과세 대상 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. (그러나, 다음에서 다룰 _정보 신고 요건_ 를 참조하십시오.) 면세 이자 배당금은 양식 1099-DIV의 박스 12에 표시되어야 합니다. 귀하의 면세 이자 배당금 배분 기준을 줄이지 마십시오.
_**정보 신고 요건.**_
면세 이자 배당금은 과세 대상이 아니지만, 신고할 필요가 있다면 귀하의 세금 신고서에 기입해야 합니다. 이는 정보 제공 요건이며, 이로 인해 해당 면세 이자 배당금이 과세 대상 소득이 되지 않습니다. 
### 비고.
명시된 사적사업채권에 대해 뮤츄얼 펀드 또는 기타 RIC이 지급한 면세 이자 배당금은 대체 최저세 (AMT)의 대상이 될 수 있습니다. AMT의 대상이 되는 면세 이자 배당금은 양식 1099–DIV의 박스 13에 기재될 것입니다. 자세한 정보는 13장의 [_대체 최저세 (AMT)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000174222 "대체 최저세 \(AMT\)")를 참조하십시오. 간행물 550, 1장에는 _주 또는 지방 정부 채권_ 하의 민간사업채권에 관한 설명이 있습니다.
**VA 배당금 이자.**
재향군인부 (VA)에 적립된 보험 배당금의 이자는 과세 대상이 아닙니다. 여기에는 전환된 미국정부생명보험 및 국가생명보험 정책 하의 배당금에 대한 이자를 포함합니다. 
**개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA).**
Roth IRA에 따른 이자는 일반적으로 과세 대상이 아닙니다. 전통적 IRA에 따른 이자는 이연 세금입니다. 일반적으로 IRA에서 발생한 이자는 인출하지 않는 이상 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. [9장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172558 "개인 퇴직 계정 \(IRA\)")을 참조하십시오. 
#### 과세 대상 이자-일반
은행 계좌, 다른 사람에게 제공한 대출 및 기타 출처에 따른 이자가 과세 대상 이자에 포함됩니다. 과세 대상 이자의 출처는 다음과 같습니다.
**사실상 이자인 배당금.**
흔히 배당금이라고 칭하는 특정 배분 수익은 사실상 이자입니다. 다음 출처의 예치금 또는 주식 계좌에서 발생한 소위 배당금인 이자는 신고해야 합니다. 
  * 협동조합은행
  * 신용협동조합
  * 국내 주택대부조합
  * 국내 저축대부조합
  * 연방 저축대부조합
  * 상호저축은행. 


이러한 “배당금”은 양식 1099-INT에 이자 소득으로 기입되어야 합니다.
**단기금융펀드.**
단기금융펀드는 뮤추얼 펀드 기금 및 증권중개회사 등 비은행 금융 기관이 운영하며 배당금을 지급합니다. 일반적으로 단기금융펀드에서 발생한 소득은 이자가 아니라 배당금으로 신고되어야 합니다. 
**예금증서 및 기타 이연 이자 계좌.**
예금증서 혹은 이연 이자 계좌를 개설하는 경우, 계좌 기간 동안 1년 또는 그 이하의 고정 간격으로 이자가 지급됩니다. 귀하가 이러한 이자를 실제로 지급받거나 위약금 없이 지급받을 자격이 되는 경우, 해당 이자는 반드시 일반적으로 소득에 포함됩니다. 1년 또는 그 이하의 기간에 만기가 되며 만기 시 이자를 일괄 지급하는 계좌에도 동일한 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이자가 1년 이상 이연되는 경우, 뒤에서 다룰 [_최초 발행 할인 (OID)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171525 "최초 발행 할인 \(OID\)")을 참조하십시오. 
_**중도 인출에 따른 위약금 대상 이자.**_
이연 이자 계좌에서 만기 이전에 자금을 중도 인출하는 경우, 위약금을 지불해야 할 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 위약금을 차감하지 않고 해당 연도에 지급받거나 계좌에 입금된 이자의 총액을 신고해야 합니다. 이자 신고 및 위약금 차감에 관한 자세한 사항은 간행물 550, 1장에 있는 _예금 중도 인출 위약금_ 을 참조하십시오. 
_**예금증서 투자 목적의 대출금.**_
금융 기관의 예금증서에서 요구하는 최소 예금을 충족하기 위해 은행 또는 저축기관에서 대출한 금액에 대한 이자 비용과 해당 예금증서를 통해 얻은 이자는 별개의 항목입니다. 예금증서를 통해 얻은 총 이자 소득을 귀하의 소득에 포함하여 신고하십시오. 항목별 공제를 적용하는 경우, 최대 순 투자 소득 금액만큼 귀하가 지불한 이자 비용을 투자 이자로서 공제받을 수 있습니다. 간행물 550, 3장의 _이자 비용_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**예시.**
귀하는 은행에서 $5,000을 빌리고 귀하의 돈 $5,000을 더해 $10,000의 예금증서를 구매했습니다. 2024년 예금증서 만기일에 $575를 벌었지만, 해당 금액에서 귀하가 대출한 $5,000에 대한 이자인 $310를 차감한 $265만 실제로 지급받았습니다. 이 경우, 은행은 2024년에 대한 양식 1099-INT에 귀하가 얻은 이자 $575를 표시합니다. 또한, 2024년에 귀하가 지불한 이자 $310가 표시된 명세서도 전달합니다. 이러한 경우 귀하는 $575를 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 항목별 공제를 적용하는 경우, 순 투자 소득 한도 적용 대상인 $310를 공제받을 수 있습니다.
**계좌 개설 혜택.**
저축 기관으로부터 예금 예치 또는 계좌 개설에 대한 비현금 혜택 또는 서비스를 받은 경우, 해당 가액을 이자로 신고해야 할 수 있습니다. 
예금이 $5,000 미만인 경우, $10를 초과하는 혜택 또는 서비스는 이자로 신고해야 합니다. 예금이 $5,000 이상인 경우, $20를 초과하는 혜택 또는 서비스는 이자로 신고해야 합니다. 혜택 또는 서비스의 가액은 해당 금융 기관이 부담하는 비용에 따라 결정됩니다. 
**예시.**
귀하는 지역 은행에서 저축 계좌를 개설하고 $800를 예치합니다. 해당 계좌를 통해 $20의 이자가 발생합니다. 또한 $15 가액의 계산기를 받습니다. 그 외에 해당 연도에 계좌에 입금된 다른 이자가 없는 경우, 양식 1099-INT에 기입될 해당 연도 이자 소득은 $35입니다. 귀하는 세금 신고서에 이자 소득으로 $35를 기입해야 합니다. 
**보험 배당금 이자.**
매년 인출 가능한 보험 회사 계좌에 입금된 보험 배당금에 따른 이자는 입금된 해의 과세 대상입니다. 단, 계약해당일 (또는 기타 명시된 일자)에만 인출 가능한 경우, 이자는 해당 일자가 속하는 연도에 과세 대상이 됩니다. 
**선불 보험료.**
선불 보험료, 선지급 보험료, 또는 보험료 예금 펀드 등의 가치가 증가했을 때, 보험 정책에 따른 보험료 지급에 해당 금액을 이용하거나 해당 금액을 인출할 수 있는 경우 해당 금액은 이자로 간주됩니다. 
**미국 정부 채권.**
미국 정부 기관 및 대행 기관이 발행한 미국 재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권 등 정부 채권에 따른 이자는 연방 소득세 과세 대상입니다. 
**세금 환급금 이자.**
세금 환급금의 이자는 과세 대상 소득입니다. 
**보상금 이자.**
정부 기관이 보상 지연에 따른 이자를 지급하는 경우, 해당 이자는 과세 대상입니다. 
**할부 매매 지불금.**
자산의 매각 또는 교환 계약에 따라 후불로 지급되는 금액이 있는 경우, 대부분 해당 금액에 대한 이자도 발생합니다. 일반적으로 이러한 이자는 지급받을 때 과세 대상이 됩니다. 후불 지급 계약에 따른 이자가 없거나 매우 적은 금액인 경우, 각 지불금의 일부가 이자로 취급될 수 있습니다. 간행물 537을 참조하십시오. 
**연금 계약 이자.**
만기 이전에 처분한 연금 계약에 따른 누적 이자는 과세 대상입니다. 
**고리대금 이자.**
고리대금 이자는 법정이율이 아닌 수준의 이율을 말합니다. 이 경우, 주 법에 따라 해당 이자가 자동으로 원금에 대한 지불금으로 전환되지 않는 이상 이에 따른 이자는 과세 대상입니다. 
**동결된 예금에 따른 이자 소득.**
동결된 예금에 따른 이자는 총소득에서 제외하십시오. 다음 이유로 인해 연말에 예금의 일부를 인출할 수 없다면 동결된 예금으로 간주합니다. 
  * 해당 금융 기관이 파산하거나 지불 불능 상태 또는 이렇게 될 가능성이 있는 경우
  * 해당 금융 기관의 관할 주정부에서 해당 주의 다른 금융 기관이 파산 또는 지불 불능 상태가 되어 예금 인출이 제한된 경우.


동결된 예금에 입금되는 이자는 소득에서 제외되며, 이때 다음 금액의 합은 차감합니다. 
  * 해당 연도에 해당 계좌에서 인출한 순 금액.
  * 해당 연도 말에 인출 가능했을 금액 (정기 예금의 중도 인출로 인한 위약금이 차감되지 않은 금액).


2024년 말 기준으로 동결된 예금에 대한 이자 소득을 표기한 양식 1099-INT를 수령하는 경우, 이러한 이자 소득을 세금 신고 시 제외하는 법에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 550, 1장의 _How To Report Interest Income_ (이자 소득 신고 방법)의 _Frozen deposits_ (동결된 예금)을 참조하십시오. 
여기서 제외하는 금액은 다음 연도에 계좌에 입금되는 것으로 간주됩니다. 해당 금액은 인출하는 해에 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**예시.**
해당 연도에 귀하의 동결된 예금에 $100의 이자가 입금되었습니다. 귀하는 $80를 인출했으나, 해당 연도에 그 이상의 금액은 인출이 불가능했습니다. 귀하는 해당 연도에 $80를 소득에 포함시키고, $20는 소득에서 제외해야 합니다. $20는 귀하가 실제로 인출하는 해에 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**균일 가격 거래 채권.**
이자가 체납되거나 누적된 후 아직 미납인 상태로 할인 가격에 채권을 매입하는 경우, 해당 채권은 균일 가격에 거래된 채권이라 칭합니다. 체납 또는 미납된 이자는 소득이 아니며, 이후 지급되더라도 이자로서 과세 대상이 되지 않습니다. 해당 이자를 지급받으면, 귀하가 소유한 채권의 잔여 기초 비용을 차감하는 자금의 환급입니다. 그러나, 매입 이후 누적된 이자는 해당 이자가 누적되거나 지급받은 연도의 과세 대상 이자 소득입니다. 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_이자 지급일 사이에 매각된 채권_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171519 "이자 지급일 사이에 매각된 채권")을 참조하십시오. 
**시장 이자율 이하 대출.**
일반적으로 “시장 이자율 이하 대출”은 (a) 증여 혹은 콜론의 경우에 대출에 대한 이자율이 해당 연방 이자율보다 낮은 경우, 혹은 (b) 기간대출의 경우, 대출받은 금액이 대출의 총 상환금에 대한 현가를 (해당 연방 이자율과 같은 할인율을 사용한) 초과하는 것입니다. (자세한 내용은 국세법 섹션 7872를 참조하십시오.) 섹션 7872는 증여성 대출, 보수 관련 대출, 법인-주주 대출을 비롯한 특정 시장 이자율 이하 대출에 적용됩니다. (국세법 섹션 7872(c) 참조.) 귀하가 시장 이자율 이하 대출자라면 추가적인 이자 소득이 발생했을 수도 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 550의 1장, _Below-Market Loans_ (시장이율이하 대출)을 참조하십시오. 
#### 미국 저축 채권
이 섹션에서는 미국 저축 채권에 관한 세금 정보를 설명합니다. 미국 저축 채권에서 발생한 이자 소득을 신고하는 방법과 이러한 채권의 이전을 취급하는 방법을 설명합니다.
현재 개인들에게 제공되는 미국 저축 채권에는 시리즈 EE 채권과 시리즈 I 채권이 있습니다.

**발생주의 회계처리 방법 납세자.**
귀하가 발생주의 회계처리 방법을 이용하는 경우, 미국 저축 채권에서 발생한 이자는 발생한 연도에 신고해야 합니다. 실제로 이자를 지급받는 일자나 채권 만기일까지 이자 신고를 연기할 수 없습니다. 발생주의 회계처리 방법은 1장의 [_회계처리 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170553 "회계처리 방법")에 설명되어 있습니다. 
**현금주의 회계처리 방법 납세자.**
귀하가 대부분의 개인 납세자처럼 현금주의 회계처리 방법을 이용하는 경우, 미국 저축 채권에서 발생한 이자는 실제로 이자를 지급받는 연도에 신고해야 합니다. 현금주의 회계처리 방법은 1장의 [_회계처리 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170553 "회계처리 방법")에 설명되어 있습니다. 단, 뒤에서 다룰 [_현금주의 회계처리 방법 납세자를 위한 세금 신고 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171468 "현금주의 회계처리 방법 납세자를 위한 세금 신고 방법.")도 참조하십시오.
**시리즈 H와 HH 채권.**
미국 재무부는 1980년부터 2004년 8월까지 HH 저축 채권을 매각했습니다. HH 저축 채권은 최대 20년 동안 이자를 받았습니다. 따라서 마지막 HH 채권은 2024년에 이자 적립이 중단될 것입니다. ( [TreasuryDirect.gov/savings-bonds/hh-bonds/(영어)](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/hh-bonds/)를 참조하십시오.)
특정 HH 채권은 현금화할 수 없었습니다. HH 채권을 매입하려면 이전에 구입한 다른 증권으로 거래해야 했습니다. 거래를 성사할때 기존유가 증권에 대해 적립된 이자를 HH 채권 매입시에 사용했을 수도 있습니다. 이전 채권을 사용하여 두 개 이상의 HH 채권을 매입한 경우, 채권 매입때 사용된 이자는 HH 채권에 비례하여 분배되었습니다. 그 당시에 해당 이자에 대한 세금을 납부할 것인지, 아니면 기다렸다가 나중에 납부 (이연) 할 것인지 선택할 수 있었습니다. 나중에 납부하기로 결정한 이자는 “deferred interest.”(이연이자) 입니다. 귀하의 HH 채권에 이연이자가 있을 경우 채권 앞면에 식별된 금액이 표시됩니다. 다음의 사실들이 발생한 연도에 대한 신고서를 제출하기 전까지는 연방 소득세 신고서에 이연이자를 신고하지 않아도 됩니다; HH 채권을 현금화했으며; HH 채권은 이자 적립이, 과세 대상인 소유권 변경을 나타내기 위해 HH 채권을 재발행한 경우.

시리즈 H 채권은 1980년 이전에 발행되엇습니다. 발행된 모든 시리즈 H 채권은 만기되었으며 더 이상의 이자소득이 발생하지 않습니다. 
일년에 두번 이자 지급에서 추가적으로, 대부분의 H 또는 HH 채권은 이연된 이자요소를 갖고 있습니다. 이에 대한 소득 신고 방법은 이 장의 나중에 설명될 것 입니다.
**시리즈 EE 및 시리즈 I 채권.**
이 유형의 채권에 따른 이자는 채권을 상환할 때 지급됩니다. 구입가와 상환가의 차액은 과세 대상 이자입니다.
_**시리즈 E 와 EE 채권.**_
시리즈 E 채권은 1980년 7월 이전에 발행되었습니다. 발행된 모든 시리즈 E 채권은 만기되었으므로 더 이상의 이자소득이 발생하지 않습니다. 시리즈 EE 채권은 1980년 1월에 최초로 발행되었으며 30년 만기이고 2012년 까지 지폐 (확정적) 양식으로 발행되었습니다. 지폐 시리즈 EE 와 시리즈 E 채권은 할인가에 발행되었으며 이자소득이 발생하면서 가치가 증가합니다. 전자 (장부기입식)시리즈 EE 채권은 2003년에 최로로 발행되었으며 액면가로 발행되었고 이자소득이 발생하면서 가치가 증가합니다. 모든 시리즈 E 와 시리즈 EE채권의 액면가와 누적 이자 총액은 상환 시 지급됩니다.
_**시리즈 I 채권.**_
시리즈 I 채권은 1998년 최초로 발행되었습니다. 이 채권은 물가지수 연계채권으로서, 액면가에 발행되며 30년 만기입니다. 시리즈 I 채권은 이자소득이 발생하면서 가치가 증가합니다. 액면가와 누적 이자 총액은 상환 시 지급됩니다. 
_**현금주의 회계처리 방법 납세자를 위한 세금 신고 방법.**_
귀하가 현금주의 회계처리 방법을 이용하는 경우, 시리즈 EE, 시리즈 I 채권에 따른 이자를 다음 방법 중 하나로 신고할 수 있습니다. 
  1. 방법 1. 해당 채권을 상환하거나 처분하는 연도 또는 채권이 만기되는 연도의 초까지 이자 신고를 연기. (단, 뒤에서 다룰 [_저축 채권 거래_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171489 "저축 채권 거래.")를 참조하십시오.) 
  2. 방법 2. 상환가 증가분을 매년 이자로 신고.


귀하가 소유한 모든 시리즈 EE 및 시리즈 I 채권에 동일한 방법을 적용해야 합니다. 상환가 증가분을 매년 이자로 신고하는 방법 2를 선택하지 않는 경우, 반드시 방법 1을 이용해야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_고등 교육 비용을 지불하는 연도에 채권을 상환할 계획이 있는 경우, 방법 1을 이용하면 이자를 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 해당 밥법에 관한 자세한 사항은 뒤에서 다룰_[교육 저축 채권 프로그램](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171497 "교육 저축 채권 프로그램") _을 참조하십시오._.
_**방법 1에서 변경.**_
이자 신고 방법을 방법 1에서 방법 2로 변경하고 싶은 경우, IRS의 승인 없이 진행할 수 있습니다. 변경하려는 연도를 기준으로 과거에 신고한 적 없는 모든 누적 채권 이자를 신고합니다. 
매년 이자를 신고하기로 결정하고 나면, 귀하가 보유하고 있거나 앞으로 보유할 모든 시리즈 EE, 시리즈 I 채권에 동일한 방법을 적용해야 합니다. 단, 다시 변경을 요청하려는 경우는 다음에서 설명합니다. 
_**방법 2에서 변경.**_
이자 신고 방법을 방법 2에서 방법 1로 변경하고 싶은 경우, 반드시 IRS의 승인을 요청해야 합니다. 모든 요건을 충족하는 진술서를 IRS에 보내면 자동으로 변경 승인이 발급됩니다. 
  1. 해당 증빙서류의 상단에 다음 번호를 타이핑 또는 프린트 해야 합니다. “131.”
  2. “131” 하단에 이름과 사회 보장 번호를 기입합니다.
  3. 변경 연도 (해당 연도 시작일 및 말일)를 기입합니다.
  4. 변경을 적용하려는 저축 채권을 기입합니다.
  5. 다음 사항에 대한 동의를 표합니다.
    1. 변경 연도 또는 이후에 매입하는 채권에서 발생한 이자 총액을 채권의 처분, 상환 또는 만기 중 더 빠른 일자를 기준으로 이자를 실현할 때 신고
    2. 변경 연도 이전에 매입한 채권에서 발생한 이자 총액을 채권의 처분, 상환 또는 만기 중 더 빠른 일자를 기준으로 이자를 실현할 때 신고하며, 이때 이전 과세 연도에 신고한 이자는 제외.


이 진술서를 변경 연도에 세금 신고서에 첨부하여 (연장 기간을 포함한) 기한 내에 제출해야 합니다.
수정된 세금 신고서와 함께 진술서를 제출하려는 경우, 변경 연도의 (연장 기한 포함) 신고 기한부터 자동으로 6개월이 연장됩니다. 이 진술서에 “Filed pursuant to section 301.9100-2i” (섹션 301.9100–2i에 따라 신고함) 라고 기입하십시오. 이처럼 기한을 연장하려면 변경 연도에 (연장 기한 포함) 기한 내에 최초 신고서를 제출한 기록이 있어야 합니다. 
이 진술서를 제출하는 대신, 양식 3115, ‘회계처리 방법 변경 신청’을 작성하여 방법 2에서 방법 1로 변경하기 위한 승인을 요청할 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 양식의 지침을 따라 자동 변경을 할 수 있습니다. 사용자 수수료는 부과되지 않습니다. 
**공동 소유자.**
귀하와 귀하의 자녀, 또는 귀하와 귀하의 배우자 등 미국 저축 채권을 공동 소유자의 명의로 발행받은 경우, 채권에 따른 이자는 일반적으로 채권을 매입한 당사자의 이름으로 과세 대상이 됩니다.
_**공동 소유자 중 한 명의 자금이 이용된 경우.**_
채권 매입 시 귀하의 자금을 이용한 경우, 귀하가 이자에 대한 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 다른 공동 소유자가 채권을 상환하고 수익금을 소유하도록 한 경우에도 동일한 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이 경우, 채권을 상환한 공동 소유자는 상환한 시기에 양식 1099-INT를 수령한 후 귀하에게 또 다른 양식 1099-INT를 제공하여 귀하가 세금을 납부해야 하는 채권의 이자 금액을 고지해야 합니다. 채권을 상환한 공동 소유자는 “지명인” 신분입니다. 지명인이 다른 사람에게 귀속되는 이자 소득을 신고하는 방법에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 550, 1장에서 _이자 소득 신고 방법_ 의 _지명인 배분_ 을 참조하십시오. 
_**공동 소유자의 자금이 모두 이용된 경우.**_
귀하와 다른 공동 소유자 모두가 채권 매입에 자금을 투입한 경우, 각자 투입한 자금에 비례하여 이자에 대한 세금이 부과됩니다. 
_**공동 재산.**_
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 재산 인정 주에 거주하며 채권을 공동 재산으로 보유하는 경우, 각 당사자가 이자의 절반을 얻은 것으로 간주됩니다. 별도 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 각각 채권 이자에 대한 세금을 절반씩 납부합니다. 공동 재산에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 555를 참조하십시오. 
_**표 6-1.**_
이 규칙은 [표 6-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171482 "표 6-1. 미국 저축 채권 이자에 대한 과세 대상자")에도 설명되어 있습니다.
**소유권 이전.**
귀하의 자금만으로 시리즈 EE, 또는 시리즈 I 채권을 매입하여 또 다른 공동 소유자 또는 수익자의 명의로만 재발행한 경우, 재발행 연도에 해당 채권으로 발생하고 과거에 신고한 적 없는 모든 이자를 귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 단, 채권을 귀하의 명의로만 재발행한 경우, 해당 기간에 누적 이자를 신고할 필요는 없습니다. 
(채권이 공동 재산이 아닌 이상) 채권이 배우자간에 이전되거나 이혼에 따라 이전되는 경우에도 동일한 규칙이 적용됩니다. 
_**공동 매입.**_
귀하와 또 다른 공동 소유자가 자금을 함께 투입하여, 시리즈 EE, 또는 시리즈 I 채권을 매입하고 이후 공동 소유자의 명의로만 해당 채권을 재발행하는 경우, 재발행 연도에 해당 채권으로 발생하고 과거에 신고한 적 없는 귀하의 지분에 해당하는 모든 이자를 귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 이 경우, 전 공동 소유자는 재발행 연도에 본인의 지분에 해당하며 채권 이전이 발생하기 전 과거에 신고한 적 없는 이자를 총소득에 포함시킬 필요가 없습니다. 재발행 이후 발생하는 모든 이자를 포함하여 해당 이자는 공동 소유자의 소득입니다. 
이 소득 신고 규칙은 새로운 공동 소유자가 귀하 몫의 채권을 매입하여 전 공동 소유자와 또 다른 신규 공동 소유자의 명의로 채권이 재발행되는 경우에도 동일하게 적용됩니다. 단, 신규 공동 소유자는 채권 이전 후 발생하는 본인 지분에 해당하는 이자만 신고하면 됩니다. 
귀하와 공동 소유자가 함께 매입한 채권을 각자 투입한 자금에 비례하는 비율로 귀하와 공동 소유자에게 별도로 재발행되는 경우, 두 당사자 모두 채권 재발행 전에 발생한 이자를 아직 신고할 필요가 없습니다.
### 표 6-1. 미국 저축 채권 이자에 대한 과세 대상자
**아래의 상황이라면** | **이자를 신고해야 하는 사람은...**  
---|---  
귀하의 자금만 투입하여 귀하와 공동 소유자의 공동 명의로 채권을 구입하는 경우 | 귀하입니다.  
귀하가 다른 사람의 명의로 채권을 구입하고 해당인을 채권의 유일한 소유자로 지정하는 경우 | 귀하가 채권을 구입해준 다른 사람입니다.  
귀하와 다른 사람이 함께 자금을 투입하여 공동 소유자로 채권을 구입하는 경우 | 귀하와 공동 소유자 모두 투입한 자금에 비례하여 세금이 배분됩니다.  
공동 재산 인정 주에 거주하는 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 재산으로 채권을 구입하는 경우 | 귀하와 귀하의 배우자. 별도 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자는 각각 이자에 대한 세금을 절반씩 납부합니다.  
**예시 1.**
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 각각 동일한 금액을 투입하여 $1,000의 시리즈 EE 저축 채권을 매입했습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 소유자가 되어 채권이 발행되었습니다. 두 당사자는 채권 이자의 신고를 연기합니다. 이후 두 당사자는 해당 채권을 각각 $500인 2개의 채권으로 나누어 1개는 귀하의 명의, 다른 1개는 귀하의 배우자의 명의로 재발행합니다. 이때, 귀하와 귀하의 배우자 모두 재발행 당시까지 발생한 이자에 대해 아직 신고하지 않아도 됩니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하는 본인의 자금으로만 $1,000의 시리즈 EE 저축 채권을 매입했습니다. 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 소유자가 되어 채권이 발행되었습니다. 두 당사자는 채권 이자의 신고를 연기합니다. 이후 두 당사자는 해당 채권을 각각 $500인 2개의 채권으로 나누어 1개는 귀하의 명의, 다른 1개는 귀하의 배우자의 명의로 재발행합니다. 귀하는 해당 채권의 재발행 시 이자의 절반을 신고해야 합니다. 
**신탁 이전.**
귀하가 보유한 시리즈 EE, 또는 시리즈 I 채권을 신탁으로 이전하고 소유권을 모두 포기하는 경우, 귀하는 이전일까지 발생하고 과거에 신고한 적 없는 모든 이자를 해당 연도의 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 그러나 귀하가 해당 신탁의 소유자로 간주되고 채권 이전 전후 모두 가치의 증가분에 대한 세금이 계속해서 귀하에게 과세되는 경우, 귀하는 각 연도에 발생하는 이자의 신고를 계속해서 연기할 수 있습니다. 해당 채권을 상환 또는 처분하는 연도나 만기가 되는 연도 중 빠른 일자 기준으로 이자 총액을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 
채권을 신탁으로 이전할 때 귀하가 시리즈 EE 또는 시리즈 E 채권 거래시 매입한 시리즈 HH 또는 채권이 포함되어 있는 경우에도 과거에 신고한 적 없는 시리즈 EE 또는 시리즈 E 채권의 이자에는 동일한 규칙이 적용됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_저축 채권 거래_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171489 "저축 채권 거래.")를 참조하십시오. 
**사망자.**
채권 소유자 (사망자)의 사망 후 시리즈 EE, 또는 시리즈 I 채권에서 발생한 이자 소득의 신고 방법은 사망자가 이용하던 회계처리 방법 및 소득 신고 방법에 따라 다릅니다. 이에 관해서는 간행물 550의 1장을 참조하십시오.
**저축 채권 거래.**
2004년 9월 이전엔 시리즈 E 채권 또는 EE 채권을 시리즈 H 또는 HH 채권으로 거래 (교환)할 수 있었습니다. 거래 당시, 시리즈 E 또는 EE에 누적된 이자에 대한 소득 신고를 거래를 통해 획득한 시리즈 H 또는 HH 채권이 상환 또는 만기되기 전까지 연기 (이연) 하도록 선택할 수 있었습니다. 이 거래를 통해 받은 현금은 시리즈 E 또는 EE에 누적된 이자까지만 소득이었습니다. 소득 신고 연기를 선택한 금액은 시리즈 H 또는 HH 채권의 맨앞장에 “Deferred Interest” (이연된 이자)로 기록되었으며, 이 금액은 귀하의 시리즈 H 또는 HH 채권 상환가와 원가의 차액과 또한 일치합니다. 귀하의 매입 원가는 시리즈 EE 또는 시리즈 E 채권 거래 시 가액과 당시 지불해야 했던 기타 비용을 합한 금액입니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 (이자 신고를 연기하고 있던) 시리즈 EE 채권을 $2,500에 시리즈 HH 채권으로 교환하고 $223로 상환했습니다. 귀하는 세금 신고서에 과세 대상의 소득으로 $223를 신고했습니다. 거래 당시, 시리즈 EE 채권에는 $523의 누적 이자가 있었고, 상환가는 $2,723이었습니다. 귀하는 시리즈 HH 채권을 만기까지 보유하고 $2,500을 받게 됩니다. 귀하는 만기 연도에 $300을 이자 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 이 금액은 채권의 상환가 $2,500과 귀하의 비용 $2,200 (시리즈 EE 채권 매입 시 지불 금액)의 차액입니다. 또한 시리즈 EE 채권의 누적 이자 $523과 거래 시 상환한 $223의 차액이기도 합니다. 
### 비고.
상환 또는 만기 시 신고 대상인 $300는 시리즈 HH 채권의 맨 앞장에 기록된 “Deferred Interest” (이연된 이자)에서 찾을 수 있습니다. 거래에서 하나 이상의 시리즈 HH 채권을 획득했을 경우 연기/이연된 이자의 총액은 시리즈 HH 채권들에게 비례적으로 나눠집니다.
_**거래 연도에 이자를 신고하는 선택.**_
귀하는 시리즈 EE 채권을 시리즈 HH 채권으로 교환할 때 과거에 신고하지 않은 모든 누적 이자를 해당 거래 연도의 소득으로 신고하는 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 이러한 선택했다면, 방법 1에서 변경으로 취급됩니다. 앞에서 나온 [_방법 1에서 변경_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171472 "방법 1에서 변경.")을 참조하십시오. 이자를 신고하기러 선택했다면, 거래로 획득한 시리즈 HH 채권의 맨 앞장에 기록된 “Deferred Interest” (이연된 이자)는 $0 또는 빈칸일 것입니다.
**미국 저축 채권 이자에 대한 양식 1099-INT.**
채권을 상환할 때 귀하가 지급받는 금액 중 이자가 $10 이상인 경우, 상환 담당 은행 또는 기타 지급인은 귀하에게 양식 1099-INT를 전달해야 합니다. 귀하가 지급받는 금액과 채권 매입 시 지불한 비용 간의 차액인 이자 금액이 양식 1099-INT, box 3에 표시되어야 합니다. 그러나, 귀하가 소득세 신고서에 포함해야 하는 금액보다 더 많은 금액이 양식 1099-INT에 표시될 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어 다음 조건 중 하나에 해당할 때 발생할 수 있습니다. 
  * 매년 채권의 상환가 증가분을 신고하기로 선택한 경우. 귀하가 이미 과거에 소득에 포함한 금액이 양식 1099-INT에 제대로 차감되어 반영되지 않을 것입니다.
  * 채권을 사망자에게서 받은 경우. 사망자가 사망 전 신고한 이자, 사망자의 최종 신고서에 기입된 이자, 또는 상속자의 소득세 신고서에 반영된 금액이 양식 1099-INT에 제대로 차감되어 반영되지 않을 것입니다.
  * 채권 소유권이 이전된 경우. 채권 소유권 이전이 발생하기 전 누적된 이자가 양식 1099-INT에 제대로 차감되어 반영되지 않을 것입니다.
**참조.** 이는 종이 채권에 해당되지만, 전자 채권의 재무부 신고 절차는 좀 더 개선되어 있습니다-재무부에게 전자 저축 채권의 이전이 신고 대상 이벤트라고 알려진다면 이전인은 이전된 연도에 이전 당시까지 누적된 이자에 대한 양식 1099–INT를 받을 것입니다. 이후에 이수인이 채권을 처분할때 (상환, 만기, 또는 다른 양도), 이수인은 본래 이전 당시 이전인에게 신고된 금액이 차감된 양식 1099–INT를 받을 것입니다.
  * 귀하가 공동 소유자이며, 다른 공동 소유자가 채권 매입에 자금을 투입한 경우. 귀하가 다른 공동 소유자를 대신해 지명인으로서 받은 금액이 양식 1099-INT에 제대로 차감되어 반영되지 않을 것입니다. (신고 요건에 관한 자세한 정보는 이 장에서 앞서 다룬 [_공동 소유자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171475 "공동 소유자.")를 참조하십시오)
  * 은퇴 연금 계획 또는 이익 분배 계획에 따른 과세 대상 분배금으로 채권을 받은 경우. 해당 계획의 과세 대상 분배금으로서의 이자 금액과 면세 이자 금액이 양식 1099-INT에 제대로 차감되어 반영되지 않을 것입니다. (이 금액은 일반적으로 분배 연도에 해당하는 양식 1099-R에 표시됩니다.)


세금 신고서에 정확한 이자 금액을 표시하는 방법에 관한 자세한 설명은 뒤에서 다룰 [_이자 소득 신고 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171550 "이자 소득 신고 방법")을 참조하십시오. 간행물 550에는 이러한 금액의 신고 방법이 예시와 함께 설명되어 있습니다.

#### 교육 저축 채권 프로그램
적격 고등 교육 비용을 지불하는 연도에 적격 미국 저축 채권을 상환하는 경우 해당 이자의 전부 또는 일부를 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 이 제외 규칙은 Education Savings Bond (교육 저축 채권) 프로그램으로 알려져 있습니다.
부부 개별 신고을 하는 경우에는 이 제외 혜택을 받을 수 없습니다.
_**양식 8815.**_
제외 금액을 산정하려면 양식 8815를 이용하십시오. 해당 양식을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 첨부하십시오.
_**적격 미국 저축 채권.**_
적격 미국 저축 채권은 1989년 이후 발행된 시리즈 EE 또는 시리즈 I 채권입니다. 유일한 소유주인 귀하의 명의로 발행된 채권이거나, 귀하 및 귀하의 배우자를 공동 소유자로 하여 발행된 채권이어야 합니다. 채권 발행일 이전 기준으로 귀하가 만 24세 이상이어야 합니다. 예를 들어, 부모 중 한 사람이 만 24세 미만인 자녀의 명의로 채권을 매입한 경우, 부모 또는 자녀의 소득에서 제외할 자격이 되지 않습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_채권에 부여된 발행일은 발행된 달의 첫 날이므로 채권 발행일이 매입일보다 앞설 수 있습니다._.
**수혜자.**
귀하는 (자녀를 비롯하여) 누구든 채권의 수혜자로 지명할 수 있습니다. 
_**IRS의 검증.**_
이 제외 혜택을 신청하면 IRS는 재무부의 채권 상환 정보를 이용하여 확인할 것입니다. 
_**적격 비용.**_
적격 고등 교육 비용이란 귀하, 귀하의 배우자, 또는 귀하의 부양가족 (귀하가 신청하는 비과세의 대상)이 적격 교육 기관에서 교육을 받기 위해 필요한 수업료 및 수수료를 의미합니다. 
적격 비용에는 적격 수업료 프로그램 또는 커버델 교육 저축계정 (Coverdell education savings account (ESA)에 납입하는 금액이 포함됩니다. 
기숙사 및 식비, 또는 스포츠, 경기, 취미 등 학위나 증서 취득에 필요하지 않은 과정에 대한 비용은 적격 비용에 포함되지 않습니다. 
_**적격 교육 기관.**_
미국 교육부가 운영하는 학생 지원 프로그램에 참여하도록 인가를 받고 자격을 갖춘 대부분의 공립, 사립 및 비영리 종합대학교, 대학, 전문대학 등이 적격 교육 기관에 포함됩니다. 
_**특정 혜택에 따른 차감.**_
다음의 모든 면세 혜택을 적격 고등 교육 비용에서 차감해야 합니다.
  1. 장학금 및 연구비 중 면세되는 부분 (8장의 [_장학금 및 연구비_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172139 "장학금 및 연구비.") 참조).
  2. 커버델 교육저축계정 (ESA) 인출금 중 면세 대상 산정을 위해 이용되는 비용.
  3. 적격 수업료 프로그램 인출금 중 면세 대상 산정을 위해 이용되는 비용. 
  4. 다음과 같이 교육 비용으로 받은 (선물이나 상속 재산을 제외한) 면세 수당:
    1. 재향군인 대상 교육 지원 혜택
    2. 적격 수업료 감면
    3. 고용주가 제공하는 교육 지원. 
  5. 미국 시민 기회 세액공제 및 평생 교육비 세액공제 산정을 위해 이용되는 비용.


_**제외 가능 금액.**_
해당 연도에 상환한 적격 미국 저축 채권의 총 수익금 (이자 및 원금)이 해당 연도의 조정 적격 고등 교육 비용을 초과하지 않는 경우, 이자 전액을 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 수익금이 해당 비용을 초과하는 경우, 이자 중 일부 금액만 제외할 수 있습니다. 
제외 가능한 금액을 산정하려면 수익금 중 이자에 해당하는 금액에 분수를 곱합니다. 이 분수의 분자는 해당 연도에 귀하가 지불한 적격 고등 교육 비용입니다. 분모는 해당 연도에 귀하가 받은 총 수익금입니다. 
**예시.**
2024년 1월, 부부인 마크와 조앤은 2008년 1월에 $5,000에 매입한 적격 시리즈 EE 미국 저축 채권을 $10,000에 상환했습니다. 원금 $5,000에 이자 $3,052을 합한 $8,052의 상환금을 받았습니다. 2024년에 이 부부는 딸의 대학 수업료로 $4,000를 지불했습니다. 이 금액에 대해 교육비 세액공제를 신청하지 않을 것이며, 딸은 본인 명의의 면세 교육 지원이 없습니다. 2024년에 이 부부는 $1,516.15 ($3,052 × ($4,000 ÷ $8,052))의 이자를 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 나머지 $1,535.85 ($3,052 − $1,516.15)의 이자는 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
#### 미국 재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권
재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권은 미국 정부의 직접부채 (채권)입니다.
**이자에 대한 과세.**
재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권에 의한 이자 소득은 연방 소득세 대상이며, 모든 주 및 지방 정부 소득세는 부과되지 않습니다. 해당 연도에 귀하에게 지급된 모든 관련 이자가 양식 1099-INT의 박스 3에 기입되어 귀하에게 전달될 것입니다. 
_**재무부 국채.**_
국채는 일반적으로 4주, 8주, 13주, 26주, 또는 52주 만기로 발행됩니다. 주로 $100 및 $100의 배수로 설정되는 할인가에 발행됩니다. 국채 구입 시 지불한 할인가와 만기 시 채권의 액면가 간의 차액은 이자 소득이 됩니다. 일반적으로 이 이자 소득은 채권 만기 시 지급이 이루어지면 소득으로 신고합니다. 국채에 할증금 (액면가를 초과하는)을 지불하는 경우, 만기 지급 시 해당 금액을 섹션 171 공제로 신고합니다. 
재무부 국채를 만기 때 신규 재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권으로 재투자를 한다면, 만기하는 채권 (원천징수된 세금을 제외한 액면금액) 의 수익금과 신규 재무부 채권의 차액을 지급 받을 것입니다. 그러나 귀하는 각 재무부 국채가 만기 시 이자의 총금액을 신고해야 합니다.
_**재무부 증권 및 채권.**_
재무부 증권에는 일반적으로 1년 이상 최대 10년까지의 만기 기간이 있습니다. 재무부 채권의 만기 기간은 일반적으로 10년 이상입니다. 두 경우 모두 $100부터 $100,000 사이의 가격으로 발행되며 일반적으로 매 6개월마다 이자를 지급합니다. 주로 이 이자가 지급되는 해에 소득으로 신고합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 550, 1장의 _U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds_ (미국 재무부 국채, 증권 및 채권)을 참조하십시오.

물가연동국채는 물가 상승 및 하락을 고려하여 조정한 원금을 기준으로 하여 고정금리로 연 2회 이자를 지급하는 국채입니다. 이 국채의 세금 처리에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 550에서 _Original Issue Discount (OID)_ (최초 발행 할인 (OID))에 있는 _Inflation-Indexed Debt Instruments_ (물가지표채무증권)을 참조하십시오.
#### 이자 지급일 사이에 매각된 채권
이자 지급일 사이에 채권을 매각하는 경우, 매각 가격의 일부는 매각일까지 누적된 이자를 의미합니다. 이 경우 해당 금액을 매각 연도의 이자 소득으로 신고해야 합니다.
이자 지급일 사이에 채권을 매입하는 경우, 매입 가격의 일부는 매입일 전까지 누적된 이자를 의미합니다. 귀하에게 이자가 지급되면, 이자 소득이 아니라 자본투자의 비과세 수익으로 취급하십시오. 해당 금액의 신고에 관한 자세한 설명은 간행물 550, 1장, _이자 소득 신고 방법_ 에서 _누적 채권 이자_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 보험
피보험자의 수익자로서 받은 생명보험 수익금은 일반적으로 비과세 대상입니다. 그러나 해당 수익금을 할부로 받는 경우, 각 할부 지불금의 일부를 이자 소득으로 신고해야 합니다.
할부로 수령하는 보험 수익금에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 525을 참조하십시오.
**연금.**
생명보험 수익금이 있는 연금에 가입하는 경우, 귀하가 받는 연금 지불금은 이자 소득이 아니라 무자격 계획의 은퇴 연금 및 연금 소득으로서 과세 대상입니다. 무자격 계획의 은퇴 연금 및 연금 소득에 관한 자세한 정보는 [5장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171199 "임금, 급여 및 기타 소득")을 참조하십시오. 
#### 주 또는 지방 정부 채권
정부 운영 자금으로 활용되는 채권의 이자는 주 정부, 컬럼비아 특별구, 미국 영토, 지방 정부, 또는 이들의 행정구역에서 발행한 채권인 경우 일반적으로 과세 대상이 아닙니다.
1982년 이후 원주민 부족 정부가 발행한 채권 (2009년 2월 17일 이후 발행된 부족 경제 개발 채권 포함)은 주 정부 발행 채권으로 취급합니다. 이러한 채권의 수익금 대부분이 정부의 필수 기능에 사용되는 경우 해당 채권의 이자는 일반적으로 면세 대상입니다. 그러나 정부의 필수 기능 요건은 2009년 2월 17일 이후에 발행된 부족 경제 개발 채권에는 적용되지 않습니다. 섹션 7871(f)를 보십시오.
연방 보장 채권, 융자 수익 채권, 차익거래 채권, 사적사업채권, 적격 채권, 세액공제 채권 그리고 이러한 채권의 이자에 대한 과세 여부를 비롯한 자세한 정보는 간행물 550, 1장, _주 또는 지방 정부 채권_ 을 참고하십시오.
**정보 신고 요구사항.**
세금 신고서 제출 시에는 귀하가 받은 모든 면세 이자 기입이 요구됩니다. 귀하에게 지급된 면세 이자는 양식 1099–INT, 박스 8에 신고될 것입니다. 이는 오직 정보 신고 요구사항입니다. 이로 인해 해당 면세 이자가 과세 대상 이자가 되지 않습니다. 
#### 최초 발행 할인 (OID)
OID는 이자의 한 형태입니다. 일반적으로 OID는 채무 증권 기간 동안 누적된 소득에 포함되며, 발행인으로부터 특정 지불금을 받았는지 여부와는 관계가 없습니다.
채무 증권이 만기 시 명시된 상환가보다 낮은 금액에 발행된 경우 일반적으로 OID를 포함합니다. OID는 만기 시 명시된 상환가와 발행가 간의 차액입니다.
만기 전 이자를 지급하지 않는 모든 채무 증권은 할인가에 발행된 것으로 추정됩니다. 이러한 유형의 채권 중 한 예로 무이자지급채권이 있습니다.
OID 발생주의 회계처리 규칙은 일반적으로 단기 채권 (발행일 기준 1년 이하의 고정 만기일 적용)에는 적용되지 않습니다. 간행물 550, 1장, _단기 채권 할인_ 을 참조하십시오.
**최소 허용 OID.**
할인액이 만기 시 명시된 상환가에 최초 발행일부터 만기일까지의 모든 연수를 곱한 수치의 1%의 1/4 (0.0025) 미만인 경우 0으로 간주할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 적은 할인액은 de minimis (최소 허용) OID라고 칭합니다. 
**예시 1.**
귀하는 OID $20이 적용된 10년 만기 채권을 $980에 구매하였고, 이 채권의 만기 시 명시된 상환가는 $1,000입니다. $1,000 (명시된 상환가)에 10 (최초 발행일부터 만기일까지의 모든 연수)을 곱한 수치의 1%의 1/4은 $25입니다. 할인액 $20가 $25 미만이므로 OID는 0으로 취급됩니다. (만기까지 해당 채권을 보유한 경우, $20 ($1,000 − $980)가 자본이득을 인지하실 것입니다.)
**예시 2.**
_예시 1_ 과 상황은 동일하며, 다만 채권은 $950에 발행되었습니다. OID는 $50입니다. 할인액 $50가 _예시 1_ 에서 산정한 $25 이상이므로, 이 OID를 채권 기간 동안 누적된 소득으로 포함해야 합니다.
_**최초 발행일 이후 매입한 채무 증권.**_
최소 허용 OID가 적용되는 채무 증권을 할증금을 주고 매입한 경우, 최소 허용 OID는 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 최소 허용 OID가 적용되는 채무 증권을 할인가에 매입한 경우, 할인액은 시장 할인 규칙에 따라 신고해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 550, 1장, _시장 할인 채권_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**현재 소득으로 OID를 신고하지 않아도 되는 예외 조건.**
이 장에서 설명하는 OID 규칙은 다음 채무 증권에 적용되지 않습니다. 
  1. 면세 채권. (단, 간행물 550, 1장, _분할 증권 및 이표채_ 의 _분할 면세 채권_ 을 참조하십시오) .
  2. 미국 저축 채권.
  3. 단기 채무 증권 (발행일 기준 1년 이하의 고정 만기일 적용).
  4. 다음 조건을 모두 충족하는 개인 간의 대출.
    1. 채권자가 대출 사업체가 아닌 경우.
    2. 해당 대출 금액에 동일 개인간의 과거 주요 대출 금액을 합한 금액이 $10,000 이하인 경우.
    3. 대출의 주요 목적이 연방세 회피가 아닌 경우. 
  5. 할증금을 지불하고 매입한 채무 증권.


**양식 1099-OID.**
소유한 채무 증서에 대해 양식 1099-OID를 받을 수 있습니다. 양식 1099-OID (Rev. 1-2024)를 받으면 박스 1은 “Original issue discount for the year”(해당 연도에 대한 발행시 할인); 박스 2는“기타 주기적 이자”; 그리고 박스 8은 “Original issue discount on U.S. Treasury obligations.”(미국 재무부 채무 증서에 대한 발생시 할인)이 표시될 것입니다.
대부분의 경우, 양식 1099-OID 박스 1, 2 및 8에 표시된 총액을 이자 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_양식 1099-OID에 표시된 OID 재산정_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171535 "양식 1099-OID에 표시된 OID 재산정.")을 참조하십시오. 
**양식 1099-OID 미수령.**
해당 연도에 OID가 발생했으나 양식 1099-OID를 수령하지 못한 경우, OID의 정확한 금액을 산정하여 세금 신고서에 기입해야 합니다. 정확한 OID 산정에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 1212를 참조하십시오. 
_**지명인.**_
귀하 소유의 OID 증권의 기록을 다른 사람 (등록된 보유자)이 보유하고 귀하를 대신해 양식 1099-OID를 수령하는 경우, 해당 보유자는 귀하에게 양식 1099-OID를 전달해야 합니다. 
**양식 1099-OID에 표시된 OID 재산정.**
다음 조건 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 양식 1099-OID 박스 1과 8에 표시된 OID를 재산정해야 합니다. 
  * 최초 발행 이후 할증금 또는 인수 할증금을 내고 채무 증권을 매입한 경우.
  * 채무 증권이 분할 채권 또는 분할 이표채 (특정 무이자지급채권 포함)인 경우.


2014년 이전 채무 증권을 매입한 경우 지급인은 오직 OID의 총 금액만 양식 1099–OID 박스 1 또는 8에 신고하도록 요구되고 있습니다.
소득 신고서에 보고해야 할 정확한 OID 금액 산정에 관한 정보를 보려면 간행물 1212 및 양식 1099–OID를 참조하십시오.
2013년 이후 채무 증권을 매입한 경우 지급인에게 채권 할증금액 의 상각을 원한다는 것을 알리지 않은 이상 지급인은 반드시 일반적으로 (1)채권 할증금 또는 채권 인수 할증금의 상각액이 제외된 OID의 순액 또는 (2)OID 총액 및 채권 할증금 또는 채권 인수 할증금의 현년도 상각총액을 신고해야 합니다.
**양식 1099-OID에 표시된 주기 이자 재산정.**
해당 연도에 채무 증권을 처분하거나 다른 보유자로부터 매입한 경우, 앞서 다룬 [_이자 지급일 사이에 매각된 채권_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171519 "이자 지급일 사이에 매각된 채권")에서 해당 채권에 대한 양식 1099-OID 박스 2에 표시될 주기 이자의 처리에 관한 정보를 확인하십시오. 
**예금증서 (CD).**
CD는 채무 수단입니다. 만기 1년 초과의 예금증서를 매입한 경우, 이자 총액 중 매년 해당하는 부분을 소득에 포함하여 다른 OID와 동일한 방식으로 신고해야 합니다. 
다음과 같은 은행, 주택대부조합 등의 유사한 예금 계정에도 동일한 규칙을 적용합니다. 
  * 정기 예금
  * 보너스 계획
  * 예금 증서
  * 이연 소득 증서
  * 보너스 예금 증서
  * 성장 예금 증서.


_**무기명 예금증서.**_
1982년 이후 발행된 예금증서는 일반적으로 기명식입니다. 무기명 예금증서는 기명되지 않은 형식의 예금증서를 말합니다. 등록된 예금자가 없고 한 개인이 다른 개인에게 이전할 수 있는 예금증서입니다. 
은행은 무기명 예금증서를 상환하는 사람과 IRS에 양식 1099-INT를 제공해야 합니다. 
**추가 정보.**
OID 및 시장 할인 채권 등의 관련 주제에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 550, 1장을 참조하십시오.
#### 이자 소득 신고 시기
이자 소득 신고 기간은 회계처리 방법이 현금주의인지 또는 발생주의인지에 따라 달라집니다.
**현금주의 회계처리 방법.**
대부분의 개인 납세자는 현금주의 회계처리 방법을 이용합니다. 이 방법을 사용할 경우, 이자 소득을 실제로 수령하거나 건설적 수령한 연도에 신고합니다. 단, 특정 채무 증권의 할인을 신고할 때는 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 앞서 다룬 [_미국 저축 채권_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171458 "미국 저축 채권") 및 [_최초 발행 할인 (OID)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171525 "최초 발행 할인 \(OID\)")를 참조하십시오. 
**예시.**
2022년 8월 31일, 귀하는 다른 개인에게 연복리 이자 4%로 $2,000를 빌려주었습니다. 귀하는 대출 사업체를 운영하지 않습니다. 원금 및 이자가 명시된 증권은 2024년 8월 30일 만기입니다. 2024년에 귀하는 $2163.20 ($2,000 원금 및 $163.20 이자)를 받았습니다. 현금주의 회계처리 방법을 이용하는 경우, 2024년 신고서에 $163.20의 이자를 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
_**건설적 수령.**_
소득이 귀하의 계좌에 입금되거나 귀하가 사용 가능하게 될 때 소득을 건설적으로 수령했다고 말합니다. 따라서 소득을 물리적으로 보유해야 하는 것은 아닙니다. 예를 들어, 은행이나 저축, 대출 및 기타 금융 기관에 있는 예금 또는 계좌에 이자, 배당금, 또는 기타 수익이 입금되거나 생명 보험 계약 증서에 따른 배당금의 이자가 축적되는 경우, 해당 금액이 귀하의 계좌에 입금되어 인출 가능한 상태가 되면 귀하가 수령한 것으로 간주합니다.
귀하가 다음 조건에 부합하더라도 예금 또는 계좌로 소득을 건설적으로 수령한 것으로 간주합니다. 
  * 짝수의 배수로 인출하는 경우
  * 인출하기 전 고지해야 하는 경우
  * 소득을 인출하기 위해 계좌에 있는 금액 전부 또는 일부를 인출하는 경우
  * 중도 인출 또는 상환 시 수령하는 이자가 만기 지급 이자보다 훨씬 적은 경우가 아닌 이상 중도 인출에 위약금이 적용되는 경우.


**발생주의 회계처리 방법.**
발생주의 회계처리 방법을 사용할 경우, 일반적으로 해당 이자 소득을 수령한 시점이 아닌 발생한 시점을 기준으로 신고합니다. 이자는 채무 증권 기간에 걸쳐 발생합니다. 
**예시.**
위의 예시에서 발생주의 회계처리 방법을 적용하면, 이자가 발생할 때 해당 금액을 소득에 포함해야 합니다. 다음과 같이 이자를 신고합니다. 2022년, $26.67; 2023년 $81.06; 2024년, $55.47.
**이표 채권.**
분리형 이표채가 포함된 무기명 채권의 이자는 일반적으로 이표채가 만기되어 상환되는 해에 과세 대상이 됩니다. 언제 지급을 위해 이표채를 보내느냐와는 관계가 없습니다. 
#### 이자 소득 신고 방법
일반적으로 모든 과세 대상 이자 소득은 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 2b에 기입하여 신고합니다.
_**스케줄 B (양식 1040).**_
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 제출 대상이며 다음 조건 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 스케줄 B (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR)의 파트 I도 작성해야 합니다. 
  1. 과세 대상 이자 소득이 $1,500를 초과하는 경우.
  2. (앞서 다룬) _[교육 저축 채권 프로그램](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171497 "교육 저축 채권 프로그램")_ 을 통해 이자 제외를 신청하는 경우.
  3. 매각자가 직접 자금을 조달하고 매입자가 해당 자산을 주택으로 사용하는 융자에서 이자를 받은 경우.
  4. 귀하가 이전 과세 연도에 신고한 금액이 기입된 미국 저축 채권 이자에 대한 양식 1099-INT를 수령한 경우.
  5. 귀하가 다른 사람에게 귀속되는 이자를 지명인으로서 수령한 경우.
  6. 동결된 예금 이자에 대해 양식 1099-INT를 수령한 경우.
  7. 귀하가 이자 지급일 사이에 매입한 채권에서 받은 이자에 대해 양식 1099-INT를 수령한 경우.
  8. 양식 1099-OID에 표시된 금액보다 적은 OID를 신고하려는 경우.
  9. 채권 이자소득에서 감가 상각 채권 할증금을 제외킵니다.


파트 I의 라인 1에 각 이자 지급인의 이름과 금액을 나열하십시오. 중개기관으로부터 양식 1099-INT 또는 양식 1099-OID를 수령한 경우, 중개인을 지급인으로 작성하십시오.

#### 소개
이 장에서는 사회보장 혜택 및 이에 상응하는 등가 계층 1 철도 은퇴 혜택에 대한 연방 소득세칙을 설명하고 있습니다. 이 장에서는 다음과 같은 주제를 다루고 있습니다.
  * 귀하가 받는 혜택이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 여부를 알아보는 방법.

  * 사회보장 혜택 워크시트 사용 방법 (예시 제공).
  * 귀하의 혜택 관련 공제 및 해당 연도에 수령한 혜택을 초과한 상환금에 대한 처리 방법.


사회보장 혜택은 월별 은퇴 연금, 유족 급여 및 장애인 연금을 포함합니다. 과세 대상이 아닌 보충적 보장 소득 (SSI)은 여기에 포함되지 않습니다.
등가 계층 1 철도 은퇴 혜택은 사회 보장 체계 하에 철도 직원 또는 수혜자가 받을 자격이 있는 계층 1 혜택 부분에 해당합니다. 이는 일반적으로 계층 1 혜택의 사회 보장에 상응하는 혜택 (SSEB) 부분으로 불립니다. 
2024년에 이러한 혜택을 수령하였을 경우, 양식 SSA-1099, ‘사회보장 혜택 내역서’ 또는 양식 RRB-1099, ‘철도 은퇴 계획 위원회에 의한 지급금’을 수령해야 합니다. 해당 양식에는 수령액과 상환금 및 해당 연도에 원천징수된 세액이 표시되어 있습니다. 같은 연도에 대하여 해당 양식을 여러 부 전달받을 수도 있습니다. 해당 연도에 대하여 전달 받은 양식 SSA-1099 및 양식 RRB-1099에 표시된 모든 금액을 더하고, 총수령액과 총상환금 및 해당 연도에 원천징수된 세액을 산정하십시오. 자세한 정보는 간행물 915의 마지막 장의 부록을 참조하십시오.

#### 혜택의 과세 대상 여부
귀하가 수령하는 혜택의 과세 대상 여부를 알아보려면 다음 총액과 귀하의 납세자 구분에 해당하는 [기본 금액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171900 "기본 금액.") (나중에 설명됨)을 비교해주십시오. 귀하가 수령하는 혜택의
  1. 절반액에
  2. 면세 이자를 포함한 귀하의 모든 기타 소득을 합한 금액.


**제외 사항.**
이와 같은 비교를 할 때 기타 소득에서 다음과 같은 부분을 제외하여 소득을 낮추지 마십시오. 
  * 적격 미국 저축 채권 이자,
  * 고용주 제공 입양 혜택,
  * 학자금 대출 이자,
  * 해외 근로 소득 또는 해외 주택, 또는
  * 아메리칸사모아 또는 푸에르토리코 실거주자에게 발생한 소득.


**자녀의 혜택.**
이 장의 규칙들은 자녀가 수령한 혜택에 관해서도 적용됩니다. 뒤에서 언급될 [_과세 대상자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171909 "과세 대상자.")를 참조하십시오.
**총 소득 산정.**
귀하가 수령하는 혜택의 절반액에 기타 소득을 합산한 총액을 산정하기 위해, 뒷부분에서 논의될 [워크시트 7–1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171901 "워크시트 7-1.")을 활용해주십시오. 합산 총액이 귀하의 기본 금액을 초과할 경우, 혜택의 일부가 과세 대상에 해당될 수 있습니다. 
기혼이며 2024년에 대하여 부부 공동 신고서를 제출할 경우, 귀하와 배우자의 혜택을 결합한 금액이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 여부를 판단하기 위해 귀하와 배우자의 소득 및 혜택을 합산하여야 합니다. 배우자가 수령한 혜택이 없더라도 귀하와 배우자의 소득을 합산하여 귀하가 수령한 혜택이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 여부를 알아봐야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2024년에 얻은 소득이 오직 사회 보장 또는 계층 1 철도 은퇴 혜택의 SSEB 부분에 해당할 경우, 귀하의 혜택은 일반적으로 과세 대상에 해당하지 않으며 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 될 가능성이 높습니다. 혜택에 더하여 소득이 있을 경우, 과세 대상에 해당하는 혜택을 수령하지 않더라도 세금 신고서를 제출해야 할 수 있습니다. 앞서 소개된 1장의_[세금 신고서 제출 여부](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170388 "세금 신고서를 제출해야 합니까?") _, 간행물 501 또는 귀하의 세금 신고서 지침을 참조하여 세금 신고서 제출 여부를 알아보십시오._.

**예시.**
만 65세 이상인 귀하는 2024년에 대해 미혼 세금 신고서를 제출하며 2024년에 사회보장 혜택을 수령하였습니다. 2025년 1월에 귀하는 박스 5에 순혜택 $1,500이 표시된 양식 SSA-1099를 수령하였습니다. 또한 귀하는 과세 대상 연금 $16,000과 이자 소득 $700를 수령하였습니다. 면세 이자 소득은 발생하지 않았습니다. 워크시트 7-1에서 산정된 바와 같이 귀하의 소득은 미혼 세금 신고를 하는 데 따른 기본 금액 ($25,000)을 초과하지 않기 때문에 2024년에 대해 과세 대상 혜택에 해당되지 않습니다.
귀하의 혜택은 과세 대상에 해당되지 않지만, 과세 대상 총소득 ($17,450)이 귀하의 납세자 구분에 따른 신고 대상 최저 금액을 초과하기 때문에 2024년에 대하여 세금 신고서를 제출해야 합니다.

**과세 대상자.**
혜택은 해당 혜택을 수령할 법적 권리가 있는 자의 과세 대상 소득 (과세 대상에 해당하는 경우에 한하여)에 포함됩니다. 예를 들어, 귀하와 귀하의 자녀가 혜택을 수령하는데 귀하의 명의로 자녀의 수표가 지급될 경우, 귀하에게 과세되는 혜택이 있는지 여부를 알아보기 위해서는 귀하의 혜택만을 고려해야 합니다. 자녀에게 해당하는 혜택의 절반액은 자녀의 기타 소득에 합산하여 자녀에게 과세되는 혜택이 있는지 알아보아야 합니다. 
**혜택 상환.**
2024년 중에 상환한 혜택은 2024년에 수령한 총 혜택에서 차감해야 합니다. 이는 해당 상환이 2024년 또는 그 이전에 수령한 혜택에 관해 이루어진 여부와는 무관합니다. 2024년에 수령한 총 혜택보다 많은 금액을 상환하였다면, 나중에 소개될 [_총 혜택보다 많은 상환금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171937 "총 혜택보다 많은 상환금")을 참조하십시오. 
귀하의 총 혜택은 양식 SSA-1099 또는 RRB-1099의 박스 3에 표시되어 있습니다. 귀하의 상환금은 박스 4에 표시되어 있습니다. 박스 5에 표시된 금액은 2024년에 대한 귀하의 순 혜택을 나타냅니다 (박스 3에서 박스 4를 뺀 금액). 박스 5에 표시된 금액을 이용하여 귀하의 혜택이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 알아보십시오. 
**세금 원천징수 및 추정세.**
귀하는 사회보장 혜택 및/또는 계층 1 철도 은퇴 혜택의 SSEB 부분에서 연방 소득세를 원천징수하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이를 선택할 경우, 양식 W-4V를 작성해야 합니다. 
소득세를 원천징수하지 않을 경우, 다른 소득으로부터 추가 원천징수를 하거나 해당 연도 중에 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 이전의 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세"), 간행물 505 또는 양식 1040-ES를 참조하십시오.
#### 혜택 신고 방법
귀하가 수령하는 혜택의 일부가 과세 대상에 해당할 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 사용하여야 합니다.
**양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 신고.**
귀하의 순 혜택 (귀하가 수령한 모든 양식 SSA-1099 및 양식 RRB-1099의 박스 5에 표시된 총액)을 라인 6a에 입력하고 과세 대상 부분을 라인 6b에 입력하십시오. 부부 개별 신고를 하며 2024년 내내 배우자와 따로 살았을 경우, 라인 6a에 표시된 “benefits” (혜택)이란 단어의 오른쪽에 “D”를 입력하십시오.
**과세 대상이 아닌 혜택.**
귀하의 순 혜택 (귀하가 수령한 모든 양식 SSA-1099 및 양식 RRB-1099의 박스 5에 표시된 총액)을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 5a에 입력하십시오. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 5b에 -0-을 입력하십시오. 부부 개별 신고를 하며 2024년 내내 배우자와 따로 살았을 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 5a에 표시된 “benefits” (혜택)이란 단어의 오른쪽에 “D”를 입력하십시오.
#### 과세 대상 금액
귀하의 혜택이 일부 과세 대상에 해당할 경우, 과세 대상 금액은 귀하의 혜택 및 그 외의 소득 총액에 따라 결정됩니다. 일반적으로 총액이 클수록 혜택의 과세 대상 부분도 커집니다.
**최대 과세 대상 금액.**
일반적으로 혜택의 50%까지 과세 대상에 해당됩니다. 단, 다음 중 하나의 조건에 해당할 경우 혜택의 85%까지 과세 대상에 해당될 수 있습니다. 
  * 혜택과 그 외의 모든 소득을 합산한 금액의 절반액이 $34,000 (부부 공동 신고를 할 경우 $44,000)가 넘을 경우.
  * 부부 개별 신고를 하며 2024년 중에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있을 경우.


**사용할 워크시트.**
귀하의 과세 혜택을 산정하기 위해 사용할 수 있는 워크시트에는 양식 1040의 지침에 있습니다. 또는 간행물 915의 워크시트 1을 사용할 수 있습니다. 단, 다음과 같은 경우에 해당되는 사항이 없어야 합니다.
  1. 전통적 개인 퇴직 계정 (IRA)에 기여하였으며, 귀하 또는 배우자가 직장에서 은퇴 연금 플랜에 의해 보장을 받는 경우. 이러한 경우, 간행물 590-A의 부록 B에 실린 특별 워크시트를 사용하여 IRA 공제 및 과세 혜택을 알아보아야 합니다.
  2. 상황 1에 해당하지 않으며 적격 미국 저축 채권 이자 (양식 8815), 입양 혜택 (양식 8839), 해외 근로 소득 또는 주택 (양식 2555), 또는 아메리칸사모아 (양식 4563) 또는 푸에르토리코 실거주자에게 발생한 소득에 대해 제외를 적용하는 경우. 이러한 경우, 간행물 915의 워크시트 1을 사용하여 과세 혜택을 산정해야 합니다. 
  3. 이전 연도들에 대해 일시불 금액을 수령한 경우. 이러한 경우에도 간행물 915의 워크시트 2 또는 3 및 워크시트 4를 작성하십시오. 이어질 [_일시불 선택_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171921 "일시불 선택.") 부분을 참조하십시오.


**일시불 선택.**
일시불 금액에 이전 연도들에 대한 혜택이 포함되더라도 과세 대상에 해당하는, 2023년에 수령한 혜택의 (소급한) 일시불 금액을 2023년 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 혜택에 대해 일시불 선택 방법을 사용하기로 선택했다면 양식 1040, 혹은 양식 1040–SR, 라인 6c에 있는 박스에 체크하십시오. 2024년의 여느 한 혜택이 과세 대상이며 지난 연도에 대한 일시불 혜택 지급금이 포함된 경우, 일시불 선택을 통해 과세 금액을 축소할 수도 있습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 간행물 915에서 일시불 선택을 보십시오._.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_이러한 혜택 일시불을 SSA 및 RRB가 많은 수혜자에게 지급하는 사망 혜택 일시불과 혼동하여서는 안됩니다. 사망 혜택 일시불은 과세 대상이 아닙니다._.
일반적으로 2024년에 수령한 총 혜택의 과세 대상 부분은 2024년 소득을 사용하여 산정합니다. 하지만 이전 연도들의 소득을 이용하여 이전 연도들에 대한 일시불 금액의 과세 대상 부분을 따로 산정하는 방법도 있습니다. 과세 혜택이 감소할 경우, 이러한 방식을 선택할 수도 있습니다. 
_**일시불 선택하기.**_
2024년에 이전 연도들에 대한 혜택이 포함된 혜택 일시불을 수령하였다면, _일시불 선택_ 아래에 소개된 간행물 915의 지침을 따라 일시불 선택이 과세 혜택을 줄여주는지 알아보십시오. 이 부분의 논의는 일시불 선택 방법에 관해서도 다루고 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이전 연도의 과세 혜택이 2023년 소득에 포함되었기 때문에 이전 연도의 환급액은 조정되지 않습니다. 이전 연도에 대하여 수정 신고서를 제출하지 마십시오._.

#### 혜택과 관련된 공제
귀하가 수령하는 혜택과 관련된 특정 금액을 공제받을 수도 있습니다.
**장애 연금.**
귀하는 이전 연도 세금 신고서에 소득으로 포함시킨 장애 연금을 고용주 또는 보험 회사로부터 수령했을 수 있습니다. SSA 또는 RRB로부터 일시불 금액을 수령하였는데, 고용주 또는 보험 회사에 장애 연금을 상환해야 할 경우, 이전 연도에 총소득으로 포함시킨 상환금에 대하여 항목별 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 상환금이 $3,000를 초과할 경우, 항목별 공제 대신 세금 공제를 받을 수도 있습니다. 이어질 내용인 _총 혜택보다 많은 상환금_ 의 [_이전 연도에 수령한 혜택 상환_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171937 "총 혜택보다 많은 상환금")에서 설명하는 동일한 방식에 따라 공제를 신청하면 됩니다.
#### 총 혜택보다 많은 상환금
때로는 양식 SSA-1099 또는 RRB-1099에 표시된 총상환금 (박스 4)이 수령한 총 혜택 (박스 3)보다 많을 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우, 박스 5에 표시된 순 혜택이 음수 값 (괄호 안의 값)일 것이며 과세 대상 혜택이 존재하지 않을 것입니다. 이러한 경우 워크시트를 사용하지 마십시오. 양식을 여러 부 수령한 경우, 첫 번째 양식의 박스 5에 표시된 음수 값을 동일 연도에 대하여 다른 양식의 박스 5에 표시된 양수 값으로 상쇄시킬 수 있습니다.
음수 값에 대해 문의 사항이 있을 경우, 지역 [SSA 사무소(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/agency/contact) 또는 지역 [RRB 현장 사무소(영어)](https://www.rrb.gov/Field-Office-Locator)에 연락을 취하십시오.
**공동 신고서.**
귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 공동 신고서 제출을 할 경우, 귀하의 양식 SSA-1099 또는 RRB-1099의 박스 5에는 음수 값이 표시되어 있고 배우자는 그렇지 않을 시에는, 배우자가 수령한 양식의 박스 5에 표시된 금액에서 귀하가 수령한 양식의 박스 5에 표시된 금액을 빼주십시오. 부부 합산 혜택이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 알아보기 위해 순 혜택을 구하는 과정입니다.
**예시.**
존과 메리는 2024년에 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 존이 수령한 양식 SSA-1099의 박스 5에는 $3,000가 표시되어 있습니다. 메리 또한 양식 SSA-1099를 수령하였으며 박스 5에 표시된 금액은 ($500) 입니다. 존과 메리는 $2,500 ($3,000에서 $500를 뺀 값)를 순 혜택으로 사용하여 부부 합산 혜택이 과세 대상에 해당하는지 여부를 알아볼 것입니다.
**이전 연도에 수령한 혜택 상환.**
귀하의 모든 양식 SSA-1099 및 RRB-1099의 박스 5에 표시된 총금액이 음수 값일 경우, 이전 연도 총소득에 포함시킨 혜택을 나타내는 이 음수 값의 일부를 공제받을 수 있습니다. 단, $3,000를 초과한 값에 한합니다. $3,000 이하일 경우, 기타 항목별 공제에 해당하여 더 이상 공제받을 수 없습니다.
_**$3,000를 초과하는 공제.**_
공제액이 $3,000를 초과할 경우, 두 가지 방식으로 세금을 산정하여야 합니다.
  1. 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 라인 16에 포함된 항목별 공제를 사용하여 2024년에 대한 세금을 산정하십시오. 
  2. 다음과 같은 방식으로 2024년에 대한 세금을 산정하십시오.
    1. 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 라인16에 포함된 항목별 공제를 배제하여 세금을 산정하십시오.
    2. 1983년 이후의 각 연도에 해당하는 혜택 상환을 나타내는 음수 값의 일부에 대하여 그 해의 총 혜택이 해당 음수 값의 일부만큼 감소한 것으로 간주하여 과세 혜택을 산정합니다. 그런 다음 그 해에 대하여 세금을 산정합니다.
    3. 귀하의 실제 총세액에서 새롭게 산정된 (b)의 총세액을 빼줍니다.
    4. (a)값에서 (c)의 값을 빼줍니다.


1 과 2 방식으로 산정된 세액을 비교합니다. 2024년에 대한 귀하의 세액은 두 값 중 더 적은 값에 해당합니다. 방식 1 에 의한 세액이 더 적게 산정되었다면 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 라인16에 표시된 항목별 공제를 취하십시오. 방식 2 에 의한 세액이 더 적게 산정되었다면 스케줄 3 (양식 1040)의 라인 13z 위의 단계 2c 에서의 금액을 공제액으로 청구하십시오. 박스에 “I.R.C. 1341” (국세법 1341)을 입력하십시오. 두 가지 방식에 의해 같은 세액이 산정되었다면 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 라인 16의 상환금을 공제 받으십시오.

#### 물물교환
물물교환은 재산이나 서비스를 교환하는 것입니다. 귀하는 물물교환으로 재산이나 서비스를 받은 시점의 공정 시장 가격을 소득에 반드시 포함시켜야 합니다. 다른 사람과 서비스를 교환하고 양 당사자가 해당 서비스의 가치를 사전에 합의했다면, 해당 가치를 다른 방식으로 표시할 수 있는 경우를 제외하고 해당 가치가 공정 시장 가격으로 받아 들여집니다.
일반적으로 해당 소득을 스케줄 C (양식 1040), 사업 이익 또는 손실에 신고합니다. 하지만 아래 [_예시 3_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171949 "예시 3.")에서와 같이 물물교환에 서비스 외 다른 내용이 포함된 경우, 다른 양식이나 스케줄을 사용해야 합니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하는 소규모 법인 클라이언트를 대상으로 법률 서비스를 수행하는 자영업 변호사입니다. 해당 법인이 귀하에게 서비스 지급금으로 증권 주식을 제공합니다. 귀하는 해당 주식을 받은 해에 스케줄 C (양식 1040)에 해당 주식의 공정 시장 가격을 반드시 기재해야 합니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하는 자영업자이며 물물교환 클럽 회원입니다. 해당 클럽에서는 교환 수단으로 “크레딧”을 사용합니다. 클럽에서는 회원에게 제공한 재화나 서비스의 대가로 귀하의 계정에 크레딧을 추가하며, 귀하는 물물교환 클럽의 다른 회원이 제공하는 재화나 서비스를 해당 크레딧을 사용하여 구매할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 다른 회원으로부터 재화나 서비스를 받은 경우 클럽은 귀하의 계정에서 크레딧을 차감합니다. 추후 과세 연도까지 다른 회원에게서 재화나 서비스를 실제로 받지 않을지라도 귀하는 계정에 추가된 크레딧 가치를 소득에 반드시 포함시켜야 합니다.
**예시 3.**
귀하는 작은 아파트 건물을 소유하고 있습니다. 아파트를 6개월 간 임대료 없이 사용하는 대가로 어떤 예술가가 귀하에게 창작한 예술품을 제공합니다. 귀하는 해당 예술품의 공정 시장 가격을 스케줄 E (양식 1040), 추가 소득 및 손실에 임대 소득으로 신고해야 하며, 해당 예술가는 스케줄 C (양식 1040)에 아파트의 공정 임대 가격을 소득으로 반드시 신고해야 합니다.
**물물교환에 따른 양식 1099-B.**

증여 또는 유증 외에 귀하의 부채가 취소 또는 탕감되었다면, 대부분의 경우, 취소된 금액을 귀하의 소득에 반드시 포함시켜야 합니다. 부채 취소가 증여의 목적으로 이루어진 것이라면 취소된 부채는 소득에 해당하지 않습니다. 부채는 귀하에게 법적 책임이 있거나 귀하가 보유한 재산에 적용되는 모든 채무를 포함합니다.
비사업 부채에 해당하는 경우, 취소된 금액을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8c에 기재하십시오. 사업 부채인 경우, 스케줄 C (양식 1040) (또는 농업 부채이며, 귀하가 농업 종사자인 경우, 스케줄 F (양식 1040), 농업 이익 또는 손실)에 해당 금액을 신고하십시오.

_**취소된 부채에 포함된 이자.**_
이자를 탕감 받았으며 박스 2의 취소 부채 금액에 포함되는 경우 해당 이자 금액은 박스 3에도 표시됩니다. 취소 부채 중 이자를 소득에 포함시켜야 하는지는 귀하가 채무를 상환했을 경우 이자가 공제 대상인지에 따라 달라집니다. 뒤에서 다룰 _예외_ 아래에 소개된 _[공제 가능한 부채](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171966 "공제 가능한 부채.")_ 를 참조하십시오.

**할인 된 담보 대출.**
금융 기관에서 담보 대출 조기 상환에 대해 할인을 제공하는 경우, 할인된 금액은 취소된 부채입니다. 취소된 금액을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.

귀하에게 개인적으로 담보 상환 의무가 있고 (소구 부채) 재산을 처분하면서 담보 경감을 받는 경우, 이득이나 손실은 재산의 공정 시장 가격까지 실현될 것입니다. 또한 담보 면제가 해당 재산의 공정 시장 가격을 초과한다면, 뒤에서 다룰 [_제외되는 부채_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171968 "제외되는 부채.") 자격을 갖추지 않은 경우 채무 면제에 따른 소득에 해당하게 됩니다. 비사업 부채로서 제외를 위한 자격을 갖추지 않은 채무 면제에 따른 소득은 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8c에 기타 소득으로 신고하십시오.
귀하에게 개인적으로 담보 상환 의무가 없고 (비소구 부채), 차압 등의 방식으로 재산을 처분하여 담보 면제를 받은 경우, 해당 구제는 귀하가 실현한 금액에 포함됩니다. 귀하가 실현한 금액이 재산의 조정 기준을 초과하는 경우 과세 대상 이득이 발생할 수 있습니다. 비사업 재산에 대한 이득은 자본이득으로 신고하십시오.

**취소된 부채의 상환.**
귀하가 취소된 금액을 소득에 포함한 후 나중에 부채를 상환한 경우, 해당 연도 소득에 포함된 취소 금액에 대한 환급을 청구할 수 있습니다. 해당 청구 제출의 소멸시효가 남아 있는 경우 양식 1040-X, ‘수정된 미국 소득세 신고서’에서 청구할 수 있습니다. 소멸 시효는 일반적으로 원래 신고서 제출 기한 이후 3년 간 종료되지 않습니다.

**스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065).**
파트너쉽은 일반적으로 세금을 납부하지 않지만, 양식 1065, ‘미국 파트너쉽 소득 신고서’에서 정보 신고서를 제출하고 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065)를 각 파트너에게 발송해야 합니다. 또한 파트너쉽은 각 파트너에게 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065)에 대한 파트너 지침 사본을 발송하여 각 파트너가 각자의 파트너쉽 소득, 공제, 세액 공제, 세금 특혜 항목 지분을 신고할 수 있도록 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: files.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/files.gif)_귀하의 기록을 위하여 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1065)를 보관하십시오. 특별한 요건이 없는 한 해당 문서를 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 첨부하지 마십시오._.
파트너쉽에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 541, ‘파트너쉽’을 참조하십시오.
**적격 조인트벤처.**
공동으로 소유하고 운영하는 사업에 귀하 및 배우자가 유일한 구성원으로 참여하고 해당 과세 연도에 공동 신고서 제출을 할 경우, 파트너쉽 대신 적격 조인트벤처로 간주되도록 상호 합의할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해서는 귀하와 배우자가 진행하는 사업에 따른 모든 소득, 이득, 손실, 공제 및 세액 공제 항목을 해당 파트너쉽에 대한 각자의 이권에 따라 나누어야 합니다. 상호 합의 방법과 제출할 스케줄 문서에 관한 자세한 정보는 귀하의 개인 세금 신고서 지침을 참조하십시오. 
#### S 법인 소득
대부분의 경우 S 법인은 소득에 대한 세금을 납부하지 않습니다. 대신 해당 법인의 소득, 손실, 공제 및 세액 공제는 각 주주의 지분비율에 따라 주주에게 귀속됩니다.
**스케줄 K-1 (양식 1120-S).**
S 법인은 양식 1120-S, ‘S 법인의 미국 소득세 신고서’에 대한 신고서를 제출하고 각 주주에게 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1120-S)을 발송해야 합니다. 또한 S 법인은 각 주주에게 스케줄 K-1 (양식 1120-S)에 대한 주주 안내서 사본을 발송하여 각 주주가 각자의 S 법인 소득, 손실, 세액 공제, 공제 지분을 신고할 수 있도록 합니다.

S 법인 및 주주에 관한 자세한 정보는 양식 1120-S 지침을 참조하십시오.
#### 회수
회수는 이전 연도에 공제 또는 세액 공제를 받았던 금액을 반환하는 것입니다. 가장 일반적인 회수 방법은 환급, 변제 및 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에 항목별로 기재된 공제의 환급, 변제 및 환불입니다. 또한 항목별로 기재되지 않은 공제 (이전에 공제된 대손상각 등) 및 이전에 청구한 세금 공제 회수가 발생할 수 있습니다.
**세금 혜택 규정.**
회수된 금액에 대한 공제 또는 세액 공제에 따라 줄어든 전년도 세금 금액을 회수 받은 해의 소득에 반드시 포함시켜야 합니다. 이러한 목적에서 해당 공제나 세액 공제에 따라 현재 연도로 이월된 금액의 증가는 전년도 세금을 감소시킨 것으로 간주됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 525를 참조하십시오. 
**연방 소득세 환급.**
연방 소득세는 소득에서 공제할 수 없으므로 소득세 환급은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다.
**주 정부 세금 환급.**
2024년 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급 (또는 크레딧 또는 상계)을 받은 경우, 전년도에 세금이 공제되었다면 일반적으로 해당 금액을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 지급인은 2025년 1월 31일까지 귀하에게 양식 1099-G를 발송해야 합니다. IRS도 양식 1099-G 사본을 수령할 것입니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출하는 경우 2024년 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 지침에 있는 주 및 지방 소득세 환급 워크시트를 사용하여 귀하의 소득에 포함될 금액을 계산하십시오. 간행물 525에서 다른 워크시트를 사용해야 하는 경우를 참조하십시오. 
어떤 과세 연도에 대하여
  * 주 및 지방 소득세 또는
  * 주 및 지방 일반 판매세


공제를 선택할 수 있었다면 소득에 포함해야 하는 최대 환급금은 해당 연도에 공제하기로 선택한 세금이 해당 연도에 공제를 선택하지 않은 세금을 초과한 금액으로 한정됩니다. 예시는 간행물 525를 참조하십시오. 
**담보 대출 이자 환급.**
귀하가 전년도에 납부한 담보 대출 이자를 2024년에 환급 받거나 크레딧을 받은 경우, 해당 금액은 양식 1098, 박스 4, 담보 대출 이자 내역서에 표시되어야 합니다. 2024년에 납부한 이자에서 환급 금액을 제하지 마십시오. 아래에서 설명한 규정에 따라 귀하의 소득에 해당 금액을 포함시켜야 합니다. 
**회수에 대한 이자.**
귀하가 회수한 금액에 대한 이자는 수령한 연도에 이자 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 예를 들어, 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급금에 대한 이자가 있다면 양식 1040, 1040-SR, 또는 1040–NR, 라인 2b에 신고하십시오. 
**같은 해 회수 및 비용.**
환급이나 기타 회수 및 비용이 같은 해에 발생한 경우, 해당 회수에 따라 공제 또는 세액 공제가 감소하며 소득으로 신고되지 않습니다. 
**2년 이상의 기간 동안의 회수.**
귀하가 2년 또는 그 이상의 기간 내에 납부한 금액을 환급 또는 다른 방식으로 회수할 경우, 귀하가 납부한 기간 사이에 회수한 금액을 비율에 따라 분배해야 합니다. 이전 연도에서 회수한 금액을 구하고, 해당 항목에 대해 현재 연도에 허용되는 공제 금액을 결정하기 위해 이러한 분배가 필요합니다. 분배를 계산하는 방법에 관한 정보는 간행물 525의 _회수_ 를 참조하십시오. 
#### 항목별 공제 회수
전년도에 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 공제한 금액을 회수한 경우, 일반적으로 회수한 금액 전체를 회수 받은 연도의 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
**신고 위치.**
귀하의 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 1에 기입하고 기타 회수한 금액 전체를 기타 소득으로 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 입력하십시오.
**표준 공제 한도.**
공제를 항목별로 입력하지 않은 경우 귀하는 일반적으로 표준 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 공제를 항목별로 입력하도록 요구되지 않은 한 표준 공제를 초과하는 항목별 공제만 회수 규정에 해당합니다. 전년도 신고서의 공제 총액이 해당 연도의 소득을 초과하지 않은 경우, 
  * 회수한 금액
  * 또는 표준 공제를 초과하는 항목별 공제 금액


중 더 적은 금액을 소득에 포함시키십시오.
**예시.**
귀하는 2023년에 공동 신고서 제출을 했습니다. 귀하의 과세 대상 소득은 $60,000였고, 그 어떤 세액공제에도 적격하지 않았습니다. 귀하의 표준 공제는 $27,700이였고, 항목별 공제 $29,200를 적용했습니다. 귀하는 2024년에, 2023년 신고서에서 공제된 금액을 다음과 같이 회수했습니다. 
의료 비용 | $200  
---|---  
주 및 지방 소득세 환급 | 400  
담보 대출이자 환급 | _325_  
총 회수액 | $925  
회수한 금액은 2023년 공제 금액을 초과하지 않았습니다. 공제한 주 및 지방 소득세와 지방 일반 판매세의 차액이 $400를 초과했습니다.
전체 회수는 귀하의 항목별 공제가 표준 공제를 초과한 금액 ($29,200 − $27,700 = $1,500)보다 적으므로 귀하는 전체 회수 금액을 2024년에 소득으로 포함시켜야 합니다. 주 및 지방 소득세 환급금 $400를 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 1에 신고하고 회수 차감잔액 $525를 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 입력하십시오.
**전년도 표준 공제.**
현재 연도에 회수한 금액을 소득에 포함할지를 결정하려면 공제를 청구한 연도의 납세자 구분에 대한 표준 공제를 파악해야 합니다. 귀하의 전년도 세금 신고서의 지침에서 전년도 납세자 구분에 대한 표준 공제를 찾아 보십시오. 양식 1040–NR을 제출했었다면 특정 인도 출신 비거주 외국인이 (간행물 519 참조) 아니라면 표준 공제를 청구할 수 없었습니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 2023년 양식 1040, 공동 신고서에 과세 대상 소득 $45,000을 신고했습니다. 귀하의 항목별 공제 금액은 $27,950이였습니다. 귀하가 청구할 수 있는 표준 공제 금액은 $27,700였습니다. 2024년 귀하는 2023 항목별 공제 중 $2,100를 회수했습니다. 회수한 금액은 2023년 실제 공제 금액을 초과하지 않았습니다. 회수 금액 중 $250을 2024년 소득에 포함시키십시오. 이는 귀하의 회수 금액 ($2,100)과 귀하의 항목별 공제에 표준 공제를 초과한 금액 ($27,950 − $27,700 = $250) 중 더 적은 금액입니다.
**회수 공제액으로 한정.**
전년도에 공제한 금액을 초과하는 회수 금액은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 소득에 포함할 금액은 다음과 같습니다. 
  * 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 공제한 금액 또는
  * 회수한 금액


중 더 적은 금액.
**예시.**
2023년에 귀하는 의료 비용으로 $1,700를 납부했습니다. 이 금액 중, 2023년 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 $200를 공제했습니다. 귀하는 2024년에 의료 보험 회사에서 2023년 비용 중 $500를 상환 받았습니다. 상환 금액 $500 중 2024년 소득에 포함되어야 하는 금액은 실제로 공제된 금액인 $200입니다.
**기타 회수.**
다음에 해당하는 경우 간행물 525의 _회수_ 를 참조하십시오. 
  * 항목별 공제 외 항목을 회수했거나
  * 전년도에 세액공제를 청구한 항목을 회수한 경우 (투자 세액공제 또는 행하 세금 세액공제 제외).


#### 개인 재산 임대료
귀하가 장비나 차량 등의 개인 재산을 임대한 경우, 소득과 비용 신고 방법은 대부분의 경우 다음에 따라 결정됩니다.
  * 임대 활동의 사업 여부 및
  * 이익을 위한 임대 활동 여부.


대부분의 경우 소득 또는 이익 창출을 주요 목적으로 지속적이고 정기적으로 임대 활동에 참여한다면 해당 임대 활동은 사업입니다. 
**사업 소득 및 비용 신고.**
개인 재산을 임대하는 사업을 운영하는 경우, 스케줄 C (양식 1040)에 소득과 비용을 신고하십시오. 양식 지침에 작성 방법이 소개되어 있습니다. 
**비사업 소득 신고.**
개인 재산을 임대하는 사업을 운영하지 않는 경우, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8l에 임대 소득을 신고하십시오. 
**비사업 비용 신고.**
개인 재산을 이익 추구를 위해 임대하는 경우, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 24b에 입력하는 전체 금액에 임대 비용을 포함시키고 해당 내용의 지침을 참조하십시오.
개인 재산을 이익 추구를 위해 임대한 것이 아닌 경우, 공제가 제한되며 다른 소득을 상계하기 위해 손실을 신고할 수 없습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 _기타 소득_ 아래에 소개된 [_비영리 활동_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172063 "비영리 목적 활동.")을 참조하십시오. 
#### 상환
전년도에 소득에 포함된 금액을 상환해야 하는 경우, 상환한 연도의 소득에서 상환한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 또는 상환한 금액이 $3,000를 초과하는 경우, 상환한 연도의 세액에 대한 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 상환이 사업 또는 비즈니스 혹은 영리 거래에서 발생한 비용이나 손실 자격을 갖춘 경우에만 공제나 세액 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다.
**공제 유형.**
상환 연도에 허용되는 공제 유형은 전년도에 포함된 소득 유형에 따라 달라집니다. 일반적으로 이전에 소득으로 신고한 것과 같은 양식 또는 스케줄에서 상환을 공제합니다. 예를 들어, 자영업 소득으로 신고한 경우, 스케줄 C (양식 1040) 혹은 스케줄 F (양식 1040)에서 사업 비용으로 공제합니다. 자본이득으로 신고한 경우, 스케줄 D (양식 1040) 지침에서 설명한 자본 손실로 공제합니다. 임금, 실업 수당, 또는 다른 비사업 소득으로 신고한 경우 상환 금액이 $3,000를 초과했다면 기타 항목별 공제를 적용할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_2018년부터 기타 항목별 공제를 청구할 수 없으므로, 상환 금액이 $3,000 이하일 경우 상환한 연도의 소득에서 공제할 수 없습니다._.
**사회보장 혜택 상환.**
귀하가 사회보장 혜택 또는 이에 상응하는 철도 직원의 은퇴 계획 혜택을 상환했다면, 7장의 _[혜택 상환](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171910 "혜택 상환.")_ 을 참조하십시오.
**$3,000 이하 상환.**
상환 금액이 $3,000 이하인 경우, 상환한 연도의 소득에서 공제합니다. 
**$3,000 초과 상환.**
상환 금액이 $3,000를 초과할 경우, 청구권에 따라 해당 금액을 소득에 포함했다면 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 16에서 기타 항목별 공제로 상환 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 즉, 해당 금액을 소득에 포함한 시기에 귀하가 제한되지 않은 권리를 보유한 것으로 간주했다는 의미입니다. 하지만 상환 연도에 대한 세액 공제를 선택할 수도 있습니다. 두 가지 방법 모두를 적용하여 세금을 계산하고 결과를 비교하십시오. 공제나 세액 공제 중 세금이 더 적게 발생하는 방법을 사용하십시오. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_상환 금액이 $3,000 초과 또는 미만인지를 판명할 때에는 신고서에서 전체 상환 금액을 고려하십시오. 각 상환 사례를 개별적으로 고려하지 않습니다._.
_**방법 1.**_
상환 금액에 공제를 청구하여 2024년 세금을 계산합니다. 귀하가 기타 항목별 공제로 상환 금액을 공제하는 경우 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 16에 입력합니다. 
_**방법 2.**_
상환 금액에 세액 공제를 청구하여 2024년 세금을 계산합니다. 다음 단계에 따르십시오. 
  1. 상환 금액에 공제를 청구하지 않고 2024년 세금을 계산합니다.
  2. 2024년에 상환한 금액을 소득에 포함시키지 않고 전년도의 세금을 다시 계산합니다.
  3. 전년도 신고서에 표시된 세금에서 (2)의 세금을 제합니다. 이 금액이 세액 공제입니다.
  4. 2024년 세금에서 공제 없이 (3)의 계산 결과를 제합니다 (1단계). 


방법 1의 세금이 더 적다면, 상환 금액을 공제합니다. 방법 2의 세금이 더 적다면, 스케줄 3 (양식 1040), 라인 13b에 존재하는 다른 세액 공제에 위의 (3)에서 계산한 금액을 더하여 세액 공제를 청구합니다. 해당 부분의 지침을 참조하십시오.
이러한 계산의 예시는 간행물 525에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
**사회 보장 및 메디케어 세금에 해당하는 임금 상환.**
전년도 임금 또는 보수 중 사회 보장, 메디케어 또는 계층 1 철도 퇴직 세법 (RRTA) 세금 납부 금액을 상환해야 했다면, 고용주에게 초과 금액을 환급할 것을 요청하십시오. 고용주가 세금 환급을 거절하면, 과다 징수 금액이 표시된 내역서를 요구하여 청구를 증빙하십시오. 양식 843, ‘환급 청구 및 세금 경감 신청’을 사용하여 환급 청구를 제출합니다.
**추가 메디케어 세금에 해당하는 임금 상환.**
직원이 전년도 소득세 신고서에서 추가 메디케어 세금에 대한 과세 금액을 구하여 전년도에 받은 임금 상환을 받은 경우 고용주는 추가 메디케어 세금 원천징수를 조정하거나 환급 청구를 제출할 수 없습니다. 전년도 임금이나 보상에 포함되고 추가 메디케어 세금을 납부한 금액을 상환해야 한 경우, 해당 금액에 대한 추가 메디케어 세금을 회수할 수 있습니다. 상환한 임금 또는 보수에서 추가 메디케어 세금을 회수하려면 임금이나 보상을 받은 전년도의 양식 1040-X를 제출해야 합니다. 양식 1040-X 지침을 참조하십시오.
#### 로열티
저작권, 특허, 석유, 가스, 광업권에 따른 로열티는 경상 소득으로서 과세 대상입니다. 
대부분의 경우 로열티는 스케줄 E (양식 1040)의 파트 I에 신고합니다. 하지만 운영 중인 석유, 가스, 광업권을 보유하고 자영업 작가, 발명가, 예술가 등으로서 사업을 진행하고 있는 경우, 귀하의 소득과 비용을 스케줄 C (양식 1040)에 신고하십시오.
**저작권 및 특허.**
문학, 음악 또는 예술 작품 및 유사한 재산에 관한 저작권에 따른 로열티와 발명품에 관한 특허에 따른 로열티는 특정 기간 동안 귀하의 작업물을 사용할 권리의 대가로 지급되는 금액입니다. 로열티는 일반적으로 판매된 책 부수, 공연 티켓 또는 기계의 수 등과 같이 판매 단위의 수를 기준으로 합니다.
**이름, 이미지, 초상 (Name, Image, Likeness-NIL).**
NIL은 학생 운동 선수가 재정적 보상을 받을 수 있는 수단을 설명하는 용어입니다. NIL은 마케팅 및 홍보 활동을 통해 학생 운동선수의 이름, 이미지 또는 초상을 상업적 목적으로 사용하는 것을 말합니다. 여기에는 싸인 서명, 제품 홍보, 라이센스 및 상품 계약, 광고 캠페인 참여, 소셜 미디어 게시물, 교육 캠프 또는 수업 등이 포함될 수 있습니다.
**석유, 가스, 및 광물.**
석유, 가스, 및 광물 자산에 따른 로열티 소득은 귀하의 재산에서 천연 자원을 추출할 때 받는 금액입니다. 이러한 로열티는 배럴, 톤 등의 단위를 기준으로 하며 귀하에게서 재산을 임대하는 개인이나 기업에서 지급합니다.
_**감모상각.**_
광물, 석유 및 가스 매장지에 경제적 이권이 있는 소유자라면 감모 공제를 통해 귀하의 투자금을 회수할 수 있습니다. 
_**석탄 및 철광석.**_
특정 상황에서 석탄 및 철광석을 처분하여 받은 금액을 로열티 소득이 아닌 자산 매각에 따른 지급금으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 석탄 및 철광석 매각에 따른 이득 또는 손실에 관한 정보는 간행물 544의 2장을 참조하십시오.
_**재산권 매도.**_
귀하가 석유나 가스, 광업권의 이권을 매도하는 경우 대가로 받은 금액은 로열티 소득이 아닌 섹션 1231에 따른 사업 또는 비즈니스에 사용되는 재산 매도를 위한 지급금으로 간주됩니다. 특정 상황에서 이러한 매도는 스케줄 D (양식 1040) 지침에서 설명한대로 자본이득 또는 손실 처리에 해당합니다. 섹션 1231 재산 매도에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 544의 3장을 참조하십시오.
재산 수명 동안 광업권 로열티, 최우선 로열티 또는 순이익을 보유한 경우 임대 또는 재임대 계약을 한 것이며 해당 재산의 다른 이권을 양도하기 위해 받은 현금은 감모 공제에 해당하는 경상 소득입니다.
_**매도된 향후 생산량 일부.**_
귀하가 광업권을 소유하였으나 향후 생산량 일부를 매도한 경우, 대부분의 경우 매도 시점에 매수자에게서 받은 금액을 해당 매수자가 제공한 대출로 처리합니다. 해당 금액을 소득에 포함시키거나 이를 기준으로 감모상각을 적용하지 마십시오. 
생산이 시작되면 모든 수익금을 소득에 포함시키고 생산 비용을 공제하며, 해당 광업권의 과세 소득에 적용되는 금액에서 감모상각을 공제합니다. 
#### 실업 혜택
귀하가 수령한 실업 수당의 세금 처리는 수당을 지급하는 프로그램 유형에 따라 달라집니다.
**실업 수당.**
귀하는 수령한 실업 수당 전체를 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 귀하에게 지급된 실업 수당 전액이 박스 1에 표시된 양식 1099-G를 수령해야 합니다. 대부분의 경우 스케줄 1 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR), 라인 7에 실업 수당을 입력합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_실업 수당을 수령하였으나 양식 1099–G를 우송받지 않았을 경우, 주정부 웹사이트를 통해서 본인 정보에 접속하여 전자 양식 1099–G를 받아야할 수도 있습니다._.
_**실업 수당 유형.**_
실업 수당에는 일반적으로 미국 연방 정부 또는 주 정부의 실업 수당법에 따라 받은 금액이 포함됩니다. 여기에는 다음 혜택이 포함됩니다. 
  * 연방 실업 신탁 기금에 따라 주 정부 또는 컬럼비아 특별 지구에서 지급한 혜택.
  * 주 정부 실업 보험 혜택.
  * 철도 실업 수당 혜택.
  * 실업 수당을 대체하기 위해 정부 프로그램에서 지급한 장애 연금. (근로자의 상해 보상 또는 질병 보상으로 수령한 금액은 실업 수당이 아닙니다. 자세한 정보는 [5장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000171199 "임금, 급여 및 기타 소득")을 참조하십시오.) 
  * Trade Act of 1974 (1974 미국 무역법)에 따른 무역 조정 수당.
  * Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (재해 구호 및 긴급 지원법)에 따른 실업 지원. 
  * Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 Program (1978 항공운송산업 규제 완화법 프로그램)에 따른 실업 지원.


_**정부 프로그램.**_
귀하가 정부의 실업 수당 프로그램에 기여하고 있고 귀하의 기여금을 공제할 수 없는 경우, 해당 프로그램에서 받은 금액은 귀하가 기여금을 회수할 때까지 실업 수당에 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 프로그램 기여금을 모두 공제한 경우, 귀하가 해당 프로그램에서 받은 전체 금액이 소득에 포함됩니다. 
_**실업 수당의 상환.**_
귀하가 2024년에 받은 실업 수당을 2024년에 상환하신 경우, 전체 수령 금액에서 상환한 금액을 제하고 차액을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040) 라인 7에 입력하십시오. 항목 옆에 있는 점선에 “Repaid” (상환됨)와 상환 금액을 입력하십시오. 전년도 소득에 포함된 실업 수당을 2024년에 상환하신 경우, 항목별 공제를 적용하고 해당 금액이 $3,000를 초과한다면 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 16에서 공제할 수 있습니다. 앞서 다룬 [_상환_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172015 "상환")을 참조하십시오.
_**세금 원천징수.**_
귀하는 실업 수당에서 연방 소득세가 원천징수되도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이를 선택하려면 양식 W-4V, ‘자발적 원천징수 요청’을 작성하고 이를 지급 사무소에 전달하십시오. 귀하의 지급금 중 10%가 세금으로 원천징수됩니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하의 실업 수당에서 세금을 원천징수하도록 선택하지 않은 경우, 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 원천징수나 추정세 또는 두 가지 방법을 조합하여 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않은 경우, 과태료가 부과될 수 있습니다. 추정세에 관한 자세한 정보는_[4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세") _을 참조하십시오._.
**추가 실업 수당.**
직원이 기여하지 않고 고용주가 조달한 기금에서 받은 혜택은 실업 수당이 아닙니다. 이는 임금으로서 과세 대상입니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 15-A, ‘고용주의 보충 세금 안내서’의 섹션 5에서 _추가 실업 수당 혜택_ 을 참조하십시오. 해당 지급금을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 1a에 신고하십시오. 
_**혜택 상환.**_
1974 미국 무역법에 따른 무역 조정 수당 자격을 갖추려면 추가 실업 수당을 일부 상환해야 할 수 있습니다. 추가 실업 수당을 수령한 해에 상환하는 경우, 상환한 금액만큼 전체 수당을 줄입니다. 다음 해에 수당을 상환하는 경우 수당을 받은 해의 소득에 전체 수당 금액을 포함시켜야 합니다.

.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_과세연도 2019년을 시작으로, 전통적 IRA에 기여 가능한 나이 제한이 폐지되었습니다. 더 많은 정보는 간행물 590-A를 참조하십시오._.
**보수란 무엇인가?**
일반적으로 보수는 업무 수행으로 얻는 것입니다. 보수에는 임금, 연봉, 팁, 전문 수수료, 보너스 및 개인 서비스를 제공하여 받는 기타 금액이 포함됩니다. IRS는 양식 W-2, 임금 및 세금 명세서의 박스 1 (임금, 팁, 기타 보수)에 적절하게 표시된 금액을 보수로 처리하며, 해당 금액이 박스 11 (자격을 갖추지 않은 은퇴 플랜)에 적절히 표시된 금액을 제한 것이라는 점을 전제로 합니다.
장학금 및 연구비 지급금은 양식 W-2의 박스 1에 표시되는 경우에만 이러한 목적에서 보수에 해당합니다. 그러나 2019년 이후에 시작되는 과세 연도를 시작으로 양식 W-2에 신고되지 않은 특정 비학비 연구비 및 생활비 보조금은 IRA 목적 상 과세대상 보수로 취급됩니다. 이 금액에는 귀하가 석사 학위 또는 박사후 연구를 지원하기 위해 지급된 과세 대상 비학비 연구비와 생활비 보조금이 포함되며 간행물 970, ‘교육에 대한 세금 혜택’의 1장에서 논의되는 규칙에 따라 귀하의 총소득에 포함됩니다.
보수에는 커미션과 과세 대상 위자료 및 별거 생활 유지비도 포함됩니다. 
_**자영업 소득.**_
귀하가 자영업자 (단독 소유주 또는 동업자)인 경우, 귀하의 사업 또는 비즈니스에서 발생한 순 수익 (귀하의 개인 서비스가 중요한 소득 발생 요인이라는 점을 전제로 함)에서 아래를 제한 금액이 보수입니다.
  * 귀하를 대신하여 은퇴 연금 플랜에 기여한 금액 공제와
  * 자영업세 중 공제 가능 부분.


귀하의 종교적 신념 때문에 자영업세에 해당하지 않는 자영업 소득도 보수에 포함됩니다.
_**비과세 전투 수당.**_
IRA 목적상 귀하가 미국 군대의 일원인 경우 귀하의 보수에는 비과세 전투 수당이 포함됩니다.
**보수가 아닌것은?**
다음 항목은 보수에 포함되지 않습니다. 
  * 임대 소득, 이자 소득, 배당금 수익 등 재산에서 발생한 수입 및 이익. 
  * 은퇴 연금 또는 연금 소득. 
  * 이연 보상 (이전 연도에서 이연된 보상 지불액). 
  * 귀하가 중요 소득 창출 요인인 서비스를 제공하지 않는 파트너쉽에서 받은 소득.
  * 스케줄 SE (양식 1040), 라인 1b에 신고한 자원 보전 프로그램 (CRP) 지불액.
  * 해외 근로 소득 및 주거 비용 등 전투 수당 외에 소득에서 제외한 금액. 


#### 전통적 IRA 개설 가능 시점 및 방법
전통적 IRA는 언제든지 개설할 수 있습니다. 하지만 어떤 연도이든 기여 시점은 제한되어 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_기여 가능 시점_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172613 "기여 가능 시점")을 참고하십시오.
다양한 기관에서 각기 다른 종류의 IRA를 개설할 수 있습니다. 은행이나 다른 금융 기관 또는 뮤추얼 펀드 기금이나 생명보험 회사에서 IRA를 개설할 수 있습니다. 증권매매업자를 통해서도 IRA를 개설할 수 있습니다. IRA는 국세법 요건에 부합해야 합니다.
**전통적 IRA 종류.**
귀하의 전통적 IRA는 개인 퇴직 계정 또는 연금이 될 수 있습니다. SEP 또는 고용주나 직원 협회 신탁 계정의 일부가 될 수 있습니다. 
#### 기여 가능 금액
전통적 IRA에 기여할 수 있는 금액에 영향을 주는 한도 및 기타 규정이 있습니다. 이러한 한도 및 기타 규정은 아래에서 설명하고 있습니다.
**공동 재산법.**
뒤에서 다룰 [_Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172612 "Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도.")에 관한 내용을 제외하고, 각 배우자는 본인의 보수를 이용하여 각자의 한도를 별개로 계산합니다. 공동 재산 법률이 적용되는 주에서도 이 규정이 적용됩니다. 
**중개인 커미션.**
귀하의 전통적 IRA와 관련하여 지급한 중개인 커미션은 기여 한도에 해당합니다. 
**수탁인 수수료.**
수탁인의 행정 수수료는 기여 한도에 해당하지 않습니다. 
**적격 예비군 상환.**
귀하가 예비군의 일원이거나 (혹은 과거에) 2001년 9월 11일 이후에 현역 복무를 명령 받았거나 소집된 경우, 귀하가 받은 적격 예비군 분배금에 상응하는 IRA 금액을 기여 (상환)할 수 있습니다. 이러한 기여로 인해 IRA 기여 총액이 일반적인 기여 한도를 초과할지라도 해당 금액을 기여할 수 있습니다. 이러한 상환 기여 자격을 얻으려면 IRA 또는 섹션 401(k)나 403(b) 플랜 또는 유사한 합의에 따라 적격 예비군 분배금을 받은 사실이 있어야 합니다. 
자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A 의1 장, _기여 가능 금액_ 아래에서 _적격 예비군 상환_ 을 참조하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하를 대신하여 전통적 IRA에 기여한 사실이 있는 경우 Roth IRA 기여 한도가 삭감됩니다. (뒤에서 다룰_[Roth IRA](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172815 "Roth IRA") _를 참조하십시오.)_.
**일반 한도.**
2024년에는 아래 금액 중 더 적은 금액이 전통적 IRA에 일반적으로 기여할 수 있는 최대 금액입니다. 
  * $7,000 (만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000). 
  * 귀하의 해당 연도 과세 대상 [보수](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172592 "보수란 무엇인가?") (앞부분에서 정의).


하나 이상의 전통적 IRA 기여 여부 또는 기여 금액의 전부 또는 일부의 공제 불가 여부와 관계 없이 최대로 기여할 수 있는 금액입니다. (뒤에서 다룰 [_공제불가 기여_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172677 "공제불가 기여")를 참고하십시오.) 적격 예비군 상환은 이 한도에 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
**예시 1.**
귀하는 만 34세 미혼이며 2024년에 $24,000을 벌었습니다. 귀하의 2024년 IRA 기여는 $7,000로 제한됩니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하는 파트타임으로 일하는 미혼 대학생이며 2024년에 $3,500를 벌었습니다. 귀하의 2024년 IRA 기여는 보수 금액인 $3,500로 제한됩니다.
**Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도.**
2024년에 공동 신고서를 제출하고 귀하의 과세 대상 보수가 배우자의 과세 대상 보수보다 적다면 해당 연도에 IRA에는 다음 중 더 적은 금액을 납입할 수 있습니다. 
  1. $7,000 (만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000). 
  2. 본인과 배우자의 해당 연도 총소득에 포함시킬 수 있는 보수 총액에서 다음 두 금액을 제한 액수.
    1. 해당 연도 중 배우자의 전통적 IRA 기여.
    2. 해당 연도에 배우자를 대신한 Roth IRA 기여.


해당 연도에 귀하 및 배우자의 IRA에 기여할 수 있는 합산 총액이 최대 $14,000 (부부 중 한 명이 만 50세 이상일 경우 $15,000, 부부 모두 만 50세 이상일 경우 $16,000)라는 의미입니다. 
#### 기여 가능 시점
전통적 IRA를 개설하는 즉시 선택한 스폰서 (수탁인 또는 기타 행정 담당자)를 통해 기여할 수 있습니다. 금전 (현금, 수표 또는 우편환) 형태로 기여해야 합니다. 재산은 기여할 수 없습니다.
**세금 신고 기한 내에 기여해야 합니다.**
전통적 IRA 기여는 해당 연도 중 어느 때든 또는 기한 연장 없이 해당 연도의 세금 신고 기한까지 완료할 수 있습니다. 
**기여 연도 지정.**
1월 1일과 4월 15일 사이에 전통적 IRA에 일정 금액을 기여한 경우, 해당 기여가 적용하는 연도 (현재 연도 또는 이전 연도)를 스폰서에게 알려야 합니다. 기여가 적용되는 연도를 알리지 않으면, 스폰서는 해당 기여가 현재 연도 (스폰서가 금액을 받은 연도)에 적용된다고 가정하여 IRS에 보고할 수 있습니다. 
**기여 전 제출.**
실제로 기여하기 전 전통적 IRA 기여를 청구하는 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 기한 연장 없이 세금 신고 기한까지 기여해야 합니다. 
**요구되지 않은 기여.**
그렇게 할 수 있더라도, 과세 연도마다 전통적 IRA에 기여할 필요는 없습니다. 
#### 공제 가능 금액
일반적으로 다음 중 더 적은 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다.
  * 해당 연도에 전통적 IRA에 기여한 금액 또는
  * 일반 한도 (혹은 적용되는 경우 the Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도).


하지만 귀하 또는 배우자가 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜을 적용 받는다면 해당 금액을 공제할 수 없습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있을 경우 한도_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172644 "고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있을 경우 한도")를 참조하십시오. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 전통적 IRA 기여에 세액 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590–A의 3장을 참조하십시오._.
**수탁인 수수료.**
귀하의 전통적 IRA와 관련하여 별도로 청구되어 지급된 수탁인의 행정 수수료는 IRA 기여로 공제할 수 없습니다. 또한 이러한 수수료를 항목별 공제로 공제할 수 없습니다.
**중개인 커미션.**
중개인 커미션은 IRA 기여의 일부이며 그러므로 한도까지 공제 가능합니다.
**전액 공제.**
귀하 및 배우자가 해당 연도에 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않은 경우 하나 이상의 전통적 IRA 기여 총액을 다음 중 더 적은 금액까지 공제할 수 있습니다. 
  * $7,000 (2024년 귀하의 나이가 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000) 또는 
  * 보수의 100%.


이러한 한도는 귀하를 대신한 섹션 501 (c) (18) 기여가 있을 경우 그 금액만큼 삭감됩니다. 
_**Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA.**_
공동 신고서를 제출하며 보수 금액이 다른 부부의 경우, 보수가 더 낮은 배우자의 전통적 IRA 기여 공제는 다음 중 더 적은 금액으로 제한됩니다. 
  1. $7,000 (2024년 배우자의 나이가 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000).
  2. 본인과 배우자의 해당 연도 총소득에 포함시킬 수 있는 보수 총액에서 다음 세 금액을 제한 액수.
    1. 보수가 더 높은 배우자의 해당 연도 IRA 공제.
    2. 보수가 더 높은 배우자 대신 해당 연도에 지정된 공제되지 않는 기여.
    3. 해당 연도에 보수가 더 높은 배우자를 대신한 Roth IRA 기여.


이러한 한도는 보수가 더 낮은 배우자 대신 501(c)(18) 플랜에 기여한 금액만큼 삭감됩니다. 
### 비고.
해당 연도 말 이전에 이혼 또는 법적 별거 상태이며 재혼하지 않은 경우 귀하의 배우자 IRA 기여금을 공제할 수 없습니다. 이혼이나 법적 별거 이후에는 본인 IRA 기여금만 공제할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 공제 액수는 미혼 납세자 규정에 따릅니다. 
**고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜 가입.**
귀하나 배우자가 기여한 연도 중 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜에 가입된 사실이 있는 경우, 공제 금액이 추가로 제한됩니다. 이 내용은 아래 [_고용주 플랜을 적용 받을 경우 한도_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172644 "고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있을 경우 한도")에서 다룹니다. 공제할 수 있는 금액에 대한 한도는 기여할 수 있는 금액에 영향을 주지 않습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_공제불가 기여_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172677 "공제불가 기여")를 참고하십시오.
#### 고용주 플랜에 가입 됨
고용주가 제공한 양식 W-2에는 해당 연도 적용 여부를 표시하는 박스이 있습니다. 해당 플랜에 가입되어 있는 경우 “Retirement plan” (은퇴 연금 플랜)박스에 표시하십시오.
예비군과 의용 소방대원은 뒤에서 다룰 [_적용을 받지 않는 상황_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172639 "가입되어 있지 않은 상황")도 참고해야 합니다.
고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜 적용을 받았는지 확신할 수 없는 경우 고용주에게 문의해야 합니다.
**연방 판사.**
IRA 공제의 목적에서 연방 판사는 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜에 가입되어 있습니다. 
#### 적용 연도
고용주 플랜을 적용 받는 과세 연도를 구하는 데에는 특별 규정이 적용됩니다. 이러한 규정은 플랜이 확정 기여형인지 확정 급여형인지에 따라 달라집니다.
**과세 연도.**
과세 연도는 기록을 보존하고 소득세 신고서에 소득과 비용을 신고하기 위해 사용하는 연차 회계기간입니다. 대부분의 납세자에게 과세 연도는 일반 연도입니다. 
**확정 기여형 플랜.**
일반적으로, 해당 과세 연도와 함께 또는 해당 연도 내에 종료되는 플랜 연도에 금액이 기여 또는 할당되는 경우 확정 기여형 플랜에 가입되어 있는 것입니다. 
확정 기여형 플랜은 제공자가 플랜의 적용을 받는 각 대상자에게 별도의 계좌를 제공하는 것입니다. 확정 기여형 플랜의 유형에는 이익 분배 플랜, 주식 보너스 플랜, 및 금전 구입 은퇴 연금 플랜이 포함됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A를 참조하십시오.
**확정 급여형 플랜.**
귀하가 과세 연도 내에 플랜 연도가 종료되는 고용주의 확정 급여형 플랜에 참여할 자격이 있는 경우 해당 플랜에 가입되어 있습니다. 이러한 규정은 귀하가 다음과 같은 경우라도 적용됩니다. 
  * 플랜 참여를 거부하거나,
  * 필요한 기여를 하지 않았거나,
  * 해당 연도의 급여를 적립하기 위해 필요한 최소한의 서비스를 수행하지 않은 경우.


확정 급여형 플랜은 확정 기여형 플랜이 아닌 모든 플랜을 의미합니다. 확정 급여형 플랜에서는 각 참여자에게 제공될 급여 수준이 해당 플랜에 명시되어 있습니다. 플랜 행정 담당자는 급여 제공에 필요한 금액을 계산하고 해당 금액이 플랜에 기여됩니다. 확정 급여형 플랜에는 은퇴 연금 플랜과 연금 플랜이 포함됩니다. 
**확정 권리 없음.**
플랜 연도에 급여를 적립하는 경우 해당 적립에 대한 법적 권리에 확정 권리가 없더라도 해당 플랜의 적용을 받습니다. 
#### 가입되어 있지 않은 상황
다른 고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않는 한, 아래에서 설명한 상황에 하나라도 해당한다면 고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않습니다.
**사회 보장 및 철도 은퇴 플랜.**
사회 보장 또는 철도 은퇴 플랜 보장 내용은 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜에 따른 보장이 아닙니다. 
**이전 고용주 플랜에서의 혜택**
이전 고용주 플랜에서부터 퇴직 급여를 받은 경우, 해당 플랜의 가입되어 있지 않습니다. 
**예비군.**
미국 군대의 예비군이라는 이유만으로 은퇴 플랜에 참여하는 경우, 해당 플랜의 가입되어 있지 않을 수 있습니다. 다음 조건에 모두 해당하는 경우 해당 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않습니다. 
  1. 귀하가 참여하는 플랜을 직원을 대상으로 다음 주체가 수립한 경우:
    1. 미국 정부,
    2. 주 정부 또는 주 정부 행정 구역, 또는
    3. 위에서 기술한 (a) 또는 (b)의 대행기구.
  2. 해당 연도 중 현역 복무 기간이 90일을 초과하지 않는 경우 (훈련을 위한 복무는 인정되지 않음).


**의용 소방대원.**
의용 소방대원이라는 이유만으로 은퇴 플랜에 참여하는 경우, 해당 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않을 수 있습니다. 다음 조건에 모두 해당하는 경우 해당 플랜의 가입되어 있지 않습니다. 
  1. 귀하가 참여하는 플랜을 직원을 대상으로 다음 주체가 수립한 경우:
    1. 미국 정부,
    2. 주 정부 또는 주 정부 행정 구역, 또는
    3. 위에서 기술한 (a) 또는 (b)의 대행기구.
  2. 해당 연도 초에 적립한 은퇴 급여는 은퇴 시 연 $1,800를 초과하여 지급되지 않을 것입니다.


#### 고용주 플랜에 가입되어 있을 경우 한도
귀하 또는 배우자가 고용주 은퇴 플랜에 가입되어 있는 경우, 귀하의 소득과 귀하의 납세자 구분에 따라 부분 (삭감된) 공제를 받거나 공제를 받지 못할 수 있습니다.
특정 금액 이상으로 소득이 증가하면 공제 금액이 감소 (단계적 삭감)되기 시작하며, 소득 금액이 더 높아지면 완전히 삭제됩니다. 금액 기준은 귀하의 납세자 구분에 따라 달라집니다.
공제가 단계적 삭감에 해당하는지 결정하려면 수정된 AGI와 귀하의 납세자 구분을 구해야 합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_납세자 구분_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172664 "납세자 구분.")과 [_수정된 조정총소득 (AGI)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172667 "수정된 AGI.")을 참조하십시오. 그 후 [표 9-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172654 "표 9-1. 직장을 통한 은퇴 플랜에 가입되어 경우 수정된 AGI1가 공제에 미치는 영향") 또는 [표 9-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172660 "표 9-2. 직장에서 은퇴 연금 플랜에 가입되어 있지 않은 경우 수정된 AGI1가 공제에 미치는 영향")을 사용하여 단계적 삭감 여부를 구하십시오.

  * 사회보장 혜택을 받은 경우.
  * 과세 대상 보수를 받은 경우.
  * 전통적 IRA에 기여한 경우.
  * 본인과 배우자가 고용주 은퇴 플랜에 가입되어 있는 경우.


워크시트를 사용하여 IRA 공제 금액과 공제불가 기여 및 사회보장 혜택 중 과세 대상 부분을 계산하십시오. 
**공제 단계적 삭감.**
귀하에게 고용주 은퇴 플랜에 가입되어 있고 사회 보장 은퇴 혜택을 받지 않은 경우, [표 9-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172654 "표 9-1. 직장을 통한 은퇴 플랜에 가입되어 경우 수정된 AGI1가 공제에 미치는 영향")에 표시된 바와 같이 귀하의 납세자 구분과 수정된 AGI에 따라 귀하의 IRA 공제 금액이 삭감되거나 제거될 수 있습니다.

2 해당 연도 중 배우자와 함께 살지 않은 경우, 이러한 목적에서는 귀하의 납세자 구분은 ‘미혼’으로 간주됩니다 (그러므로 귀하의 IRA 공제 금액은 “미혼” 열에서 계산됩니다).  
_**귀하의 배우자가 가입되있는 경우.**_

  * 양식 8815, ‘1989년 이후 발행된 시리즈 EE 및 I 미국 저축 채권 이자의 제외’에 표시된 적격 저축 채권 이자 제외.
  * 양식 8839, ‘적격 입양 비용’에 표시된 고용주 제공 입양 혜택 제외.


이 금액이 귀하의 수정된 AGI입니다. 
_**2024년 기여금 및 분배금.**_
다음 세 가지 내용에 모두 해당하는 경우, 2024년에 귀하가 받은 IRA 분배금은 부분적으로 면세 및 과세 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 
  * 하나 이상의 전통적 IRA에서 2024년에 분배금을 받은 경우.
  * 2024년에 전통적 IRA에 기여한 경우.
  * 이러한 기여 금액 중 일부는 공제불가 기여에 해당할 수 있습니다.


이러한 경우 전통적 IRA 분배금의 과세 대상 부분을 계산한 이후에 수정된 AGI를 구해야 합니다. 이를 위해 간행물 590-B의 워크시트 1-1를 사용할 수 있습니다.
위의 내용 중 하나라도 해당되지 않는다면 [워크시트 9-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172675 "워크시트 9-1. 수정된 AGI 산정")을 사용하여 수정된 AGI를 계산하십시오.
**삭감된 IRA 공제 계산 방법.**
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 적용되는 삭감된 IRA 공제 금액을 간행물 590-A 1장의 워크시트를 사용하여 계산할 수 있습니다. 또한 양식 1040의 지침에도 유사한 워크시트가 포함되므로 위의 워크시트 대신 사용할 수 있습니다.

#### 공제 가능 기여금 신고
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출할 때에는 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 20에 IRA 공제를 입력하십시오.
#### 공제불가 기여
IRA 기여 공제가 삭감 또는 제거될 수 있지만, [일반 한도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172607 "일반 한도.") 또는 해당되는 경우 [Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172612 "Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도.")까지는 IRA에 기여할 수 있습니다. 허용된 기여 금액 총액과 IRA 공제 금액의 차액이 공제할 수 없는 기여 금액입니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 만 30세이며, 미혼입니다. 2024년에 귀하는 직장 은퇴 연금 플랜의 적용을 받았습니다. 귀하의 보수는 $67,000였습니다. 수정된 AGI는 $90,000였습니다. 2024년 IRA 기여 금액은 $7,000였습니다. 은퇴 연금 플랜의 적용을 받았고, 수정된 AGI가 $90,000 이상이었으므로, 귀하는 IRA 기여 금액인 $7,000를 공제할 수 없습니다. 본인의 기여를 다음에 설명하는 내용과 같이 양식 8606에서 공제불가 기여로 지정해야 합니다.
**양식 8606.**
기여를 공제 불가로 지정하려면 양식 8606을 제출해야 합니다. 
세금 신고서를 제출할 때까지는 기여를 공제 불가로 지정하지 않아도 됩니다. 제출할 때에는 공제 가능한 기여도 공제되지 않는 것으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 
해당 연도에 세금 신고서를 제출할 의무가 없더라도 양식 8606을 제출하여 공제불가 기여를 신고해야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_적격 은퇴 연금 플랜을 전통적 IRA로 롤오버하고, 해당 롤오버에 비과세 금액이 포함된 경우 롤오버된 연도에 양식 8606을 사용하지 않습니다. 이러한 상황에서는 귀하가 IRA에서 분배금을 받은 연도에 양식 8606을 작성해야 합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 전액 또는 일부 과세 대상 분배금에서_[양식 8606](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172770 "양식 8606.") _을 참조하십시오._.
_**공제불가 기여금 미신고.**_
공제불가 기여금을 신고하지 않은 경우, 전통적 IRA에 기여한 모든 금액은 인출 시 공제 가능 기여금으로 처리될 것입니다. 귀하가 충분한 증거와 함께 공제불가 기여 금액이 있음을 표시하지 않는 한 모든 IRA 분배금은 과세 대상입니다. 
_**과대 신고에 대한 과징금.**_
어떤 과세 연도에 양식 8606에서 공제불가 기여 금액을 과대 신고한 경우, 합리적인 이유가 없다면 과대 신고마다 $100의 과징금이 부과됩니다. 
_**양식 8606 미제출 과징금.**_
정당한 사유를 제시하지 않는 한 필수 양식 8606을 제출하지 않은 경우 과징금 $50를 납부해야 합니다. 
**공제불가 기여 소득에 대한 과세.**
기여 한도 내에서 기여 금액을 납부하지 않은 한, 공제 가능 여부와 관계 없이 기여에 관한 소득 또는 이득에는 인출될 때까지 세금이 부과됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_IRA 자산 인출 또는 이용 가능 시점_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172739 "IRA 자산 인출 또는 이용 가능 시점")을 참고하십시오. 
**기초 원가.**
공제불가 기여 금액이 포함된 경우 전통적 IRA에 기초 원가가 있을 것입니다. 귀하의 기초 원가은 IRA에 납부한 공제불가 기여 합산 금액에서 해당 기여 불가 금액 중 지급 또는 인출된 금액을 제한 것입니다. 
#### 유산으로 받은 IRA
전통적 IRA를 유산으로 받았다면 귀하는 수혜자로 간주됩니다. 수혜자는 소유자가 사망 후 IRA 급여를 받도록 선택하는 개인 또는 법인입니다. 전통적 IRA 수혜자는 본인이 받는 과세 대상 분배금을 모두 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다.
**배우자에게서 유산으로 받은 IRA.**
전통적 IRA를 배우자에게서 유산으로 받았다면 일반적으로 다음 세 가지 중 하나를 선택할 수 있습니다.
  1. 본인을 해당 IRA 계좌 소유자로 지정하여 본인 것으로 처리.
  2. 해당 IRA를 본인의 IRA로 롤오버하거나 과세 가능한 한도에서 다음으로 롤오버하여 본인 소유로 처리해야 합니다. 
    1. 적격 고용주 플랜,
    2. 적격 직원 연금 플랜 (섹션 403(a) 플랜),
    3. 면세 연금 플랜 (섹션 403(b) 플랜), 또는
    4. 주 또는 지방 정부의 이연 보상 플랜 (섹션 457 플랜)
  3. 해당 IRA를 본인 소유로 처리하지 않고 본인을 수혜자로 처리.


_**본인 소유로 취급.**_
다음과 같은 상황에서 귀하는 해당 IRA를 본인 소유로 취급하기로 선택했다고 간주됩니다. 
  * 롤오버 기여 등 유산으로 받은 IRA에 기여금을 납부한 경우 또는
  * 해당 연도에 해당 IRA 수혜자로서 필수 최소 분배금을 신청하지 않은 경우.


다음과 같은 상황에서만 귀하는 해당 IRA를 본인 소유로 처리하기로 선택했다고 간주됩니다.
  * 해당 IRA의 단독 수혜자이며
  * 해당 IRA에서 제한 없이 금액을 인출할 수 있는 권리를 보유한 경우.


하지만 사망한 배우자의 IRA에서 분배금을 받는 경우, 해당 배우자 IRA의 단독 수혜자가 아니더라도 해당 분배금이 필수 분배금이 아니라면 60일 시한 이내에 해당 분배금을 귀하의 IRA로 롤오버할 수 있습니다.
**배우자 외의 사람에게서 유산으로 받은 IRA.**
전통적 IRA를 사망한 배우자 외의 다른 사람에게서 유산으로 받는 경우, 유산으로 받은 IRA를 귀하의 소유로 처리할 수 없습니다. 즉, 귀하가 해당 IRA에 어떠한 기여 금액도 납부할 수 없다는 의미입니다. 또한 유산으로 받은 IRA에서 어떤 금액도 롤오버할 수 없다는 의미이기도 합니다. 하지만 수혜자인 귀하의 급여를 위해 사망한 IRA 소유자의 이름으로 해당 IRA에서 롤오버되는 금액을 설정 및 유지하고 있다면 수탁인 사이의 양도가 가능합니다.
자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_다른 IRA로 롤오버_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172708 "다른 IRA로 롤오버") 및 [유산으로 받은 IRA](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172715 "유산으로 받은 IRA.") 를 참조하십시오.
#### 은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부
귀하는 전통적 IRA 등 다른 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 전통적 IRA로 세금 없이 자산 (현금 또는 재산)을 양도할 수 있습니다. 다음과 같은 양도 종류를 진행할 수 있습니다.
  * 수탁인 사이의 양도.
  * 롤오버.
  * 이혼에 따른 양도.


**Roth IRA로 이체.**
특정 조건에서 귀하는 자산을 전통적 IRA 또는 지정된 Roth 계좌에서 Roth IRA로 옮길 수 있습니다. 또한 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 Roth IRA로도 자산을 옮길 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 _Roth IRA_ 의 [_Roth IRA로의 금액 이동 가능 여부_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172846 "Roth IRA로의 금액 이동 가능 여부")를 참조하십시오. 
#### 수탁인 간 양도
귀하 또는 수탁인의 요청으로 어떤 수탁인의 전통적 IRA에 있는 자금을 다른 수탁인의 전통적 IRA로 양도하는 사례는 롤오버가 아닙니다. 여기에는 현재 수탁인이 새로운 수탁인에게 수표를 발행하지만, 예금을 위해 귀하에게 해당 수표를 전달하는 상황이 포함됩니다. 귀하에게 제공되는 분배금이 없으므로 해당 양도 사례는 면세입니다. 롤오버가 아니므로 아래 [_IRA 간 롤오버_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172708 "다른 IRA로 롤오버")에서 소개하는 롤오버 사이에 필요한 1년의 대기 기간의 영향을 받지 않습니다. IRA가 아닌 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 IRA로의 직접 양도에 관한 정보는 1장, _은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부_ 와 간행물 590-A의 2장, _Roth IRA로의 금액 이동 가능 여부_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 롤오버
일반적으로 귀하가 기여한 은퇴 연금 플랜의 현금 또는 기타 자산을 귀하께 면세로 인출하여 다른 은퇴 연금 플랜으로 롤오버하는 것입니다. 두 번째 은퇴 연금 플랜 기여를 롤오버 기여라고 합니다.
### 참고.
은퇴 연금 플랜에서 다른 은퇴 연금 플랜으로 면세로 롤오버한 금액은 일반적으로 두 번째 연금 플랜에서 인출되었을 때 소득에 포함될 수 있습니다.
**전통적 IRA로의 롤오버 종류.**
다음 플랜에서 전통적 IRA로 금액을 롤오버할 수 있습니다.
  * 전통적 IRA.
  * 고용주가 직원에게 제공하는 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜.
  * 주 또는 지방 정부의 이연 보상 플랜 (섹션 457 플랜).
  * 세금 감면 연금 플랜 (섹션 403(b) 플랜).


**롤오버 처리.**
롤오버 기여는 공제할 수 없지만 문서 뒷부분의 [_IRA 롤오버 신고_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172718 "IRA 롤오버 신고.") 및 [_고용주 플랜 롤오버 신고_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172726 "고용주 플랜에서 롤오버 신고.")에서 설명하는 바와 같이 세금 신고서에 롤오버 기여를 신고해야 합니다. 
_**롤오버 통지서.**_
인출하는 IRA 외 은퇴 플랜에서 롤오버 처리에 대한 서면 설명을 귀하에게 전달해야 합니다. 간행물 590-A에서 _수혜자에 대한 서면 설명_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**전통적 IRA 롤오버 종류.**
전통적 IRA 분배금을 적격 플랜으로 세금 없이 롤오버할 수 있습니다. 이러한 플랜에는 연방 절약형 저축 플랜 (연방 공무원 대상), 주 또는 지방 정부의 이연 보상 플랜 (섹션 457 플랜), 및 세금 감면 연금 플랜 (섹션 403(b) 플랜)이 포함됩니다. 롤오버할 수 있는 분배금의 일부는 다른 방법으로 과세할 수 있는 부분입니다 (소득에 포함 가능). 적격 플랜은 이러한 롤오버를 수용할 수 있지만, 의무는 아닙니다.
**롤오버 기여 시한.**
귀하는 반드시 일반적으로 전통적 IRA 또는 고용주 플랜에서 분배금을 받은 날로부터 60일째 되는 날까지 롤오버 기여를 납부해야 합니다.
IRS는 피해, 재난 또는 합리적으로 통제할 수 없는 다른 사건이 발생하는 등 60일 시한 요건을 면제하지 않는 것이 형평과 양심에 반할 수 있는 경우에는 해당 요건을 면제할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A의 1장, _은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부_ 를 참조하십시오.
_**롤오버 기한 연장.**_
전통적 IRA 또는 적격 고용주 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 인출된 금액이 롤오버 허용 기간인 60일 중 어느 시점에 동결된 예금인 경우, 특별 규정에 의해 롤오버 기한이 연장됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A의 1장, _은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부_ 를 참조하십시오. 
#### 다른 IRA로 롤오버
60일 이내에 동일한 IRA 또는 다른 전통적 IRA에 롤오버하는 경우 전통적 IRA의 자산 전체 또는 일부를 세금 없이 인출할 수 있습니다. 롤오버에 해당하므로 IRA에 롤오버한 금액은 공제할 수 없습니다.
**롤오버 간 대기 기간.**
일반적으로 전통적 IRA의 분배금 일부를 세금 없이 롤오버하는 경우, 1년 이내에는 동일한 IRA의 최근 분배금을 세금 없이 롤오버할 수 없습니다. 또한 세금 없이 롤오버한 IRA에서 1년 이내에 인출한 금액은 세금 없이 롤오버할 수 없습니다.
1년 기간은 귀하가 IRA 분배금을 IRA에 롤오버한 날짜가 아닌 해당 분배금을 받은 날짜부터 시작합니다. 전통적 IRA에 수행할 수 있는 롤오버 횟수에 적용되는 규정. 다음에서 소개하는 [_롤오버 1회 제한 적용_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032281 "롤오버 1회 제한 적용.")을 참고하십시오.
**롤오버 1회 제한 적용.**
보유하고 있는 IRA 수와 관계 없이 1년 내에 IRA에서 동일하거나 다른 IRA로 한 번만 롤오버할 수 있습니다. SEP 및 SIMPLE IRA 및 전통적 IRA와 Roth IRA 등 개인의 IRA를 총합하여 한도의 목적에서 사실상 하나의 IRA로 처리함으로써 이러한 한도를 적용합니다. 하지만 IRA 간 수탁인 간 양도는 제한되지 않으며, 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로의 롤오버 (변환)도 제한되지 않습니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 다음 세 개의 IRA를 보유하고 있습니다. IRA-1, IRA-2, IRA-3. 귀하는 2024년에 이러한 IRA에서 금액을 인출하지 않았습니다. 2025년 1월 1일, 귀하는 IRA-1에서 금액을 인출하여 같은 날 IRA-2에 롤오버했습니다. 이에 따라서 존은 2025년 동안 IRA-3과 관련된 롤오버 분배금 등 다른 2024년 IRA 분배금을 롤오버할 수 없습니다. 이는 수탁인 간 양도 또는 Roth IRA 변환에는 적용되지 않습니다.
**부분적 롤오버.**
귀하가 전통적 IRA에서 자산을 인출하는 경우, 분배금의 일부를 세금 없이 롤오버하고 나머지를 보관할 수 있습니다. 보관하는 금액은 일반적으로 과세 대상입니다 (공제불가 기여를 반환하는 금액일 경우 제외). 보관 금액은 뒤에 [_과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172777 "과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위")에서 소개하는 조기 분배금에 대한 10% 추가 세금에 해당할 수 있습니다.
**필수 분배금.**
뒤에서 다룰 [필수 최저 분배금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172748 "IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 \(필수 최저 분배금\)") 규정에 따라 특정 연도에 반드시 인출해야 하는 금액은 롤오버 처리 자격에 해당하지 않습니다. 
**유산으로 받은 IRA.**
배우자에게서 전통적 IRA를 유산으로 받는 경우, 일반적으로 롤오버하거나 유산으로 받은 IRA를 본인이 소유하기로 선택할 수 있습니다. 앞에서 다룬 [_본인 소유로 처리_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172690 "본인 소유로 취급.")를 참조하십시오.
_**배우자 외의 사람에게서 유산으로 받은 IRA.**_
배우자 외의 사람에게서 전통적 IRA를 유산으로 받은 경우, 롤오버하거나 롤오버 기여를 받도록 허용할 수 없습니다. 특정 기간 내에 해당 IRA 자산을 반드시 인출해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B의 1장, _자산 인출 시기 (필수 최저 분배금)_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**IRA 롤오버 신고.**
전통적 IRA에서 동일하거나 다른 전통적 IRA로의 롤오버는 다음과 같이 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 신고하십시오.
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 4a에 분배금 전체 금액을 입력하십시오. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4a의 전체 금액을 롤오버한 경우 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4b에 0을 입력하십시오. 전체 분배금을 롤오버한 것이 아니라면 롤오버하지 않은 금액 중 과세 대상인 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4b에 입력하십시오. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 4b 옆에 “‘Rollover’”를 기입하십시오. 자세한 정보는 양식 1040의 지침을 참조하십시오.
분배금을 IRA 외 적격 플랜에 롤오버했거나 2025년에 해당 롤오버를 수행하는 경우, 이러한 내용을 설명하는 내역서를 첨부하십시오.
#### 고용주 플랜에서 IRA로 롤오버
본인 또는 사망한 배우자의 다음 플랜에서 받은 적격 롤오버 분배금 전액 또는 일부를 전통적 IRA에 롤오버할 수 있습니다.
  * 고용주의 적격 은퇴 연금, 이익 공유 또는 주식 보너스 플랜,
  * 연금 플랜,
  * 세금 감면 연금 플랜 (섹션 403 (b) 플랜), 또는
  * 정부의 이연 보상 플랜 (섹션 457 플랜).


적격 플랜은 국세법 요건에 부합하는 플랜입니다.
**적격 롤오버 분배금.**
일반적으로, 적격 롤오버 분배금은 다음을 제외하고 잔고 전액 또는 일부를 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜의 적립금으로 변환하는 것입니다.
  1. 필수 최저 분배금 (뒷부분 [_IRA 자산 인출 시점 (필수 최저 분배금)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172748 "IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 \(필수 최저 분배금\)")).
  2. 긴급 인출.
  3. 다음 기간 동안 한 번 이상 대체로 동일한 주기로 연쇄 인출한 바 있음:
    1. 전 생애 또는 기대 수명,
    2. 귀하와 수혜자의 생애 또는 기대 수명, 혹은
    3. 10년 이상.
  4. 과잉 기여금액 또는 과잉 이연에 대한 교정적 분배금 및 과잉에 할당 가능한 소득 또는 과잉 연간 증가액의 교정적 분배금 및 할당 가능 이득.
  5. 참여자의 적립 급여가 해당 대출을 상환하기 위해 감소 (상계)되지 않은 한 대출 시점 또는 이후에 특정 요건을 충족하지 못하여 (불이행 등) 분배금으로 처리된 대출. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A에서 _롤오버 기여 시한_ 의 _플랜 대출 상계_ 를 참조하십시오.
  6. 고용주 유가증권 배당금.
  7. 생명보험 보장 비용.


전통적 IRA로의 롤오버에는 롤오버가 아닌 인출 시 과세 대상 금액과 그렇지 않은 금액이 모두 포함될 수 있습니다. 해당 분배금이 전통적 IRA로 롤오버되었다면 귀하의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 전통적 IRA로 롤오버한 비과세 금액은 IRA 기초 원가의 일부가 됩니다. IRA를 인출했을 때 기초 원가를 회수하려면 인출하는 연도에 대한 양식 8606을 작성해야 합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 전액 또는 일부 과세 대상 분배금에서_[양식 8606](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172770 "양식 8606.") _을 참조하십시오._.
**배우자 외 수혜자에 의한 롤오버.**
귀하를 대신하여 분배금을 받기 위해 사망한 직원의 적격 연금, 이익 공유, 또는 주식 보너스 플랜, 연금 플랜, 세금 감면 연금 (섹션 403(b)) 플랜, 또는 정부의 이연 보상 (섹션 457) 플랜에서 IRA로 직접 양도하는 경우 귀하가 해당 플랜의 지정된 수혜자이며 해당 직원의 배우자가 아니라면 적격 롤오버 분배금으로 처리될 수 있습니다. IRA는 유산으로 받은 IRA로 처리됩니다. 유산으로 받은 IRA에 관한 자세한 정보는 앞서 소개한 [_유산으로 받은 IRA_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172688 "유산으로 받은 IRA")를 참고하십시오.
**고용주 플랜에서 롤오버 신고.**
양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4a에 전체 분배금 금액 (소득세 또는 기타 공제 원천징수 전)을 입력하십시오. 이 금액은 양식 1099-R, ‘연금, 은퇴 혹은 수익 공유 플랜, IRA 보험 계약 등에서의 분배금’의 박스 1에 표시되어야 합니다. 이 금액에서 인출 시 과세 대상이었던 금액 (일반적으로 양식 1099-R 박스 5에 표시)을 제합니다. 계산 결과에서 직접 또는 분배금 수령일로부터 60일 이내에 롤오버한 금액을 제합니다. 결과가 0이더라도 나머지 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 4b에 입력하십시오. 또한 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 4b 옆에 “Rollover”(롤오버)를 기입하십시오.
#### 이혼에 따른 양도
이혼 또는 별거 생활 유지 판결이나 이러한 판결에 관한 서면 문서에 의해 귀하의 배우자 또는 전 배우자에게서 전통적 IRA 권리가 양도되는 경우, 양도일로부터 시작되는 IRA 권리는 귀하의 IRA로 간주됩니다. 이러한 양도는 면세입니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A에서 _고용주 플랜에서 IRA로 롤오버의 이혼이나 유사한 절차 (대체 수취인)에 따른 분배금_ 을 참조하십시오.
#### 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 변환
**허용 가능 변환.**
60일 이내에 Roth IRA에 롤오버하는 경우 전통적 IRA의 자산 전체 또는 일부를 세금 없이 인출할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 인출하여 기한 내에 Roth IRA에 기여 (변환)한 금액은 변환 기여라고 합니다. 기한 내에 적절하게 롤오버된 경우 조기 분배금에 대한 10% 추가 세금은 적용되지 않습니다. 하지만 귀하의 전통적 IRA의 변환 기여 전액 또는 일부가 총소득에 포함됩니다. 
**필수 분배금.**
뒤에서 다룰 [필수 최저 분배금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172748 "IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 \(필수 최저 분배금\)") 규정에 따라 특정 연도 (귀하의 나이가 만 73세가 되는 일반 연도 포함)에 전통적 IRA에서 반드시 인출해야 하는 금액은 변환할 수 없습니다. 
**소득.**
귀하의 소득에 포함되어야 하는 전통적 IRA 분배금을 Roth IRA로 변환하지 않은 경우 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 이러한 금액은 일반적으로 전통적 IRA를 Roth IRA로 변환한 연도의 신고서에 소득으로 포함됩니다. 
뒤에서 설명하는 내용과 같이 전통적 IRA 분배금 중 [기초 원가를 반환](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172769 "부분 과세 대상.")을 반환하는 금액은 총소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 
2024년에 전통적 IRA, SEP, SIMPLE IRA를 Roth IRA로 변환했음을 신고하고 (전체 금액을 재분류한 경우는 제외) 소득에 포함시킬 금액을 계산하기 위해 양식 8606을 제출해야 합니다.
총소득에 포함시킬 금액이 있는 경우, 원천징수 금액을 높이거나 추정세를 지불해야 합니다. [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세")을 참조하십시오.
#### 재분류
하나의 IRA 유형에 납부한 기여를 다른 IRA 유형에 납부한 것으로 처리할 수도 있습니다. 이를 기여 재분류라고 합니다. 간행물 590-A의 1장, _은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부_ 에서 상세한 정보를 참조하십시오.
**기여 재분류 방법.**
기여를 재분류하려면, 일반적으로 수탁인 간 양도를 통해 첫 번째 IRA (기존에 기여를 납부한 IRA) 기여를 두 번째 IRA로 양도해야 합니다. 기여를 납부한 연도의 세금 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함) 내에 양도가 이루어진 경우, 해당 기여가 원래부터 첫 번째 IRA가 아닌 두 번째 IRA에 납부된 것으로 처리하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 기여를 재분류한 경우, 다음 세 가지 조치를 모두 취해야 합니다.
  * 해당 기여에 할당 가능한 순소득을 양도에 포함시킵니다. 손실이 존재하는 경우, 반드시 양도해야 할 순소득은 음수 금액일 것입니다. 
  * 기여를 납부한 연도에 대한 세금 신고서에 재분류를 신고하십시오.
  * 실제로는 첫 번째 IRA에 기여한 날짜에 해당 기여금이 원래부터 두 번째 IRA에 납부된 것으로 처리합니다. 


**2018년 또는 이후 변환 재분류 불가.**
2017년 과세 연도이후에 시작되는 과세 연도에 전통적 IRA를 Roth IRA로 변환하고 기타 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 Roth IRA로 롤오버하는 경우, 전통적 IRA에 기여한 것으로 재분류할 수 없습니다. 2017년 과세 연도에 변환한 경우, 해당 과세 연도의 세금 신고 기한 (연장 포함)까지 이를 재분류해야 합니다.
**공제 허용 불가.**
첫 번째 IRA에 기여한 금액을 공제할 수 없습니다. 재분류된 기여를 포함하여 양도한 순소득은 두 번째 IRA에서 발생한 것으로 처리합니다. 
**기여 재분류 방법**
기여를 재분류하려면, 첫 번째 IRA (실제로 기여를 납부한 IRA)의 수탁인과 두 번째 IRA (기여 금액을 이동할 IRA)의 수탁인 모두에게 해당 기여 금액이 첫 번째 IRA가 아닌 두 번째 IRA에 납부된 것으로 처리하기로 선택했다는 사실을 통지해야 합니다. 양도일까지 통지를 완료해야 합니다. 같은 수탁인이 두 가지 IRA를 모두 관리하는 경우 통지를 한 번만 해도 됩니다. 통지에는 다음 정보가 모두 포함되어야 합니다. 
  * 재분류할 첫 번째 IRA 기여의 유형과 금액.
  * 첫 번째 IRA 기여 날짜와 연도.
  * 수탁인 간 양도에서 기여 금액과 기여에 할당 가능한 순소득 (또는 손실)을 첫 번째 IRA 수탁인이 두 번째 IRA 수탁인에게 양도하기 위한 지침.
  * 첫 번째 IRA 수탁인과 두 번째 IRA 수탁인 이름.
  * 양도를 위해 필요한 추가 정보.


**재분류 신고.**
IRA 기여를 다른 IRA 기여로 재분류하기로 한 경우, 양식 8606과 그 지침에서 지시하는 바와 같이 세금 신고서에 재분류를 신고해야 합니다. 해당 기여를 두 번째 IRA에 납부한 것으로 처리해야 합니다. 
#### IRA 자산 인출 또는 이용 가능 시점
IRA 자산 및 분배금 이용을 제한하는 규정이 있습니다. 이러한 규정을 위반하면 일반적으로 위반한 연도에 추가 세금이 부과됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172777 "과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위")를 참조하십시오.
**세금 신고 기한 전 반환된 기여.**
귀하가 2024년 IRA 기여를 한 경우 세금 신고 기한까지 세금 없이 인출할 수 있습니다. 세금 신고 기한이 연장된 경우, 연장된 기한까지 세금 없이 인출할 수 있습니다. 매번 인출한 기여 금액이 다음 조건에 모두 해당할 경우에 위와 같이 할 수 있습니다. 
  * 기여 금액을 공제하지 않음.
  * 기여에서 발생한 이자나 기타 소득을 인출함. 반드시 인출해야 하는 금액을 계산할 때에는 기여 금액이 IRA에 존재한 동안 발생한 손실을 고려할 수 있습니다. 손실이 존재하는 경우, 기여에서 발생한 순소득은 음수 금액일 것입니다.


### 참고.
반드시 인출할 금액을 계산하려면 간행물 590-A의 1장, _자산 인출 또는 이용 가능 시점_ 의 워크시트 1-4를 참조하십시오.
_**소득에 포함될 수 있는 소득.**_
인출하는 기여에 발생한 소득을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 기여를 인출한 연도가 아닌 기여를 납부한 연도의 소득에 해당 소득을 포함시키십시오. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_일반적으로, 공제불가 기여 (기초 원가)를 반환하는 인출 금액의 일부를 제외하면 세금 신고 기한 (또는 연장 기한) 이후에 기여를 인출하면 과세 대상 분배금으로 처리됩니다. 과잉 기여금액은 뒤에서 다룰_[과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172777 "과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위") _에서 설명하는 바와 같이 세금 없이 회수할 수 있습니다._
**조기 인출 세금.**
만 59세½ 이전에 납부한 기여에 부과되는 10% 추가 세금은 위와 같이 세금 없이 기여를 인출하는 경우에는 적용되지 않습니다. 하지만 이자 또는 기타 소득 분배금은 양식 5329에 반드시 신고해야 하며, 만 59세½ 규정에서 [예외](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172799 "예외.") 자격에 해당하는 분배금이 아니라면 위의 세금에 해당합니다. 간행물 590-B의 _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위에서 조기 분배금_ 을 참조하십시오.
#### IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 (필수 최저 분배금)
귀하는 전통적 IRA에 자금을 무기한 보관할 수 없습니다. 결국 해당 금액을 인출해야 합니다. 인출하지 않거나 충분한 금액을 인출하지 않은 경우, 의무적으로 인출하지 않은 금액에 25% 특별세를 납부해야 합니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_과잉 누적 (불충분한 분배금)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172806 "과잉 누적 \(불충분한 분배금\)")을 참조하십시오. IRA 기금 인출 요건은 귀하가 IRA의 소유자인지 사망자의 부양 가족이 소유한 IRA의 수혜자인지에 따라 달라집니다.
**필수 최저 분배금.**
매년 반드시 인출해야 하는 금액을 “필수 최저 분배금”이라고 합니다.
**롤오버 자격에 해당하지 않는 분배금.**
특정 연도 중에 반드시 인출해야 하는 금액 (필수 최저 분배금)은 롤오버 처리 자격에 해당하지 않습니다.
**IRA 소유자.**
귀하가 전통적 IRA 소유자라면 일반적으로 만 72세가 되는 연도의 다음 해 4월 1일까지 IRA에서 분배금을 받기 시작해야 합니다. 귀하가 만 73세가 되는 연도의 다음 해 4월 1일을 “필수 개시일”이라고 합니다. 
**필수 개시일까지의 분배금.**
귀하는 만 73세가 되는 연도 다음년 4월 1일부터 시작하여 매년 최저 금액 이상을 수령해야 합니다. 73번째 생일이 돌아오는 해에 최저 금액을 받지 않은 경우 다음 해 4월 1일까지 73세가 된 해에 해당하는 분배금을 반드시 받아야 합니다.
IRA 소유자가 만 73세 생일 이후 다음 해 4월 1일 이전에 사망한 경우, 필수 개시일 이전에 사망하였으므로 최저 분배금이 요구되지 않습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2022년 12월 31일 이후에 72세가 된 사람은 73세가 되는 연도의 다음해 4월 1일까지 필수 최소 분배금의 수령을 지연할 수 있습니다._.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_만 72세가 되기 이전에 분배금을 받기 시작하더라도 필수 개시일까지 필수 최저 분배금을 계산하여 수령하기 시작해야 합니다._.
_**필수 개시일 이후의 분배금.**_
만 72세가 된 연도가 지나서 필수 최저 분배금을 받을 경우, 이후 연도의 12월 31일까지 반드시 인출해야 합니다. 
**수혜자.**
사망자의 부양 가족이 소유한 전통적 IRA의 수혜자일 경우, 해당 IRA의 인출 요건은 일반적으로 IRA 소유자의 사망 시점이 필수 인출 개시일 이전인지 이후인지에 따라 달라집니다. 
**추가 정보.**
연도별 필수 최저 분배금을 계산하는 방법 및 사망자의 부양 가족이 소유한 IRA의 수혜자일 경우 필수 최소 분배금을 계산하는 방법 등 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B의 1장에서 _자산 인출 시기 (필수 최저 분배금)_ 을 참조하십시오.
#### 분배금의 과세 대상 여부
일반적으로 전통적 IRA 분배금은 수령한 연도에 과세 대상입니다.
**예외.**
수령한 연도에 과세 대상인 전통적 IRA 분배금의 예외는 다음과 같습니다.
  * 뒤에서 논의하는 롤오버,
  * 앞에서 소개한 [적격 자선 분배금 (QCD)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100047926 "적격 자선 분배금 \(QCD\)."),
  * 앞서 소개된 [분배금 중 세금 면제 금액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172741 "세금 신고 기한 전 반환된 기여.")
  * 뒷부분 [_전액 또는 부분 과세 대상 분배금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172766 "전액 또는 부분 과세 대상 분배금")에서 소개하는 공제불가 기여 반환.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_전통적 IRA 변환이 Roth IRA 목적에서 롤오버로 간주되더라도 전통적 IRA 분배금은 수령한 연도에 과세 대상이라는 규정에 대한 예외는 아닙니다. 변환 분배금은 총소득에 포함되며, 이 규정과 간행물 590-A 1장, 은퇴 연금 플랜 자산 이동 가능 여부의 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 변환에서 설명하는 변환에 대한 특별 규정이 적용됩니다._.
**적격 자선 분배금 (QCD).**
QCD는 귀하의 IRA 수탁인이 세금 공제 가능한 기여를 받을 자격이 있는 기관으로 직접 인출하는 경우 일반적으로 비과세 분배금입니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B, _적격 자선 분배금_ 을 참조하십시오.

**경상 소득.**
소득에 포함되는 전통적 IRA 분배금은 경상 소득으로 과세됩니다.
**특별 처리 비적용.**
세금 계산, 시 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜 일시 분배금에 적용되는 10년 세금 옵션이나 자본이득 처리를 사용할 수 없습니다.
#### 전액 또는 부분 과세 대상 분배금
전통적 IRA 분배금은 IRA에 공제불가 기여가 포함되었는지 여부에 따라 전액 또는 부분 과세 대상입니다.
**전액 과세 대상.**
전통적 IRA (하나 이상인 경우 복수 IRA)에 공제 가능한 기여만 납부한 경우, IRA 기초 원가가 존재하지 않습니다. IRA 기초 원가가 없으므로, 수령한 분배금은 전액 과세 대상입니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_과세 대상 분배금 세금 신고_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172776 "과세 대상 분배금 세금 신고.")를 참조하십시오. 
**부분 과세 대상.**
전통적 IRA로 공제불가 기여를 납부하거나 세후 금액을 롤오버한 경우, 기초 원가 (투자 금액)이 해당 기여 금액과 같아집니다. 이러한 공제불가 기여는 인출 시 과세되지 않습니다. 귀하가 IRA에 투자한 금액을 반환하는 것이기 때문입니다.
분배금 중 공제불가 기여 및 세후 금액을 롤오버한 금액 (기초 원가)만 면세입니다. 귀하의 IRA에 공제불가 기여를 납부했거나 세후 금액을 롤오버한 경우, 분배금의 일부는 공제불가 기여 (기초 원가)로, 나머지는 공제 가능한 기여, 소득 및 이득 (존재하는 경우)으로 구성됩니다. 귀하의 기초 원가 전체가 인출되기 전에는 각 분배금의 일부는 비과세이며 나머지는 과세 대상입니다. 
**양식 8606.**
전통적 IRA에서 분배금을 받고 전통적 IRA에 공제불가 기여를 납부했거나 세후 금액을 롤오버했다면 양식 8606을 작성하여 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 이 양식을 사용하여 2024년 비과세 분배금과 2024년 및 이전 연도의 IRA 기초 원가 전체를 계산할 수 있습니다.
### 참고.
양식 8606을 제출해야 하지만 소득세 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 되는 경우에도 양식 8606을 반드시 제출해야 합니다. 소득세 신고 기한 및 제출 주소에 따라 해당 양식을 IRS로 송부하십시오.
**양식 1099-R에서 신고하는 분배금.**
전통적 IRA에서 분배금을 받은 경우 양식 1099-R, 또는 유사한 내역서를 받을 것입니다. IRA 분배금은 양식 1099-R의 박스 1과 2a에 표시됩니다. 박스 7의 숫자나 문자 코드를 통해 IRA에서 수령한 분배금 유형을 알 수 있습니다. 
**원천징수.**
귀하가 원천징수를 선택하지 않은 경우가 아니라면, 전통적 IRA 분배금에서 연방 소득세가 원천징수됩니다. [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink100032323 "세금 원천징수 및 추정세")을 참조하십시오. 
_**미국 외 국가로 전달된 IRA 분배금.**_
일반적으로 귀하가 미국 시민이거나 거주 외국인이고 주소지가 미국 또는 영토 밖에 있는 경우 전통적 IRA 분배금에 대한 세금 원천징수 면제를 선택할 수 없습니다. 
**과세 대상 분배금 세금 신고.**
조기 분배금을 포함하여 전체 과세 대상 분배금을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4b에 신고하십시오 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4a에는 기입하지 않아도 됩니다). 분배금의 일부만 과세 대상인 경우 전체 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4a에 기입하고 과세 대상 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR, 라인 4b에 기입합니다.
#### 과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위
은퇴 예금에 전통적 IRA를 사용할 때 세금상 이점은 해당 규정을 준수하지 않는 경우 부과되는 추가 세금 및 과징금로 상쇄될 수 있습니다.
귀하의 IRA 기금을 금지된 거래에 사용할 때 정규 세금에 추가로 부과됩니다. 다음 활동에도 추가 세금이 부과됩니다.
  * 수집품 투자.
  * 관련 없는 사업 소득 보유. 간행물 590-B를 참조하십시오.
  * 과잉 기여금액.
  * 조기 인출.
  * 허용 가능한 과잉 누적 금액 (필수 인출 불이행 시).


공제불가 기여 금액의 과대 신고 및 필수 제출인 경우 양식 8606 미제출에 대한 과징금이 부과됩니다.
#### 금지된 거래
일반적으로 금지된 거래는 귀하나 수혜자 또는 부적격 대상이 귀하의 전통적 IRA를 부적절하게 사용하는 것을 의미합니다.
부적격 대상자에는 귀하의 수탁자와 가족 구성원 (배우자, 직계 존속, 직계 비속 및 직계 비속의 배우자)가 포함됩니다.
다음은 전통적 IRA를 이용한 금지된 거래의 예시입니다.
  * 전통적 IRA에서 금전 대출. 간행물 590-B를 참조하십시오.
  * IRA에 재산 매도.
  * 대출 담보로 사용.
  * IRA 기금을 사용하여 현재 또는 미래의 개인 용도로 재산 매수.


**IRA 계좌에 미치는 영향.**
일반적으로 귀하의 수혜자가 해당 연도 중 귀하의 전통적 IRA 계좌와 관련하여 금지된 거래에 연루되었다면, 해당 계정의 IRA 기능이 해당 연도의 첫 날짜를 기준으로 정지됩니다. 
**귀하 또는 수혜자에게 미치는 경향.**
귀하나 수혜자가 금지된 거래에 연루되어 계정이 IRA 기능이 정지되는 경우, 해당 계정은 모든 자산을 해당 연도 첫 날짜의 공정 시장 가격으로 귀하에게 인출한 것으로 처리됩니다. 해당 자산의 가격 총액이 IRA 기초 원가를 초과하는 경우 귀하는 소득에 포함 가능한 과세 대상 이득을 보유하게 됩니다. 이득 계산 및 신고에 관한 정보는 앞에 소개된 [_분배금 과세 대상 여부_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172758 "분배금의 과세 대상 여부")를 참조하십시오. 분배금에는 추가 세금이나 과징금이 부과될 수 있습니다.
**금지된 거래에 부과되는 세금.**
전통적 IRA의 소유자 또는 수혜자가 아닌 사람이 금지된 거래에 연루된 경우, 해당 사람에게 특정 세금이 부과될 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 금지된 거래 금액에 15% 세금이 부과되며, 해당 거래를 시정하지 않는 경우 추가 세금 100%가 부과됩니다. 
**추가 정보.**
금지된 거래에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A의 1장, _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 수집품 투자
귀하의 전통적 IRA로 수집품에 투자한 경우, 투자 금액은 투자를 실행한 연도에 귀하에게 인출된 것으로 간주됩니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [조기 분배금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172795 "조기 분배금")에 부과되는 추가 세금 10%를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다.
**수집품.**
다음 목록이 수집품에 해당합니다.
  * 예술품,
  * 양탄자,
  * 골동품,
  * 금속,
  * 보석,
  * 우표,
  * 동전,
  * 주류 및
  * 기타 유형 개인 재산.


_**예외.**_
귀하의 IRA로 미국 재무부에서 주조한 1 온스, 0.5 온스, 0.25 온스 또는 0.1 온스 미국 금화 또는 1 온스 은화에 투자할 수 있습니다. 또한 특정 백금 동전 및 특정 금괴, 은괴, 팔라듐괴 및 백금괴에 투자할 수 있습니다. 
#### 과잉 기여금액
일반적으로 과잉 기여금액은 해당 연도에 전통적 IRA에 기여한 금액 중 다음 중 더 적은 금액을 초과한 금액입니다.
  * 해당 연도에 공제 가능한 최고 금액. (2024년 기준, $7,000 (만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)), 또는
  * 해당 연도의 과세 대상 기여.


귀하의 기여, 배우자의 기여, 고용주의 기여, 또는 부적절한 롤오버 기여로 인해 과잉 기여금액이 발생할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 고용주가 귀하 대신 SEP IRA에 기여하는 경우, 간행물 560의 2장을 참고하십시오.
**과잉 기여금액 세금.**
일반적으로 해당 연도의 과잉 기여금액을 해당 연도 세금 신고 기한 (기한 연장 포함)까지 인출하지 않는 경우 세금 6%가 부과됩니다. 과세 연도 말을 기준으로 전통적 IRA에 존재하는 과잉 금액에 대해 매년 6% 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 세금은 과세 연도 말을 기준으로 전체 IRA의 합산 금액의 6%를 초과할 수 없습니다. 추가 세금은 양식 5329에서 계산합니다. 
**세금 신고 기한까지 인출한 과잉 기여금액.**
해당 과세 연도 중 납부한 과잉 기여금액을 인출하고 과잉 기여금액에서 발생한 이자나 다른 소득도 인출하는 경우 6% 세금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 기한 연장을 포함하여 해당 연도의 세금 세금 신고 기한까지 인출을 완료해야 합니다. 
_**인출한 기여금 취급 방법.**_
다음 조건에 모두 부합하는 경우 세금 신고서 제출 전에 전통적 IRA에서 인출한 과잉 기여금액을 귀하의 총소득에 포함시키지 마십시오. 
  * 과잉 기여금액에 대한 공제가 허용되지 않은 경우.
  * 과잉 기여금액에서 발생한 이자나 기타 소득을 인출한 경우. 


반드시 인출해야 하는 금액을 계산할 때에는 기여 금액이 IRA에 존재한 동안 발생한 손실을 고려할 수 있습니다. 손실이 존재하는 경우, 반드시 인출해야 할 순소득은 음수 금액일 것입니다. 
2022년 12월 29일 이후, 소득세 신고 마감일전에 (연장 포함) 이자 혹은 기타 소득을 인출한 경우, 인출에 대한 10% 추가 세금이 적용되지 않습니다. 간행물 590–B를 참조하십시오.
_**인출한 이자 또는 기타 소득 처리 방법.**_
귀하는 과잉 기여금액에서 발생한 이자 또는 기타 소득을 귀하의 총소득에 반드시 포함시켜야 합니다. 과잉 기여금액을 납부한 연도에 대한 세금 신고서에 신고하십시오. 이자 또는 기타 소득 인출에 따라 뒤에서 다룰 [조기 인출](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172795 "조기 분배금")에 부과되는 10% 추가 세금이 적용될 수 있습니다. 
**세금 신고 기한 이후에 인출한 과잉 기여금액.**
일반적으로 전통적 IRA의 모든 분배금은 귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 하지만 다음 조건에 부합하는 경우 IRA에서 과잉 기여금액을 인출한 후 총소득에 인출 금액을 포함시키지 않을 수 있습니다. 
  * 2024년 총 기여 금액 (롤오버 기여 제외)이 $7,000 (만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)를 초과한 경우.
  * 인출하는 과잉 기여금액을 공제하지 않은 경우.


인출은 기한 연장을 포함한 해당 연도의 세금 세금 신고 기한 이후에도 언제든지 실행할 수 있습니다. 
**전년도에 공제한 과잉 기여금액.**
전년도에 과잉 기여금액을 공제했고 전체 기여 금액이 해당 연도에 공제 가능한 최대 금액을 초과하지 않은 경우 (아래 표 참고), 전통적 IRA에서 과잉 기여금액을 제거하고 총소득에 포함시키지 않을 수 있습니다. 이를 위해, 해당 연도에 대한 양식 1040-X를 제출하고 수정된 신고서에서 과잉 기여금액을 공제하지 마십시오. 일반적으로, 신고서 제출 후 3년 이내 또는 세금 납부 시점으로부터 2년 이내 중 더 늦은 기한까지 수정된 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 
**연도** | **기여 한도** | **해당 연도 말 기준 만 50세 이상인 경우 기여 한도**  
---|---|---  
2023년 | $6,500 | $7,500  
2019년~2022년 | $6,000 | $7,000  
2013년~2018년 | $5,500 | $6,500  
2008~2012년 | $5,000 | $6,000  
2006년 또는 2007년 | $4,000 | $5,000  
2005년 | $4,000 | $4,500  
2002~2004년 | $3,000 | $3,500  
1997~2001년 | $2,000 | —  
1997년 이전 | $2,250 | —  
**부정확한 롤오버 정보로 인한 과잉.**
전통적 IRA 과잉 기여금액이 롤오버 결과로 발생하였으며 플랜에서 필수로 제공해야 하는 정보가 부정확하여 이러한 과잉이 발생한 경우, 과잉 기여금액을 인출할 수 있습니다. 위에서 언급한 한도는 부정확한 정보로 발생한 과잉 금액까지 증가합니다. 귀하는 과잉이 발생한 연도의 신고서를 수정하여 해당 연도의 롤오버 금액 신고를 정정해야 합니다. 부정확한 정보로 발생한 과잉 기여금액 금액은 귀하의 총소득에 포함시키지 마십시오. 과잉 기여금액에 관한 더 많은 정보는 간행물 590-A에서 _과징금나 추가 세금을 초래하는 행위_ 에 포함된 _과잉 기여금액_ 를 참조하십시오. 
#### 조기 분배금
전통적 IRA의 과세 대상 금액에 대한 조기 분배금을 귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 조기 분배금은 10% 추가 세금에도 해당됩니다. 해당 세금을 계산하여 신고하려면 뒤에서 다룰 [_추가 세금 신고_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172811 "추가 세금 신고")에서 양식 5329의 지침을 참조하십시오.
**조기 분배금 정의.**
조기 분배금은 일반적으로 만 59세½ 이전 전통적 IRA 계좌 또는 연금에서 인출한 금액을 의미합니다. 
**만 59세½ 규정.**
일반적으로 만 59세½ 미만인 경우 전통적 IRA에서 자산 (현금 또는 기타 재산)을 인출할 때 10% 추가 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 만 59세½ 이전에 받은 분배금을 조기 분배금이라고 합니다.
귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 하는 분배금에 10% 추가 세금이 적용됩니다. 이는 해당 금액에 부과되는 정규 소득세에 추가되는 세금입니다. 
_**만 59세½ 초과 및 만 73세 미만.**_
만 59세½가 된 이후에는 10% 추가 세금 납부 없이 분배금을 받을 수 있습니다. 만 59세½가 된 이후에 분배금을 받을 수 있더라도 만 73세가 되기 전까지는 반드시 인출하지 않아도 됩니다. 앞에 소개된 [_IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 (필수 최저 분배금)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172748 "IRA 자산 의무 인출 시점 \(필수 최저 분배금\)")을 참고하십시오.
_**예외.**_
만 59세½ 규정에는 여러 예외가 있습니다. 만 59세½ 이전에 분배금을 수령하더라도 다음 상황 중 하나에 해당하는 경우 10% 추가 세금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
  * AGI의 7.5% 를 초과하는 미변제 의료 비용이 발생했을 경우.
  * 분배금이 실업 기간으로 인해 의료 보험 비용을 위한 것인 경우.

이러한 예외는 대부분 간행물 590-B 1장, _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_ 의 _조기 분배금_ 에서 설명하고 있습니다.
### 비고.
앞서 소개한대로 기한 내에 적절하게 [롤오버](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172698 "롤오버")한 분배금은 정규 소득세 또는 10% 추가 세금에 해당하지 않습니다. 세금 신고 기한 이후에 진행한 특정 과잉 기여금액 인출도 세금이 면제되므로 10% 추가 세금에 해당하지 않습니다. (앞서 소개한 [_신고서 제출 기한 이후에 인출한 과잉 기부액을_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172792 "세금 신고 기한 이후에 인출한 과잉 기여금액.") 참고하십시오.) 이는 앞서 소개한 [이혼에 따른 양도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172727 "이혼에 따른 양도")에도 적용됩니다. 
_**법정관리 분배금.**_
법정관리 중인 저축기관에서 (귀하의 동의 여부와 관계 없이) 받은 조기 분배금은 앞서 열거한 예외가 하나라도 적용되지 않는 한 이러한 세금에 해당됩니다. 법정관리인인 주 정부기관에서 인출한 금액이더라도 이 규정이 적용됩니다.
**10% 추가 세금.**
귀하의 총소득에 포함시켜야 하는 조기 분배금의 10%가 조기 인출에 대한 추가 세금으로 부과됩니다. 이 세금은 분배금을 소득에 포함시키는 것에 따른 정규 소득세에 추가로 부과됩니다. 
**공제불가 기여.**
조기 분배금에 대한 세금은 공제불가 기여 (기초 원가)을 반환하는 분배금에는 적용되지 않습니다.
**추가 정보.**
조기 분배금에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B의 1장, _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 과잉 누적 (불충분한 분배금)
귀하는 전통적 IRA에 금액을 무기한 보관할 수 없습니다. 일반적으로 만 73세가 되는 연도 다음 해 4월 1일까지는 분배금 수령을 개시해야 합니다. 만 73세가 된 연도가 지난 경우 필수 최저 분배금은 그 해 12월 31일까지 반드시 수령해야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2022년 12월 31일 이후에 72세가 된 사람은 73세가 되는 연도의 다음해 4월 1일까지 필수 최소 분배금의 수령을 지연할 수 있습니다._.
**과잉 금액에 대한 세금.**
해당 연도의 분배금이 필수 최저 분배금보다 적은 경우 인출하지 않은 필수 금액에 대해 25% 특별세를 납부해야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_필수 최소 분배에 미달하는 배분에 대한 특별세는 2022년 12월 29일 이후 시작하는 과세연도부터 25%로 감소됩니다. 또한 추가적인 요건에 부합하는 납세자에 대해서 추가적인 10% 감소가 있습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 간행물 590-B을 참조하십시오._.
**세금 면제 요청.**
합리적인 오류로 과잉 누적이 발생했고 불충분한 분배금을 시정하기 위한 단계를 취했거나 이를 수행하고 있는 경우, 세금 면제를 신청할 수 있습니다. 이러한 구제 자격에 해당한다고 생각하는 경우, 양식 5329 지침의 _타당한 이유로 인한 세금 면제_ 에서 설명한대로 지침을 첨부하고 양식 5329를 작성해야 합니다.
**세금 면제.**
주 정부 보험회사의 연체 절차 중에 있는 보험 회사가 발행한 계약에 전통적 IRA를 투자하여 필수 분배금 수령을 진행할 수 없는 경우, 세무 절차 92-10의 조건과 요건이 충족된다면 25% 특별세가 적용되지 않습니다.
**추가 정보.**
과잉 누적에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B의 1장, _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 추가 세금 신고
일반적으로 양식 5329를 사용하여 과잉 기여금액 세금, 조기 분배금 세금, 과잉 누적 세금을 신고해야 합니다.
**세금 신고서 제출.**
개인 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 하는 경우 양식 5329를 작성하여 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 첨부하십시오. 추가 세금 총액을 스케줄 2 (양식 1040), 라인 8에 포함시키십시오. 
**세금 신고서 미제출.**
세금 신고서를 제출하지 않아도 되지만 앞서 설명한 추가 세금 중 납부해야 하는 세금이 있다면, 양식 5329를 작성하여 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 제출 기한 및 장소에 따라 IRS에 제출하십시오. 주소를 1페이지에, 서명과 날짜를 2페이지에 기입하십시오. 양식 5329에서 표시한 바와 같이 납부할 세금에 대해 “United States Treasury” (미국 재무부)를 수취인으로 한 수표나 우편환을 동봉하되 양식에 붙이지 마십시오. 수표 또는 우편환에 귀하의 사회 보장 번호와 “2024 Form 5239” (2024년 양식 5329)를 기재해주십시오. 
**양식 5329 불필요.**
다음 상황 중 하나에 해당한다면 양식 5329를 사용하지 않아도 됩니다.
  * 귀하의 전체 양식 1099-R의 박스 7에 분배금 코드 1 (조기 분배금)이 정확하게 표시된 경우. 분배금에 납부할 기타 추가 세금이 없는 경우, 조기 분배금의 과세 대상 금액에 10% (0.10)를 곱하고 계산 결과를 스케줄 2 (양식 1040), 라인 8에 기입하십시오. 귀하가 양식 5329를 제출하지 않아도 된다는 점을 표시하기 위해 줄 왼쪽에 “No” (아니요)를 기입하십시오. 하지만 이 세금 및 분배금에 대한 다른 추가 세금을 납부해야 하는 경우, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 10% 추가 세금을 직접 기입하지 마십시오. 추가 세금을 신고하기 위해 양식 5329를 제출해야 합니다. 
  * 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 분배금 전액 또는 일부를 롤오버한 경우, 롤오버 금액은 조기 분배금에 부과되는 세금에 해당하지 않습니다. 
  * 적격 재난 분배금이 있는 경우.


#### Roth IRA
나이와 관계 없이 Roth IRA라고 하는 은퇴 연금 플랜을 개설하여 공제불가 기여를 납부할 수 있습니다.
**신고하지 않는 기여.**
Roth IRA 기여는 신고서에 기재하지 않습니다. 
#### Roth IRA의 정의
Roth IRA는 이 장에서 설명된 것 외에 앞서 정의한 [전통적 IRA](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172589 "전통적 IRA")에 해당하는 규정이 적용되는 개인 은퇴 연금 플랜입니다. 계정이나 연금의 형태가 될 수 있습니다. 개인 퇴직 계정과 연금은 간행물 590-A 1장, _전통적 IRA 개설 방법_ 아래에서 설명하고 있습니다.
Roth IRA에 해당하려면 계정이나 연금 개설 시 Roth IRA로 지정해야 합니다. 과세연도 2023년을 시작으로 SEP IRA 또는 SIMPLE IRA를 둘다 Roth IRA로 지정할 수 있습니다.
전통적 IRA와 달리, Roth IRA 기여금은 공제할 수 없습니다. 하지만 요건을 충족하는 경우 앞서 설명한 [적격 분배금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172866 "적격 분배금 정의") (나중에 설명됨)은 면세입니다.귀하가 생존하는 기간 동안 Roth IRA에 금액을 남겨둘 수 있습니다.
#### Roth IRA 개설 가능 시점
Roth IRA는 언제든지 개설할 수 있습니다. 하지만 어떤 연도이든 기여 시점은 제한되어 있습니다. 다음 소개될 _Roth IRA 기여 가능 여부_ 에서 [_기여 가능 시점_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172840 "기여 가능 시점")을 참조하십시오.
#### Roth IRA 기여 가능 여부
일반적으로 뒤에서 정의할 [과세 대상 보수](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172826 "보수.")가 있고 뒤에서 정의할 [변경된 AGI](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172827 "수정된 AGI.")가 다음 금액보다 적은 경우 Roth IRA에 기여할 수 있습니다.
  * 부부 공동 신고 또는 적격 생존 배우자의 경우 $240,000,
  * 미혼, 세대주, 또는 부부 개별 신고로서 해당 연도에 배우자와 함께 살지 않은 경우 $161,000,
  * 부부 개별 신고이며 해당 연도 중에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있을 경우 $10,000.


.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_귀하의 Roth IRA 기여에 세액 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590–A의 3장을 참조하십시오._.
**기여 나이 제한 여부**
Roth IRA에는 나이와 관계 없이 기여할 수 있습니다. 
**배우자를 위한 Roth IRA 기여 가능 여부**
해당 기여가 _전통적 IRA_ 에서 앞서 설명한 [_기여 가능 금액_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172599 "기여 가능 금액") 에서 소개한 바와 같이 Kay Bailey Hutchison 배우자 IRA 한도를 충족하고, 부부 공동 신고를 하며, 수정된 AGI가 $240,000 미만인 경우, 배우자를 위해 Roth IRA에 기여할 수 있습니다.
**보수.**
보수에는 임금, 연봉, 팁, 전문 수수료, 보너스 및 개인 서비스를 제공하여 받는 기타 금액이 포함됩니다. 또한 커미션, 자영업 소득, 비과세 전투 수당, 군인 특별 수당, 과세 대상 위자료 및 별거 생활 유지비, 그리고 과세 대상 비학비 연구 지원금 및 급여도 포함됩니다. 
더 많은 정보를 보려면 이전에 나온 _[보수란 무엇인가?](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172592 "보수란 무엇인가?")_ 를 참조하십시오.
**수정된 AGI.**
Roth IRA 목적에서 수정된 AGI는 귀하의 신고서에 일부 조정 사항을 포함하여 표시되는 조정총소득 (AGI)입니다. [워크시트 9-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172828 "워크시트 9-2. Roth IRA 목적에 적용하는 수정된 AGI")를 사용하여 수정된 AGI를 계산하십시오.

(사회보장 혜택을 받는 경우 간행물 590-A _부록 B_ 의 워크시트 1을 사용하여 AGI를 다시 계산하십시오.) 그 다음 워크시트 9-2 위쪽 라인 3으로 이동하여 수정된 AGI를 다시 계산하십시오. AGI 기준 단계적 삭감에 해당하는 기타 소득 또는 손실 항목이 없는 경우, Roth IRA에 적용되는 수정된 AGI는 라인 10에 표시되는 금액입니다.  
#### 기여 가능 금액
Roth IRA 기여 한도는 일반적으로 Roth IRA에만 기여했는지 전통적 IRA와 Roth IRA에 모두 기여했는지에 따라 달라집니다.
**Roth IRA에만 기여한 경우.**
Roth IRA에만 기여한 경우, 일반적으로 다음 중 더 적은 금액이 기여 한도입니다.
  * $7,000 (2024년에 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000). 
  * 과세 대상 기여.


하지만 수정된 AGI가 특정 금액을 초과하는 경우, 뒷부분 [_기여 한도 삭감_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172836 "기여 한도 삭감.")에서 설명한대로 기여 한도가 삭감될 수 있습니다. 
**Roth IRA 및 전통적 IRA.**
급여를 위해 개설한 Roth IRA와 전통적 IRA에 모두 기여한 경우 Roth IRA 기여 한도는 일반적으로 Roth IRA에만 기여했을 때의 한도와 같지만, 해당 연도에 Roth IRA를 제외한 IRA 전체에 기여한 금액만큼 삭감됩니다. SEP 또는 SIMPLE IRA에 납부한 고용주 기여는 한도에 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
즉, 다음 중 더 적은 금액이 일반적으로 귀하의 기여 한도입니다.
  * $7,000 (2024년에 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)에서 해당 연도에 Roth IRA를 제외한 모든 IRA에 기여한 모든 금액 (SEP 또는 SIMPLE IRA에서 고용주가 기여한 금액 제외)을 제한 금액.
  * 과세 대상 기여에서 해당 연도에 Roth IRA 외 다른 모든 IRA에 기여한 전체 금액 (SEP 또는 SIMPLE IRA에 따라 고용주가 기여한 금액 제외). 


하지만 수정된 AGI가 특정 금액을 초과하는 경우, 다음에 _기여 한도 삭감_ 에서 설명한대로 기여 한도가 삭감될 수 있습니다.
**기여 한도 삭감.**
수정된 AGI가 특정 금액을 초과하는 경우 기여 한도가 점진적으로 삭감됩니다. 해당 삭감이 적용되는 경우 [표 9-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172837 "표 9–3. 수정된 AGI가 Roth IRA 기여에 미치는 영향")을 사용하여 계산합니다. 
##### 표 9–3. 수정된 AGI가 Roth IRA 기여에 미치는 영향
> _이 표는 수정된 AGI 금액이 Roth IRA 기여에 영향을 미치는지를 표시합니다_.  
---  
귀하의 과세 대상 기여 및 납세자 구분 |  | 수정된 AGI |  | 결과  
---|---|---|---|---  
**부부 공동 신고** 또는 **적격 생존 배우자** |  | $230,000 미만 |  | 최대 $7,000 (2024년에 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)까지 기여 가능합니다.  
| $230,000 이상 $240,000 미만 |  | 간행물 590-A 2장, _기여 한도 삭감_ 에서 설명한대로 기여 금액이 삭감됩니다.  
| $240,000 이상 |  | Roth IRA에 기여할 수 없습니다.  
**부부 개별 신고** 를 하며 해당 연도 중에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있을 경우 |  | 없음 (-0-) |  | 최대 $7,000 (2024년에 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)까지 기여 가능합니다.  
| 0 초과 $10,000 미만 |  | 간행물 590-A 2장, _기여 한도 삭감_ 에서 설명한대로 기여 금액이 삭감됩니다.  
| $10,000 이상 |  | Roth IRA에 기여할 수 없습니다.  
**미혼,** **세대주** , 또는 **부부 개별 신고** 를 하며 해당 연도 중에 배우자와 함께 살았던 적이 있을 경우 |  | $146,000미만 |  | 최대 $7,000 (2024년에 만 50세 이상인 경우 $8,000)까지 기여 가능합니다.  
| $146,000이상 $161,000 미만 |  | 간행물 590-A 2장, _기여 한도 삭감_ 에서 설명한대로 기여 금액이 삭감됩니다.  
| $161,000 이상 |  | Roth IRA에 기여할 수 없습니다.  
_**삭감 계산.**_
Roth IRA에 기여할 수 있는 금액이 삭감된 경우 간행물 590-A 2장, _Roth IRA 기여 가능 여부_ 아래의 워크시트 2-2에서 삭감 계산 방법을 알아 보십시오.
#### 기여 가능 시점
Roth IRA 기여는 해당 연도 중 어느 때든 또는 해당 연도의 세금 신고 기한까지 (기한 연장 없이) 납부할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2024년 기여는 기한 연장 기한을 제외하고 2024년 세금 세금 신고 기한까지 납부할 수 있습니다._.
#### 기여 금액이 너무 많은 경우
6% 특별세가 Roth IRA 과잉 기여금액에 적용됩니다.
**과잉 기여금액.**
해당 연도에 다음 금액의 총액과 같은 금액으로 Roth IRA에 기여한 것을 의미합니다. 
  1. 과세 연도에 Roth IRA에 기여한 금액 중 해당 연도의 기여 한도를 초과한 금액 (기한 내에 Roth IRA에 적절하게 [롤오버한 금액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172861 "Roth IRA에서 롤오버") 또는 전통적 IRA에서 [적절하게 변환된 금액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172847 "변환") 또는 뒤에서 설명한대로 [적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 롤오버한 금액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172851 "적격 은퇴 연금 플랜을 Roth IRA로 롤오버.") 제외)과
  2. 이전 연도의 과잉 기여금액을 합산한 금액에서
    1. 해당 연도의 Roth IRA 분배금과
    2. 해당 연도의 기여 한도에서 해당 연도의 모든 IRA 기여 금액을 제한 금액의 합산 결과를 제한 금액.


_**과잉 기여금액 인출.**_
과잉 기여금액을 계산하기 위해 기한 연장을 포함하여 해당 연도 세금 세금 신고 기한 또는 그 전에 인출한 기여는 기여하지 않은 금액으로 처리합니다. 기여에서 발생한 소득도 인출한 경우에만 이러한 규정이 적용됩니다. 해당 소득은 과잉 기여금액을 납부한 연도에 발생하여 수령한 것으로 간주됩니다.
**과잉 기여금액 적용.**
어떤 연도에 한도를 초과하여 Roth IRA에 기여한 경우, 1년 뒤 기여 금액이 해당 연도에 허용되는 최고 금액 미만이라면 과잉 기여금액을 적용할 수 있습니다. 
#### Roth IRA로의 금액 이동 가능 여부
전통적, SEP, SIMPLE IRA의 금액을 Roth IRA로 변환할 수 있습니다. 또한 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 Roth IRA로 금액을 롤오버할 수도 있습니다. 하나의 IRA에 납부한 기여를 다른 IRA에 직접 납부한 것으로 재분류할 수 있습니다. 지정된 Roth 계좌 또는 하나의 Roth IRA에서 다른 Roth IRA로 금액을 롤오버할 수 있습니다.
#### 변환
전통적 IRA를 Roth IRA로 변환할 수 있습니다. 사용한 변환 방법과 관련 없이 이러한 변환을 롤오버로 처리합니다. 앞서 _전통적 IRA_ 의 [_다른 IRA로 롤오버_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172708 "다른 IRA로 롤오버")에서 설명한 롤오버 규정이 대부분 이러한 롤오버 사례에 적용됩니다. 하지만 1년 대기 기간은 적용되지 않습니다.
**변환 방법.**
다음 방법 중 하나를 사용하여 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 금액을 변환할 수 있습니다. 
  * 롤오버. 전통적 IRA 분배금을 수령하여 인출 날짜로부터 60일 이내에 Roth IRA로 롤오버 (기여)할 수 있습니다.
  * 수탁인 간 양도. 귀하는 전통적 IRA 수탁인에게 해당 IRA 금액을 Roth IRA 수탁인에게 양도하도록 지시할 수 있습니다.
  * 동일 수탁인 양도. 전통적 IRA 수탁인이 Roth IRA도 관리하는 경우, 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 금액을 양도하도록 수탁인에게 지시할 수 있습니다.


_**동일 수탁인.**_
새로운 계정을 개설하거나 새 계약을 발행하지 않고 전통적 IRA를 Roth IRA로 재지정함으로써 동일 수탁인이 변환을 진행할 수 있습니다. 
**적격 은퇴 연금 플랜을 Roth IRA로 롤오버.**
본인 또는 사망한 배우자의 다음 플랜에서 받은 적격 롤오버 분배금 전액 또는 일부를 Roth IRA에 롤오버할 수 있습니다.
  * 고용주의 적격 은퇴 연금, 이익 공유 또는 주식 보너스 플랜,
  * 연금 플랜,
  * 세금 감면 연금 플랜 (섹션 403 (b) 플랜), 또는
  * 정부의 이연 보상 플랜 (섹션 457 플랜).


롤오버한 금액에는 전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 변환할 때와 같은 규정이 적용됩니다. 또한 롤오버 기여는 특정 은퇴 연금 플랜 유형에 적용되는 롤오버 요건에 부합해야 합니다.
_**소득.**_
소득에 포함되어야 하는 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜 분배금을 Roth IRA로 변환하지 않은 경우 총소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 납부 시 과세 대상이었던 기초 원가 (세후 기여)의 반환에 해당하는 분배금은 총소득에 포함시키지 마십시오. 이러한 금액은 일반적으로 적격 고용주 플랜을 Roth IRA로 롤오버한 연도의 신고서에 소득으로 포함됩니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_총소득에 포함시킬 금액이 있는 경우, 원천징수 금액을 높이거나 추정세를 지불해야 합니다. 간행물 505, ‘세금 원천징수 및 추정세’를 참조하십시오._.
자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A의 2장, _고용주 플랜에서 Roth IRA로 롤오버_ 를 참조하십시오.
**SIMPLE IRA에서 변환.**
일반적으로 앞서 _전통적 IRA_ 의 [_전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 변환_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172728 "전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 변환")에서 설명한 것과 동일한 규정에 따라 SIMPLE IRA 플랜에서 Roth IRA로 금액을 변환할 수 있습니다.
하지만 고용주가 관리하는 SIMPLE IRA 플랜에 처음 참여한 날짜부터 2년 동안 SIMPLE IRA 플랜에서 인출한 금액은 변환할 수 없습니다. 
**추가 정보.**
변환에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A의 2장에 있는 _Roth IRA로의 금액 이동 가능 여부_ 를 참조하십시오.

60일 이내에 다른 Roth IRA로 변환하는 경우 Roth IRA의 자산 전체 또는 일부를 세금 없이 인출할 수 있습니다. 앞서 _전통적 IRA_ 의 [_IRA 간 롤오버_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172708 "다른 IRA로 롤오버")에서 설명한 롤오버 규정이 대부분 이러한 롤오버 사례에 적용됩니다.
**지정한 Roth IRA 계좌에서 롤오버.**
지정한 Roth 계좌에서는 지정된 다른 Roth 계좌 또는 Roth IRA로만 롤오버할 수 있습니다. 지정된 Roth 계좌에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 575에 나와있는 _지정한 Roth 계좌_ 에서 _롤오버_ 를 참조하십시오.
#### 분배금의 과세 대상 여부
적격 분배금 또는 Roth IRA에서 정규 기여 금액을 반환한 분배금을 귀하의 총소득에 포함시키지 마십시오. 세금 없이 다른 Roth IRA로 롤오버한 Roth IRA 분배금도 포함시키지 마십시오. 다른 분배금의 일부를 소득에 포함시켜야 할 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_분배금 순서 결정 규칙_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172870 "분배금 순서 결정 규칙.")을 참조하십시오.
**적격 분배금 정의**
적격 분배금은 Roth IRA 지불액 또는 분배금 중 다음 요건에 부합하는 것을 의미합니다. 
  1. 급여를 위해 설정한 Roth IRA에 처음 기여한 과세 연도부터 시작하는 5년 기간이 지난 이후에 인출한 경우.
  2. 지불액 또는 분배금이 다음에 해당하는 경우. 
    1. 만 59세가 되는 날짜 이후에 인출½,
    2. 장애로 인한 인출,
    3. 사망 이후 수혜자 또는 상속 재산에 인출, 또는
    4. 특정 적격 첫 주택 구입자를 위한 금액인 최대 $10,000 (평생 한도) 지불. 간행물 590-B의 1장, _과징금 또는 추가 세금이 발생하는 행위에서 첫 주택_ 에 대한 자세한 정보를 참조하십시오.


**5년 기간 이내에 진행한 변환 및 특정 롤오버 기여에 부과되는 추가 세금.**
전통적 IRA에서 Roth IRA로 금액을 변환하거나 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜에서 금액을 롤오버한 과세 연도의 첫 날부터 시작하는 5년 기간 이내에 Roth IRA에서 분배금을 받은 경우, 조기 분배금에 대한 10% 추가 세금을 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 변환 또는 롤오버에 해당하는 금액 중 소득에 포함되어야 할 금액 (변환 또는 롤오버 기여)에 10% 추가 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 각 변환 및 롤오버에 별도의 5년 기간이 적용됩니다. 변환 또는 롤오버 기여에 해당하는 분배금 중 소득에 포함해야 하는 금액이 있다면 뒤에 소개되는 [_분배금 순서 결정 규칙_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000172870 "분배금 순서 결정 규칙.")을 확인하여 금액을 계산하십시오.
**기타 조기 분배금에 부과되는 추가 세금.**
예외가 적용되지 않는 한, 과세 대상 분배금 중 적격 분배금에 해당하지 않는 금액에 10% 추가 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B를 참조하십시오. 
**분배금 순서 결정 규칙.**
수령한 Roth IRA 분배금 중 적격 분배금이 아닌 금액이 있다면 그 중 일부가 과세 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 적격 은퇴 연금 플랜의 변환 기여 및 롤오버 기여 등의 기여와 소득을 Roth IRA에서 인출해야 한다고 간주되는 정해진 순서가 있습니다. 정규 기여가 먼저 인출됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-B 2장, _분배금 과세 대상 여부_ 에서 _분배금 순서 결정 규칙_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**Roth IRA 자산 의무 인출 또는 사용 여부**
Roth IRA에는 필수 인출 나이가 적용되지 않습니다. 전통적 IRA에 적용되는 최저 분배금 규정은 소유자가 생존한 기간에는 Roth IRA에 적용되지 않습니다. 하지만 Roth IRA 소유자 사망 이후에는 전통적 IRA에 적용되는 특정 최저 분배금 규정이 Roth IRA에도 적용됩니다. 
**추가 정보.**
Roth IRA에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 590-A 및 간행물 590-B의 2장을 참조하십시오.
# 파트 셋 - 표준 공제, 항목별 공제 및 기타 공제
조정된 총 소득을 산정한 이후에는 과세대상 소득을 계산하기 위한 공제를 제할 수 있습니다. 표준 공제나 항목별 공제 및 자격을 갖춘 경우 적격 사업 소득 공제를 제할 수 있습니다. 항목별 공제는 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에 열거된 특정 비용 공제입니다. 이 파트 내 세 개 장은 표준 공제와 특정 항목별 공제에 대해 논합니다. 표준 공제와 항목별 공제 중 하나를 결정할 때 고려할 요인에 대해서는 [10장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173000 "표준 공제")을 참조하십시오.
이 장에서 다루는 양식 1040 및 1040-SR 스케줄은 다음과 같습니다.
  * 스케줄 1, 추가 소득 및 소득 조정 사항;
  * 스케줄 2, 파트 II, 기타 세금 및
  * 스케줄 3, 파트 I, 환급 불가 세액공제.


## 10. 표준 공제
## 새로운 소식
**표준 공제 상향.** 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않은 납세자에 대한 표준 공제 금액이 상향되었습니다. 표준 공제 금액은 귀하의 납세자 구분 또는 여러 요소에 따라 달라집니다. 이 장의 끝부분에 있는 [2024년 표준 공제표](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283781 "2024년 표준 공제표")를 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산할 수 있습니다.
#### 소개
이 장에서는 다음과 같은 주제를 다룹니다.
  * 표준 공제 금액 계산 방법.
  * 부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제.
  * 항목별 공제 대상.


대부분의 납세자는 표준 공제나 항목별 공제를 선택할 수 있습니다. 선택권이 있다면 세금을 더 적게 내는 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다.
표준 공제는 과세 대상 수입에서 특정 금액을 제하는 것입니다. 많은 납세자가 의료 비용, 자선 기부금 및 세금 등의 실제 공제를 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에 항목별로 적용할 필요가 없다는 것이 장점입니다. 다음 납세자의 경우 더 높은 표준 공제 금액이 적용됩니다.
  * 만 65세 이상 또는
  * 시각 장애인.


.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_표준 공제 금액이 허용 가능한 항목별 공제 총액보다 높은 경우 표준 공제가 유리합니다._.
**표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 납세자.**
다음과 같은 경우 표준 공제 금액은 없으며, 항목별 공제를 적용해야 합니다. 
  * 귀하의 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 신고이고, 배우자가 신고서에서 항목별 공제를 적용한 경우, 
  * 연차 회계기간 변경으로 인해 짧은 과세 연도에 대한 세금 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 또는 
  * 해당 연도 중 비거주 또는 이중 신분 외국인인 경우. 해당 연도 중 비거주 및 거주 외국인 신분에 모두 해당했던 경우 귀하는 이중 신분 체류자입니다. 


해당 연도 말에 귀하가 미국 시민권자 또는 거주 외국인과 결혼한 비거주 외국인인 경우, 미국 거주자로 간주되도록 선택할 수 있습니다. (간행물 519를 참고하십시오.) 이렇게 선택한 경우 표준 공제를 받을 수 있습니다.

#### 표준 공제 금액
만 65세 이상 또는 시각 장애인 여부 및 다른 납세자의 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 있는지와 관계 없이 표준 공제 금액은 귀하의 납세자 구분에 따라 달라집니다. 일반적으로 표준 공제 금액은 매년 물가 상승률을 고려하여 조정됩니다. 납세자 대부분의 표준 공제 금액은 [표 10-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283782 "표 10-1.대부분의 납세자에게 해당하는 표준 공제표*")에 표시되어 있습니다.
**사망자의 최종 신고서.**
사망자의 최종 세금 신고서에 대한 표준 공제는 해당 납세자가 생존했을 경우와 동일한 공제 금액이 적용됩니다. 하지만 사망 시 나이가 만 65세 이상인 경우, 나이에 대한 고액 표준 공제는 청구할 수 없습니다. 
#### 나이 (만 65세 이상)에 적용되는 고액 표준 공제
해당 연도 마지막 날 기준으로 나이가 만 65세 이상이고 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않는 경우, 고액 표준 공제 신청 자격이 없습니다. 65번째 생일 전날부터 만 65세로 간주됩니다. 그러므로 1960년 1월 2일 전에 출생한 경우 2024년에 고액 표준 공제를 받을 수 있습니다.
[표 10-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283783 "표 10-2.1960년 1월 2일 이전 출생자 또는 시각 장애인을 위한 표준 공제표*")를 사용하여 표준 공제 금액을 계산하십시오.
**납세자 사망.**
2024년에 사망한 납세자의 신고서를 작성하는 경우 [표 10-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283783 "표 10-2.1960년 1월 2일 이전 출생자 또는 시각 장애인을 위한 표준 공제표*") 또는 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")를 사용하기전에 다음 문장을 읽으십시오. 납세자가 사망 시 만으로 65살이 넘었어야지만 해당 납세자가 2024년말에 65세 이상였던 것으로 간주됩니다. 납세자의 생년원일이 1960년 1월 2일 이더라도 사망 시 만으로 65살이 넘지 않았다면 2024년말에 65세 이상였던 것으로 간주되지 않습니다.
65 번째 생일 전날부터 65세가 된것으로 간주됩니다.
#### 시각 장애인에 대한 고액 표준 공제
해당 연도 마지막 날을 기준으로 시각 장애인으로서 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않는 경우, 고액 표준 공제 신청 자격이 없습니다.
**완전 실명이 아닌 경우.**
완전 실명이 아닌 경우, 안과 의사 (안과 전문의 또는 검안사)에게서 다음 내용에 대한 증명서를 받아야 합니다. 
  * 안경이나 콘택트 렌즈를 착용하고도 시력이 20/200 이하이거나
  * 가시 범위가 20도 이하. 


이러한 한도 이상으로 시력 상태가 개선되지 않을 것으로 예상되면 증명서에 이 사실을 포함시켜야 합니다. 이 증명서를 증빙서류로 보관하십시오. 
콘택트 렌즈 착용으로만 이러한 한도 이상으로 시력이 교정되지만 통증, 감염 또는 궤양 때문에 오래 착용할 수 없는 경우, 다른 방법으로 자격을 갖춘다면 시각 장애인에 대한 고액 표준 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 
#### 만 65세 이상 또는 시각 장애인 배우자
배우자가 만 65세 이상이거나 시각 장애인이며 다음에 해당될 경우 고액 표준 공제를 받을 수 있습니다.
  * 공동 신고서를 제출하거나
  * 개별 신고서를 제출하면서 배우자의 총소득이 없으며 다른 납세자의 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 없는 경우.


**배우자 사망.**
배우자가 2024년에 만 65세가 되기 전 사망한 경우 배우자로 인해 고액 표준 공제를 받을 수 없습니다. 배우자가 1960년 1월 2일 이전에 출생했더라도 2024년에 사망 시 나이가 만 65세 이상이 아니라면 해당 나이로 간주되지 않습니다. 
65번째 생일 전날 만 65세가 된 것으로 간주됩니다.
**예시.**
귀하의 배우자가 1959년 2월 14일에 출생하여 2024년 2월 13일에 사망했습니다. 귀하의 배우자는 사망 시 만 65세로 간주됩니다. 하지만 배우자가 2024년 2월 12일에 사망한 경우 사망 시 만 65세가 된 것으로 간주되지 않으며 2024년 말에 65세 이상이 아닙니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하는 본인과 배우자 외 다른 사람에 대한 고액 표준 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다._.
#### 재난 순 손실에 대한 고액 표준 공제
표준 공제 금액은 적격 재난 순 손실에 따라 상향될 수 있습니다.
양식 1040의 지침 및 스케줄 A (양식 1040)의 지침을 통해 표준 공제 금액 상향을 계산하여 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 신고하는 방법에 관한 자세한 정보를 확인하십시오.
#### 예시
다음 예시는 [표 10-1 및 10-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283782 "표 10-1.대부분의 납세자에게 해당하는 표준 공제표*")를 사용하여 표준 공제를 구하는 방법을 묘사합니다.
**예시 1.**
만 46세 와 만 33세인 부부는 2024년에 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 두 명 모두 시각 장애인이 아니며, 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 없습니다. 이들은 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않기로 결정합니다. 이들은 [표 10-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283782 "표 10-1.대부분의 납세자에게 해당하는 표준 공제표*")을 사용합니다. 표준 공제 금액은 $29,200입니다.
**예시 2.**
2024년 말 배우자중 한명이 시각 장애인이 되었다는 점을 빼면 나머지 사실은 _예시 1_ 과 같습니다. 이들은 [표 10-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283783 "표 10-2.1960년 1월 2일 이전 출생자 또는 시각 장애인을 위한 표준 공제표*")를 사용합니다. 표준 공제 금액은 $30,750입니다.
**예시 3.**
부부는 2024년에 공동 신고서를 제출합니다. 두 명 모두 만 65세 이상입니다. 두 명 모두 시각 장애인이 아니며, 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 없습니다. 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않는다면, 이들은 [표 10-2](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283783 "표 10-2.1960년 1월 2일 이전 출생자 또는 시각 장애인을 위한 표준 공제표*")를 사용합니다. 표준 공제 금액은 $32,300입니다.
#### 부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제
다른 사람의 세금 신고서에서 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 개인에 대한 표준 공제는 일반적으로 다음 중 더 큰 금액으로 제한됩니다.
  * $1,300, 또는
  * 해당 연도에 발생한 개인 근로 소득에 $450을 합산한 금액 (하지만 일반적으로 $14,600인 일반 표준 공제 금액을 초과하지 않음).


그러나 만 65세 이상이거나 시각 장애인인 경우 표준 공제 금액이 높아질 수 있습니다.
귀하 (또는 공동 신고의 경우 배우자)가 다른 사람의 신고서에 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 있는 경우 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")을 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산하십시오.
**근로 소득 정의.**
근로 소득은 급여, 임금, 팁, 전문 수수료 및 기타 실제 업무를 수행하고 받은 금액을 의미합니다. 
표준 공제의 목적에서 근로 소득에는 과세 대상 장학금 또는 연구비 보조금도 포함됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 970에서 장학금 및 연구비에서 장학금 또는 연구비 보조금 자격에 해당하는 내용을 참조하십시오. 
**예시 1.**
귀하는 만 16세이며, 미혼입니다. 귀하의 부모님은 2024년 세금 신고서에서 귀하를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 $780의 이자 소득이 있으며 임금은 $150입니다. 귀하에게는 항목별 공제가 없으며 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")을 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산합니다. 귀하는 라인 1에 $150 (근로 소득), 라인 13에 $600 ($150 + $450), 라인 5에 $1,300 ($550과 $1,300 중 더 큰 금액), 라인 6에 $14,600를 입력합니다. 라인 7a의 표준 공제는 $1,300 ($1,300와 $14,600 중 더 작은 금액)입니다.
**예시 2.**
귀하는 만 22세 대학생이며 귀하의 부모의 2024년 세금신고서에서 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 있습니다. 귀하는 기혼이며 부부 개별 신고서를 제출합니다. 귀하의 배우자는 개별 신고서에 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않습니다. 귀하는 $1,500의 이자 소득이 있고, 임금은 $3,800이며 항목별 공제는 없습니다. 귀하는 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")을 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산합니다. 라인 1에 근로 소득 $3,800을 입력합니다. 라인 1과 라인 2 금액을 합산하고 라인 3에 $4,250 ($3,800 + $450)를 입력합니다. 라인 5에 라인 3과 라인 4 중 더 큰 금액인 $4,250를 입력합니다. 귀하는 기혼자이며 부부 개별 신고를 하므로, 라인 6에 $14,600를 입력합니다. 라인 6 금액인 $14,600보다 적으므로 라인 7a에 $4,250를 표준 공제로 입력합니다.
**예시 3.**
귀하는 미혼이며 부모의 2024년 세금신고서에 부양 가족으로 청구될 수 있습니다. 귀하는 만 18세이며, 시각 장애인이고 $1,300의 이자 소득이 있으며 임금은 $2,900이고 항목별 공제는 없습니다. 귀하는 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")을 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산합니다. 라인 1에 임금 $2,900를 입력합니다. 라인 1과 라인 2 금액을 합산하고 라인 3에 $3,350 ($2,900 + $450)를 입력합니다. 라인 5에 라인 3과 라인 4 중 더 큰 금액인 $3,350를 입력합니다. 귀하는 미혼이므로, 라인 6에 $14,600를 입력하고 라인 7a에 $3,350를 입력합니다. 라인 5과 라인 6 중 더 적은 금액입니다. 워크시트 상단에 박스에 체크했기 때문에, 라인 7b에 $1,950를 입력합니다. 그 후 라인 7a과 라인 7b 금액을 합산하고 라인 7c에 $5,300 ($3,350 + $1,950)를 표준 공제 금액으로 입력합니다.
**예시 4.**
귀하는 만 18세이며, 미혼이고 귀하의 부모님은 2024년 세금 신고서에서 그를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 $7,000의 임금과 $500의 이자 소득이 있고 사업상의 손실은 $3,000이며 항목별 공제는 없습니다. 귀하는 [표 10-3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000283784 "표 10-3.부양 가족에 대한 표준 공제 워크시트 이 워크시트는 다른 사람이 귀하 \( 공동 신고의 경우 배우자\)를 부양 가족으로 청구할 수 있는 경우에만 사용하십시오.")을 사용하여 표준 공제를 계산합니다. 라인 1에 $4,000 ($7,000 - $3,000)를 입력합니다. 라인 1과 라인 2 금액을 합산하고 라인 3에 $4,450 ($4,000 + $450)를 입력합니다. 라인 5에 라인 3과 라인 4 중 더 큰 금액인 $4,450를 입력합니다. 귀하는 미혼이므로, 라인 6에 $14,600를 입력합니다. 라인 6 금액인 $14,600보다 적으므로 라인 7a에 $4,450를 표준 공제로 입력합니다.
#### 항목별 공제 대상
전체 공제 금액이 표준 공제 금액보다 많은 경우 항목별 공제를 적용해야 합니다. 또한 앞서 [_표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 납세자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173004 "표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 납세자.")에서 소개한대로, 표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 경우 항목별 공제를 적용해야 합니다.
항목별 공제를 먼저 계산한 후 표준 공제와 비교하여 혜택이 더 나은 방법을 사용해야 합니다.
_**항목별 공제 시기.**_
다음에 해당하는 경우 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 항목별 공제의 이점을 누릴 수 있습니다. 
  * 표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않음,
  * 해당 연도 중 보험이 적용되지 않는 의료 및 치과 진료 비용이 많음,
  * 주택 이자 및 세금을 납부함,
  * 보험이 적용되지 않는 손해 또는 절도 손실이 많음, 
  * 유자격 자선 단체 기부액이 많음, 또는
  * 자격 조건에 해당하는 표준 공제 금액을 초과하는 전체 항목별 공제 금액 보유.


이러한 공제는 [11장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173134 "세금")과 이전에 언급된 _유용한 사항들_ 에 언급된 간행물에서 설명되어 있습니다.
항목별 공제 적용을 결정한 경우 스케줄 A (양식 1040)를 작성하여 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 첨부하십시오. 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 17의 금액을 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 12에 입력합니다.
**주 정부 세금 또는 기타 목적으로 항목별 공제 선택.**
항목별 공제가 표준 공제 금액보다 적더라도, 연방 신고서에서 표준 공제보다 항목별 공제를 선택할 수 있습니다. 예컨대 주 정부 세금 신고서에 항목별 공제를 적용하는 세금 혜택이 연방 신고서에서 표준 공제를 받지 않아서 잃는 세금 혜택보다 더 큰 경우에 이러한 선택을 해야 할 것입니다. 이러한 선택을 하려면 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 18의 빈칸에 표시해야 합니다. 
**결정 변경.**
항목별 공제를 적용하지 않고 나중에 이 방법을 다시 적용하고자 하거나 항목별 공제를 적용하고 나중에 이를 취소하고자 하는 경우, 양식 1040-X, ‘수정된 미국 개인 소득세 신고서’를 제출하여 신고서를 변경할 수 있습니다. 1장의 [_수정된 신고서와 환급 청구_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000170688 "수정된 신고서 및 환급 청구")에서 수정된 신고서에 대한 자세한 정보를 확인하십시오.
_**개별 신고서를 제출한 기혼자.**_
본인과 배우자 모두 같은 내용을 적용할 경우에만 공제 방법을 변경할 수 있습니다. 본인과 배우자 모두 변경에 따라 발생할 수 있는 추가 세금 부과에 대한 동의서를 제출해야 합니다. 
귀하와 배우자는 둘 중 한 명이 다른 방법을 적용했을 때보다 더 많은 세금을 부담하더라도 총 세금이 더 낮은 방법을 선택할 수 있습니다. 귀하와 배우자는 모두 동일한 공제 방식을 사용해야 합니다. 둘 중 한 명이 항목별 공제를 적용하는 경우, 나머지 배우자도 표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않으므로 항목별 공제를 적용해야 합니다. 앞서 다룬 [_표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 납세자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173004 "표준 공제 자격에 해당하지 않는 납세자.")를 참조하십시오.

#### 세금을 공제하기 위한 테스트
세금을 공제하려면 아래 두 가지 테스트를 반드시 충족해야 합니다.
  * 세금이 반드시 본인에게 부과될 것.
  * 과세 연도 중 해당 세금을 납부할 것.


**세금은 반드시 본인에게 부과되야 함.**
일반적으로 오직 본인에게 부과된 세금만 공제할 수 있습니다. 
귀하가 재산의 소유자일 경우에만 재산세를 공제할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 배우자가 재산을 소유하고 부동산세를 납부하는 경우, 해당 세금은 배우자의 개별 신고서나 공동 신고서에서 공제 가능합니다. 
**과세 연도 중 해당 세금을 납부할 것.**
귀하께서 현금 기준 납세자라면, 과세 연도 중 실제로 납부한 세금만 공제할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 세금을 수표로 납부하고 금융 기관에서 이를 인정하는 경우, 수표를 우편 또는 인편으로 발송한 날이 납부 날짜입니다. 전화 납부 계정 (신용 카드 또는 전자 자금 인출)을 이용하는 경우, 금융 기관에서 납부 시기를 표시한 증명서에 보고된 날짜가 납부 날짜입니다. 귀하가 체납 세금에 이의를 제기하고 있으며 현금 기준 납세자라면, 실제로 세금을 납부 (또는 이의를 제기한 세금을 납부하기 위해 금전 또는 기타 재산을 양도)한 연도에만 세금을 공제할 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 538을 참조하십시오.
발생주의 회계처리 방법을 사용하는 경우 간행물 538에서 자세한 정보를 확인하십시오.
#### 소득세
이 섹션에서는 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 (주 정부 수당 기금에 대한 직원 기여 포함) 및 해외 소득세의 공제 여부를 설명합니다.
#### 주 및 지방 정부 소득세
주 및 지방 정부 소득세는 공제 가능합니다.
**예외.**
면제 소득이 이자 소득인 경우를 제외하면 연방 소득세에서 면제된 소득에 대한 주 및 지방 정부 소득세를 공제할 수 없습니다. 예를 들어, 연방 소득세에서 면제된 생계 수당에 대한 주 정부 소득세는 공제할 수 없습니다. 
#### 공제 대상
귀하는 다음과 같이 원천징수 세금, 추정세 납부, 또는 기타 세금 납부에 대한 공제를 할 수 있습니다.
**원천징수 세금.**
급여에서 원천징수 된 주 및 지방 정부 소득세는 원천징수된 연도에 공제를 할 수 있습니다. 양식 W-2에 해당 금액이 표시됩니다. 양식 W-2G, 1099-B, 1099-DIV, 1099-G, 1099-K, 1099-MISC, 1099–NEC, 1099-OID, 1099-R도 원천징수된 주 및 지방 정부 소득세를 표시할 수 있습니다. 
**추정세 납부.**
해당 연도에 주 또는 지방 정부에 납부한 추정세를 공제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 추정세를 납부하는 합리적인 근거가 있어야 합니다. 납부 당시 선의로 납부하지 않은 주 또는 지방 정부 추정세는 공제할 수 없습니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 주 정부 소득세를 추정세로 납부했습니다. 하지만 예상 주 정부 체납 세금 추정치에 따라 납부한 추정세 전액을 환급받을 수 있다는 점을 알게 됩니다. 주 정부 소득세에 추가 세금이 부과되지 않는다고 믿을 합리적인 근거가 없으므로, 추정세 납부를 공제할 수 없습니다.
**세금으로 적용된 환급금.**
전년도 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급액 중 2024년 추정 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세에서 세액공제를 선택한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 
다음 항목만큼 공제를 삭감하지 마십시오. 
  * 2024년에 받을 것으로 예상되는 주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급 (또는 세액공제).
  * 2024년에 실제로 수령한 전년도 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 환급 (또는 세액공제) 금액. 


하지만 이러한 환급 (세액공제) 금액의 일부나 전체가 과세 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 뒤에서 다룰 [_주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급 (또는 세액공제)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173159 "주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급 \(또는 세액공제\).")를 참조하십시오.
**개별 연방 신고서.**
귀하와 배우자가 주, 지방, 연방 소득세 신고서를 개별로 제출하는 경우, 각각 연방 신고서에서 해당 과세 연도 동안 납부한 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 금액만 공제할 수 있습니다. 
_**주 및 지방 정부 공동 신고서.**_
귀하와 배우자가 주 및 지방 정부 신고서를 공동으로 제출하고, 연방 세금 신고서를 별도로 제출하는 경우, 별도 연방 세금 신고서에서 해당 과세 연도 동안 납부한 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 금액만 공제할 수 있습니다. 부부 합산 총소득과 비교해 귀하의 총소득에 비례하는 총 세금 금액만 공제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 해당 연도에 실제 납부한 금액을 초과하여 공제할 수 없습니다. 귀하와 배우자가 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 전액을 공동 및 개별적으로 납부할 책임이 있는 경우 이러한 계산을 피할 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우 귀하와 배우자는 부부 별도 연방 세금 신고서에서 각각 실제로 납부한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 
**공동 연방 신고서.**
공동 연방 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 부부가 납부한 주 및 지방 정부 소득세를 공제할 수 있습니다. 
**주 정부 수당 기금 기여.**
직원으로서 급여 손실을 보호하기 위해 귀하의 급여에서 원천징수하는 주 정부 수당 기금에 대한 의무 기여를 공제할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 특정 주에서는 직원이 장애 또는 실업 보험 수당을 제공하는 주 정부 기금에 기여해야 합니다. 아래 주 수당 기금에 대한 의무 납부액은 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5a에서 주 정부 소득세로 공제 가능합니다. 
  * 알라스카 실업 수당 기금.

  * 뉴저지 업무 외 요인에 의한 장애 급여 기금.
  * 뉴저지 실업 수당 기금.

.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_민간 또는 자발적 장애 계획에 직원이 기여한 금액은 공제할 수 없습니다._.
**주 또는 지방 정부 소득세 환급 (또는 세액공제).**
주 또는 지방 정부 소득세를 납부한 다음 해에 환급 (또는 세액공제)을 받은 경우, 해당 환급 금액을 수령한 연도의 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 1에 소득으로 포함시켜야 합니다. 여기에는 과다 원천징수되었거나 전년도 신고서에서 신청하지 않았거나, 정확히 계산하지 않았거나 수정된 신고서에 따라 다시 계산한 세금 환급이 포함됩니다. 전년도에 항목별 공제를 적용하지 않았다면 환급 금액을 소득에 포함시키지 마십시오. 전년도에 세금을 공제한 경우, 환급 받는 연도의 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 1에 환급 금액의 전체 또는 일부를 포함시키십시오. 포함할 금액에 관한 설명은 간행물 525, ‘과세 대상 및 비과세 대상 소득’에서 _회수_ 를 참조하십시오. 
#### 해외 소득세
일반적으로 외국 또는 미국 영토에서 부과한 소득세에 대해 공제 또는 세액공제를 신청할 수 있습니다. 하지만 납부한 해외 소득 중 해외 근로 소득 제외 또는 해외 주택 제외에 따라 미국 세금에서 면제된 금액에는 공제나 세액공제를 신청할 수 없습니다. 제외에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 54, ‘해외에 있는 미국 시민권자 및 거주 외국인을 위한 세금 안내’를 참조하십시오. 해외 세액공제에 대한 정보는 간행물 514를 참조하십시오.
#### 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세
스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5a의 항목별 공제로서 주 및 지방 정부 소득세 대신 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세를 공제하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 실제 비용 또는 주 및 지방 정부 판매세표를 사용하여 판매세 공제를 계산할 수 있습니다.
**실제 비용.**
일반적으로 일반 판매세율과 동일하게 적용된 경우 실제 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세 (보상 사용세 포함)를 공제할 수 있습니다.
_**식품, 의류 및 의료용품.**_
식품, 의류 및 의료용품 판매세는 세율이 일반 판매세율보다 낮았더라도 일반 판매세로서 공제 가능합니다.
_**차량.**_
차량 판매세는 세율이 일반 판매세율보다 낮았더라도 일반 판매세로서 공제 가능합니다. 하지만 일반 판매세보다 높은 비율로 차량에 판매세를 납부한 경우, 일반 판매세율을 적용했을 때 납부했을 세금만큼만 공제 가능합니다. 임대 차량에 납부한 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세를 포함시키십시오. 이 섹션에서 논의하는 목적에 따라 차량에는 자동차, 오토바이, 이동 주택, 레저 자동차, SUV, 트럭, 밴 및 오프로드 자동차가 포함됩니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_실제 비용 방식을 사용하는 경우 납부한 일반 판매세 영수증을 보관해야 합니다._.
_**사업 또는 비즈니스 항목.**_
귀하의 사업 또는 비즈니스에 사용한 항목에 납부한 판매세는 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에 포함시키지 마십시오. 대신 사업 소득 및 비용을 신고하기 위해 사용하는 양식 지침에서 이러한 세금의 공제 가능 여부를 확인하십시오.
**선택적 판매세표.**
실제 비용을 사용하는 대신 스케줄 A (양식 1040) 지침의 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세표를 사용하여 귀하의 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세 공제를 계산할 수 있습니다. 또한 특정 항목에 납부한 주 및 지방 정부 일반 판매세를 합산할 수도 있습니다. 
표에서 적용 가능한 금액은 거주지와 소득 및 가족 규모를 기준으로 합니다. 귀하의 소득은 총조정소득과 다음과 같은 비과세 항목을 합산한 금액입니다.
  * 비과세 이자.
  * 재향군인 혜택.
  * 비과세 전투 수당.
  * 근로자 보수.

같은 과세 연도 동안 여러 주에 거주한 경우, 각 주에 생활한 날짜를 기준으로 주마다 적용 가능한 표 금액을 비율적으로 계산해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5a 지침을 참조하십시오.
#### 주 또는 지방 정부 부동산세
공제 가능 부동산세는 일반적인 대중 복지를 위해 부동산에 부과되는 주 및 지방세를 의미합니다. 이러한 세금은 세무 당국 관할에 위치한 모든 재산에 동일하게 평가된 경우에만 이러한 세금을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이러한 수익금은 귀하에게 제공된 특별 권한 또는 서비스에 대한 지불액이 아닌 일반 공동체 또는 정부 목적으로 납부되어야 합니다.
공제 가능 부동산세에는 일반적으로 지방 혜택 및 재산 가치를 높이는 투자를 위해 부과된 세금이 포함되지 않습니다. 또한 세무 당국에 납부된 부과금이더라도 특정 재산이나 사람에게 부과된 항목별 서비스 요금 (쓰레기 수거 등)은 포함시킬 수 없습니다. 공제 불가능한 세금과 요금에 관한 자세한 정보는 뒤에서 다룰 [_부동산 관련 공제불가 항목_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173196 "공제불가 부동산 관련 항목")을 참조하십시오.
**주택 협동 조합 법인의 임차인-주주.**
일반적으로 협동 조합 주택 법인의 임차인-주주인 경우 법인에 납부한 금액 중 해당 법인이 납부했거나 귀하의 주거 단위에 발생한 부동산세 지분을 나타내는 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 해당 법인은 귀하의 세금 지분을 표시하는 증명서를 제공해야 합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 530의 _협동 조합에 대한 특별 규정_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**매수인과 매도인의 부동산세 분배.**
해당 연도 중 부동산을 매수 또는 매도했다면 매수인과 매도인이 부동산세를 분배해야 합니다. 
매도인과 매수인은 부동산세 과세 연도 (부과된 세금과 관계된 기간) 중 각자가 재산을 소유한 일수에 따라 부동산세를 분배해야 합니다. 매도인은 매매일 전날까지 세금을 내는 것으로 간주합니다. 매수인은 매매일부터 세금을 내는 것으로 간주합니다. 이는 현지법에 따른 과세 기준일과 관계 없이 적용됩니다. 일반적으로 이러한 정보는 매매 종결 시 제공되는 결산서에 포함됩니다. 
귀하 (매도인)가 현금주의 회계처리 방법을 사용하여 세금을 납부할 때까지 공제할 수 없고, 귀하의 재산 매수인이 해당 세금을 개인적으로 납부해야 하는 경우, 매매 시점에 해당 세금 중 귀하의 지분을 납부한 것으로 간주됩니다. 이에 따라 매매 날짜에 세금을 실제로 납부하지 않았더라도 해당 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 재산 매도 가격에 해당 세금 금액을 포함시켜야 합니다. 매수자는 재산 취득 비용에 같은 금액을 포함시켜야 합니다. 
부동산세 과세 연도 중 매수 또는 매도한 각 재산에 부과되는 세금에 대한 공제는 다음과 같이 계산합니다. 
### 워크시트 11-1. 주 또는 지방 정부 부동산세 공제 계산
1.  | 부동산세 과세 연도의 주 및 지방 정부 부동산세 전체 금액을 기입합니다  | _____  
---|---|---  
2.  | 부동산세 과세 연도 중 귀하가 재산을 소유한 일수를 기입합니다  | _____  
3.  | 라인 2의 금액을 365로 나눕니다 (윤년의 경우 라인 2 금액을 366으로 나눕니다) | .  
4.  | 라인 1과 라인 3의 금액을 곱합니다. 귀하의 표준 공제 금액입니다. 이 금액을 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5b에 기입합니다 |   
**참고.** 부동산세 과세 연도 중 매수 또는 매도한 각 재산에 대해 1~4단계를 반복합니다. 모든 재산에 대한 전체 공제 금액은 라인 4 금액의 합입니다.  
_**이전 연도에 대한 부동산세.**_
체납 세금이 재산을 매도하기 전 부동산세 과세 연도에 적용되었다면 매수인과 매도인은 체납 세금을 나누지 않습니다. 매수인이 체납 세금을 납부하는 데 합의하더라도 이를 공제할 수 없습니다. 매수인은 재산 비용에 해당 금액을 추가해야 합니다. 매도인은 매수인이 납부한 체납 세금을 공제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 매도인은 매도 가격에 이를 포함시켜야 합니다. 
_**예시.**_
다음 예시는 매수인과 매도인이 부동산세를 나누는 방법을 설명합니다. 
**예시 1.**
포터와 라일리 와잇 부부의 이전 주택과 신규 주택 모두에 적용되는 부동산세 과세 연도는 일반 연도이며, 납부 기한은 8월 1일입니다. 5월 7일에 매도한 이전 주택에 부과된 세금은 $620였습니다. 5월 3일에 매수한 신규 주택에 부과된 세금은 $732였습니다. 포터와 라일리는 조세 당국에 실제로 세금을 납부하지 않았더라도 이전 주택에 비율로 계산한 부동산세 지분을 납부한 것으로 간주됩니다. 반면 이들이 신규 재산에 부과된 세금을 모두 납부했더라도 비율에 따라 납부한 세금 지분만 청구할 수 있습니다. 
포터와 라일리는 해당 부동산세 과세 연도 중 127일 동안 이전 주택을 소유했습니다 (1월 1일부터 매매 전날인 5월 6일까지). 이들은 이전 주택에 대한 세금 공제를 다음과 같이 계산합니다. 
**표 . 워크시트 11-1. 주 또는 지방 정부 부동산세 공제 계산 - 이전 주택에 대한 세금**

이전 주택의 매수인들이 세금을 전부 납부했으므로, 포터와 라일리는 이전 주택의 매도 가격에 $215도 포함시킵니다. (매수인들은 주택 가격에 $215를 합산합니다.) 
포터와 라일리는 해당 부동산세 과세 연도 중 243일 동안 신규 주택을 소유했습니다 (매매 날짜를 포함하여 5월 3일부터 12월 31일까지). 이들은 신규 주택에 대한 세금 공제를 다음과 같이 계산합니다.

포터와 라일리는 신규 주택에 부과된 세금을 모두 납부했으므로, 신규 주택 비용에 $246 (납부한 $732에서 $486 공제를 제한 금액)를 합산합니다. (매도인은 $246를 매도 가격에 합산한 후 $246를 부동산세로 공제합니다.) 
포터와 라일리의 이전 및 신규 주택에 대한 부동산세 공제는 $215와 $486의 합인 $701입니다. 이 금액을 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5b에 기입합니다. 
**예시 2.**
리즈와 퀸 브라운 부부는 2024년 5월 3일에 신규 주택을 매입했습니다. 신규 주택에 대한 부동산세 과세 연도는 일반 연도입니다. 해당 주의 2023년에 대한 부동산세는 2024년 1월 1일에 부과되었습니다. 이 세금의 납부 기한은 2024년 5월 31일과 2024년 10월 31일입니다.
이들은 매매 날짜 이후에 납부 기한이 도래하는 모든 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 2023년 부동산세는 $680이었습니다. 이들은 2024년 5월 31일에 $340, 2024년 10월 31일에 $340를 납부했습니다. 이는 2023년 부동산세 과세 연도에 부과된 세금이었습니다. 브라운 부부는 2024년까지 재산을 소유하지 않았으므로 이 금액을 공제할 수 없습니다. 대신 신규 주택 비용에 $680를 합산해야 합니다. 
2025년 1월 브라운 부부는 2025년에 납부할 $752에 대한 2024년 재산세 내역서를 받습니다. 브라운 부부는 2024년 부동산세 과세 연도 중 243일 동안 신규 주택을 소유했습니다 (5월 3일부터 12월 31일까지). 이들은 다음과 같이 2025년 세금 공제를 계산할 것입니다. 
**표 . 워크시트 11-1. 주 또는 지방 정부 부동산세 공제 계산 - 신규 주택에 대한 세금**
1.  | 부동산세 과세 연도의 주 및 지방 정부 부동산세 전체 금액을 기입합니다  | _$752_  
---|---|---  
2.  | 부동산세 과세 연도 중 귀하가 재산을 소유한 일수를 기입합니다  | _243_  
3.  | 라인 2의 금액을 365로 나눕니다 (윤년의 경우 라인 2 금액을 366으로 나눕니다) | _0.6639_  
4.  | 라인 1과 라인 3의 금액을 곱합니다. 귀하의 표준 공제 금액입니다. 이 금액을 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 5b에 청구합니다 | $499  
2024년에 납부한 $680과 함께 2025년에 납부한 나머지 세금 $251 ($752에서 $501 공제 금액을 제한 금액)가 신규 주택 비용에 합산됩니다. 
매매 날짜까지 부과된 세금을 매매 날짜에 매도인이 납부한 것으로 간주되기 때문에 매도인은 $933에 대한 2024년 세금 공제를 받을 자격이 있습니다. 이는 2023년에 부과된 $680와 2024년에 매도인이 주택을 소유한 123일에 부과된 $253의 합입니다. 매도인은 매매 이득 또는 손실을 계산할 때 매도 가격에 $933을 포함해야 합니다. 매도인은 2025년 1월 브라운 부부에게 연락하여 2024년 부동산세 금액을 파악해야 합니다. 
_**양식 1099-S.**_
부동산의 특정 판매 또는 교환의 경우, 판매를 종결할 책임이 있는 사람 (일반적으로 부동산 거래 중개인)이 양식 1099-S, 부동산 거래 수익금을 작성하여 IRS와 재산 매도인에게 특정 정보를 신고합니다. 양식 1099-S의 박스 2는 매매 총 수익금을 작성하기 위한 것이며 매수인이 매매 날짜 이후에 납부해야 하는 매도인의 부동산 체납 세금액이 포함되어야 합니다. 매수인은 이러한 세금을 재산 취득 원가에 포함시키고, 매도인은 이 금액을 납부한 세금으로 공제하며 재산의 매매 가격에도 포함시킵니다. 
주택과 관련된 부동산 거래의 경우 매도인이 미리 납부하였지만 매수인의 세금에 포함된 부동산세가 양식 1099-S의 박스 6에 표시됩니다. 매수인은 이 금액을 부동산세로 공제하고, 매도인은 같은 금액을 부동산세 공제로 삭감합니다 (또는 소득에 포함시킵니다). 뒤에서 다룰 [_환급 (또는 리베이트)_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173185 "환급 \(또는 리베이트\).")을 참조하십시오. 
**제 삼자 기탁 기금에 예치된 세금.**
월별 융자금 납부금에 부동산세를 위해 제 삼자 기탁 기금 예치 금액 (제 삼자가 관리하도록 예치된 금액)이 포함된 경우, 해당 기금에 예치된 전체 금액을 공제할 수 없을 것입니다. 제 삼자가 조세 당국에 실제로 납부한 부동산세만 공제할 수 있습니다. 제 삼자가 귀하에게 납부된 부동산세 금액을 통지하지 않은 경우, 해당 제 삼자나 조세 당국에 문의하여 신고서에 표시할 정확한 금액을 파악하십시오. 
**전체 공동 소유자.**
귀하와 배우자가 전체 공동 소유자로 재산을 보유하고 부부 별도 연방 세금 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 부부가 각각 재산에 납부한 세금만 공제할 수 있습니다. 
**이혼한 납세자.**
이혼 또는 별거 합의서에 귀하 및 배우자가 소유한 주택에 부과되는 부동산세를 반드시 납부해야 한다고 명시된 경우, 지불액의 일부는 위자료로 공제 가능하며 나머지는 부동산세로 공제 가능합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 504에 있는 _제 삼자에게 지급한 금액_ 을 참조하십시오. 
**목회자 및 군인 주택 수당.**
귀하가 목회자 또는 제복 복무자로서 소득에서 제외할 수 있는 주택 수당을 받는 경우, 주택에 납부한 부동산세 전액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 
**환급 (또는 리베이트).**
2024년에 납부한 부동산세에 대한 환급 또는 리베이트를 같은 해야 받은 경우 환급된 금액만큼 공제 금액을 삭감해야 합니다. 이전 연도에 공제한 부동산세의 환급 또는 리베이트를 2024년에 받은 경우 일반적으로 환급 또는 리베이트를 수령한 해의 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 하지만 소득에 포함할 금액은 이전 연도의 세금에서 공제한 금액으로 제한됩니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 525에 있는 _회수_ 를 참조하십시오.

**지방 혜택을 위한 세금.**
공제 가능한 부동산세에는 일반적으로 지방 혜택 및 재산 가치를 높이는 개선을 위해 부과된 세금은 포함되지 않습니다. 여기에는 도로, 인도, 급수관, 하수관, 공영 주차 시설, 유사한 개선에 부과되는 세금이 포함됩니다. 귀하는 부과된 금액만큼 재산 취득원가를 상향해야 합니다. 
지방 혜택 세금은 이러한 혜택과 관련한 유지, 보수 또는 이권에 대한 요금인 경우에만 공제 가능합니다. 세금이 유지, 보수 또는 이권을 위해서만 부과된 경우, 공제를 신청하기 위해 해당 금액을 표시할 수 있어야 합니다. 유지, 보수, 또는 이권에 대한 세금 금액을 계산할 수 없는 경우, 세금을 공제할 수 없습니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_지방 혜택을 위한 세금은 귀하의 부동산세 청구서에 포함될 수 있습니다. 조세 당국 (또는 융자 대금업자)가 부동산세 청구서 사본을 제공하지 않는 경우, 이를 요청하십시오. 위의 규정을 사용하여 지방 혜택 세금이 공제 가능한지 결정해야 합니다. 부동산세 청구서의 특정 요금에 대한 추가 정보가 필요한 경우 조세 당국에 문의하십시오._.

.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_위에서 열거한 금액 등 공제 불가능한 항목별 요금이 청구서에 포함되는지 결정하려면 부동산세 청구서를 살펴봐야 합니다. 조세 당국 (또는 융자 대금업자)가 부동산세 청구서 사본을 제공하지 않는 경우, 이를 요청하십시오._.
_**예외.**_
서비스를 유지하거나 개선하기 위해 사용한 서비스 요금 (쓰레기 수거 또는 경찰 또는 소방 등)은 다음과 같은 경우 부동산세로 공제 가능합니다.

  * 서비스 유지 또는 개선을 위해 사용된 기금이 징수한 수수료나 요금으로 제한 또는 결정되지 않는 경우.


**양도세 (또는 인지세).**
양도세와 유사한 세금 및 개인 주택 매매 부과금은 공제 불가능합니다. 매도인이 해당 금액을 지불한 경우, 매매 비용이므로 실현된 매매 금액이 삭감됩니다. 매수인이 납부한 경우, 재산 취득 원가에 포함됩니다. 
**고액 부동산세로 인한 임대료 상승.**
부동산세 상승으로 인한 추징세 형태로 집주인이 임대료를 올리는 경우, 상승분을 세금으로 공제할 수 없습니다.
**주택 소유자 협회비.**
이러한 요금은 주 또는 지방 정부가 아닌 주택 소유자 협회에서 부과한 것이므로 공제 불가능합니다. 
#### 개인 재산세
주 또는 지방세로서 다음에 해당하는 경우 개인 재산세는 공제 가능합니다.
  * 개인 재산에 부과됨,
  * 개인 재산 가치를 기준으로 함,

위의 요건에 부합하는 세금은 특권을 행사하기 위한 것이라도 개인 재산에 부과된 것으로 간주할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 가격을 기준으로 한 연간 세금은 등록비로 지칭하고 차량 등록 또는 고속도로 이용 특권을 위한 것이라도 개인 재산세 자격에 해당합니다.
해당 세금의 일부는 가격을, 나머지는 다른 기준을 바탕으로 하는 경우 부분적으로 자격에 해당합니다.
**예시.**
주 정부에서 가격의 1% 연간 자동차 등록세에 100파운드당 50센트를 합산하여 부과합니다. 귀하는 차량 가격 ($1,500)과 무게 (3,400파운드) 기준으로 $32를 납부했습니다. 귀하는 가격을 기준으로 한 $15 (1% × $1,500)를 개인 재산세로 공제할 수 있습니다. 무게를 기준으로 한 나머지 $17 ($0.50 × 34)는 공제 불가능합니다.
#### 공제 불가능한 세금 및 수수료
다수의 연방, 주 및 지방 정부 세금은 앞서 소개한 분류에 해당하지 않으므로 공제 불가능합니다. 연방 소득세와 같은 기타 세금 및 수수료는 세법에서 해당 항목의 공제를 금지하고 있으므로 공제 불가능합니다. [표 11-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173188 "표 11-1. 공제 가능 세금")을 참조하십시오.

  * 상속 재산, 유산, 유증, 상속 세금. 귀하는 수혜자로서 총소득에 해당 소득을 반드시 포함시켜야 하는 경우 사망자에 대한 소득에 따른 상속세를 공제할 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우 스케줄 A (양식 1040), 라인 16에서 상속세를 공제합니다. 자세한 정보는 간행물 559를 참조하십시오.
  * 연방 소득세. 여기에는 급여에서 원천징수되는 소득세가 포함됩니다.

위에 열거된 것 외 다수의 세금과 수수료도 사업이나 소득 창출 활동에서 통상적이며 필요한 비용에 해당하지 않은 경우 공제 불가능합니다. 기타 공제 불가능한 항목에 대해서는 앞서 다룬 [_공제불가 부동산 관련 항목_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p17ko#en_US_2024_publink1000173196 "공제불가 부동산 관련 항목")을 참조하십시오.

#### 세금 산정
귀하의 소득세는 과세대상 소득을 기준으로 합니다. 소득세와 AMT를 산정한 이후에는 세액공제를 제한 후 귀하가 납부할 다른 세금을 합산합니다. 그 결과가 총 세금입니다. 귀하의 총 세금을 전체 납부액과 비교하여 환급 대상인지 세금을 납부해야 하는지를 산정합니다.
이 섹션에서는 세금 산정 방법에 관한 일반적인 개요를 제시합니다. 양식 1040의 지침에서 단계별 지침을 확인할 수 있습니다.

**입양 자녀.**
입양 자녀는 언제나 귀하의 자녀로 간주됩니다. 입양 자녀에는 법적 입양을 위해 합법적으로 귀하가 맡고 있는 아동도 포함됩니다.
귀하가 미국 시민 또는 국민이며, 2023년 내내 입양 자녀가 귀하의 가족 구성원으로서 함께 지낸 경우, 해당 자녀는 앞서 다룬 자녀 세액공제를 위한 적격 자녀 조건 7 (또는 뒤에서 다룰 ODC 유자격자가 될 수 있는 조건 3)에 부합합니다.

납세자는 IRS의 공식 행동 또는 제안된 행동에 대응하여 이의를 신청하고 추가 문서를 제공하며, IRS가 기한 내에 제기된 이의 및 문서를 신속하고 공정하게 간주할 것으로 기대하며, IRS가 납세자의 입장에 동의하지 않는 경우 답변을 받을 권리가 있습니다.
**5. 독립된 포럼에서 IRS의 결정에 항소를 제기할 권리.**
납세자는 과징금 등 대부분의 IRS 결정에 타당하고 공정한 행정적 이의를 신청하고 IRS 독립 항소국의 결정과 관련하여 서면 답변을 받을 권리가 있습니다. 납세자는 일반적으로 사건을 법원에 제기할 권리가 있습니다.
**6. 종결성에 대한 권리.**

#### 세무 조사 (감사)
IRS는 납세자 대부분의 신고서를 제출한대로 접수합니다. IRS에서 귀하의 신고서에 대해 질의하거나 조사를 위해 선택한 경우 귀하가 부정직하다는 것을 시사하지 않습니다. 이러한 질의나 조사의 결과로 세금이 추가될 수도 그렇지 않을 수도 있습니다. IRS는 변경 없이 귀하의 사건을 종결하거나, 귀하가 환급을 받을 수도 있습니다.
조사를 위해 신고서를 선택하는 과정은 일반적으로 다음 중 한 가지 방법으로 시작됩니다. 첫 번째, IRS는 부정확한 금액이 포함될 가능성이 있는 신고서를 확인하기 위해 컴퓨터 프로그램을 사용합니다. 이러한 프로그램은 양식 1099 및 양식 W-2 등의 정보 신고서, 과거 조사 또는 준수 프로젝트에서 확인한 특정 문제를 바탕으로 할 수 있습니다. 두 번째, IRS는 신고서에 부정확한 금액이 포함될 가능성이 표시된 외부 출처 정보를 이용합니다. 이러한 출처로는 신문, 공공 기록 및 개인이 포함될 수 있습니다. 이러한 정보가 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있다고 판단하는 경우 이를 사용하여 조사를 위한 신고서를 선택할 수 있습니다.
간행물 556, ‘신고서 감사, 항소권, 및 환급 청구’는 IRS가 세무 조사에서 따르는 규칙과 절차를 설명합니다. 다음 섹션은 조사를 진행하는 방식을 간략히 소개합니다.
**우편.**
IRS는 많은 세무 조사와 질의를 우편으로 처리합니다. IRS는 추가 정보 요청 또는 귀하의 신고서를 변경해야 하는 사유를 서신으로 발송합니다. 귀하는 우편으로 응답하거나 조사관과 개인 인터뷰를 요청할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 요청 받은 정보를 우편으로 송부하거나 설명을 제공한 경우, IRS는 귀하의 답변에 동의하거나 그렇지 않을 수 있으며 변경사항이 있는 경우 사유를 설명할 것입니다. 이해할 수 없는 내용이 있다면 주저 없이 우편으로 요청하시기 바랍니다.
**인터뷰.**
IRS가 개인 인터뷰를 통해 조사를 진행한다고 통지하거나 귀하가 그러한 인터뷰를 요청하는 경우, 귀하와 IRS에게 모두 편리한 합리적인 시간과 장소에서 조사를 진행하도록 요청할 권리가 있습니다. 조사관이 귀하의 신고서 변경을 제안하는 경우, 해당 변경의 이유를 설명할 것입니다. 이러한 변경에 동의하지 않는 경우, 조사관의 감독자를 만날 수 있습니다.
**반복 세무 조사.**
IRS에서 지난 2년 간 제출한 신고서에서 같은 항목을 조사하였고 귀하가 납부할 체납 세금에 변경을 제안한 바가 없는 경우, 조사 중단 여부를 확인할 수 있도록 IRS에 최대한 빨리 연락하십시오. 
#### 항소
조사관이 제안한 변경에 동의하지 않는 경우 IRS 독립 항소국에 항소를 요청 할 수 있습니다. 대부분의 의견 차이는 시간과 비용이 드는 법정 소송 없이 해결 가능합니다. 귀하가 항소할 권리는 간행물 5, ‘항소권 및 동의하지 않는 경우 항소하는 방법’과 간행물 556에서 상세하게 설명하고 있습니다.
IRS 독립 항소국의 이용을 원치 않거나 이의 소견에 동의하지 않는 경우, 미국 조세 법원, 연방 청구법원 또는 거주지의 미 연방 지방 법원에 사건을 제기할 수 있습니다. 사건을 법원에 제기한 경우, IRS는 귀하가 적절한 체납 세금을 표시하기 위해 적절한 기록을 보관했는지, IRS에 협조했는지, 다른 특정 조건에 부합하는지 등 특정 사실을 증명할 부담을 지게 됩니다. 법원이 귀하의 사건 중 대부분의 문제에서 귀하에게 동의하고 IRS의 입장이 대부분 정당하지 않다고 판단하는 경우 귀하의 행정 및 소송 비용 중 일부를 회수할 수 있습니다. 이의 항소 시스템 진행 등 사건을 행정적으로 해결하고자 시도하고 사건 해결에 필요한 정보를 제공하지 않은 한 이러한 비용을 회수할 수 없습니다.
#### 징수
간행물 594, ‘IRS 징수 절차’에서는 연방 세금 납부와 관련한 귀하의 권리와 책임을 설명합니다. 해당 간행물은 다음을 설명합니다.
  * 납부할 세금이 있을 경우 취해야 하는 행동. 또한 납세 고지서를 받았는데 잘못되었다고 생각하는 경우 취해야 하는 조치를 설명합니다. 또한 분할 납부, 징수 조치 지연, 세액 조정 제출을 다룹니다.
  * IRS 징수 조치. 선취권, 선취권 해제, 압류, 압류 해제, 차압 및 판매, 재산 해제를 다룹니다.
  * IRS가 국무부에 심각한 체납 세금 부채 증명서를 제출하면 일반적으로 여권 신청이 거부되고 여권 취소로 이어질 수 있습니다.


귀하의 징수 이의신청 권리는 간행물 1660, ‘징수 항소권’에서 자세하게 설명하고 있습니다.
**무고한 배우자 구제.**
일반적으로 귀하와 배우자는 각각 공동 세금 신고서에 표시된 세금과 이자, 과징금 전액을 납부할 책임이 있습니다. 하지만 무고한 배우자에 대한 구제 자격 조건을 갖춘 경우 부부 공동 채무의 일부나 전체를 면제 받을 수 있습니다. 면제를 신청하려면 양식 8857, ‘무고한 배우자에 대한 구제 요청’을 제출해야 합니다. 무고한 배우자에 대한 구제에 관한 자세한 정보는 간행물 971, ‘무고한 배우자에 대한 구제’ 및 양식 8857을 참조하십시오. 
**제삼자와의 연락 가능성.**
일반적으로 IRS는 귀하 및 적법하게 승인된 대리인과 직접 업무를 처리합니다. 하지만 귀하가 제공할 수 없는 정보가 필요하거나 수령한 정보를 검증하기 위해 다른 사람과 논의하기도 합니다. IRS가 이웃, 은행, 고용주, 직원 등 다른 사람과 연락하는 경우, 일반적으로 귀하의 이름 등 제한적인 정보만 알려야 합니다. 법에 따라 IRS는 찾고자 하는 정보를 획득 또는 검증하기 위해 필요한 정보 이상으로 공개할 수 없습니다. 귀하의 사건 관련 활동이 있는 동안 IRS는 지속적으로 다른 사람들에게 연락해야 할 수 있습니다. IRS가 다른 사람과 연락하는 경우, 귀하에게는 연락한 사람의 목록을 요청할 권리가 있습니다. 귀하는 전화나 서면으로, 또는 개인 면담 중에 이러한 요청을 할 수 있습니다.
#### 환급
세금을 초과 납부했다고 생각하는 경우 환급을 청구할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 원본 세금 신고서를 제출일을 기준으로 3년 이내 또는 세금 납부일을 기준으로 2년 이내 중 더 늦게 도래하는 기한 내에 환급을 청구해야 합니다. 법에서는 일반적으로 귀하가 신고서를 제출하거나 환급을 청구한 날짜로부터 45일 이내에 환급 금액이 지급되지 않은 경우, 환급액에 이자를 제공합니다. 간행물 556에서 환급에 대한 자세한 정보를 확인할 수 있습니다.
환급 받을 금액이 있는데 세금 신고서를 제출하지 않은 경우, 일반적으로 반드시 세금 신고서 제출 기한 (기한 연장 포함)으로부터 3년 이내에 세금 신고서를 제출해야 환급을 받을 수 있습니다.
#### 납세자 보호 서비스 (TAS)
TAS는 IRS 내 독립 기관으로서 귀하의 납세자 권리를 보호할 수 있습니다. 귀하에게 곤경을 일으키는 세금 문제가 있거나 IRS와 문제 해결을 시도했지만 성공하지 못한 경우 도움을 제공할 수 있습니다. 귀하가 항상 무료로 제공되는 지원 자격을 갖춘 경우, TAS는 가능한 모든 도움을 제공합니다. [TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov(영어)](http://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov)에 방문하거나 1-877-777-4778 번호로 전화하십시오.

  * IRS는 납세자의 개인 정보 또는 금융 정보를 인증 또는 요청하기 위해 이메일이나, 문자 메세지 (간략한 링크도 포함), 전화 또는 소셜 미디어 채널을 통해 먼저 연락하지 않습니다. 여기에는 개인 식별 번호 (PIN), 비밀 번호 또는 크레딧 카드, 은행 또는 기타 금융 계정 관련 유사 정보도 포함됩니다.
  * [IRS.gov/IdentityTheft](https://www.irs.gov/ko/identity-theft-central)에서 납세자, 세무사와 기업을 위한 신원 도용 및 데이터 보안 보호에 대한 정보를 참고하십시오. SSN을 분실 또는 도난당했거나, 귀하가 세금 관련 신원 도용의 피해자라고 의심되는 경우, 어떤 조치를 취해야 하는지 배울 수 있습니다.

### 비고.
IRS는 최신 암호화 기술을 사용하여 IRS2Go 앱을 이용한 온라인, 전화 또는 모바일 장치를 통한 전자 납부가 안전하게 이루어지도록 합니다. 전자 납부는 수표나 우편환을 우편으로 보내는 것보다 빠르고 간편하며 빠릅니다.
