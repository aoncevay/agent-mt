**年度報稅季計劃（AFSP）和聯邦報稅員名錄。.** 年度報稅季計劃是一項自願投入的計劃，讓不是律師、註冊會計師或註冊報稅代理人的報稅員享有有限的執業權利。國稅局為在特定稅務年度學習特定持續教育時數的納稅申報表報稅員發放年度報稅季計劃結業證書。年度報稅季計劃參與者不具備不受限的執業權利（除非他們同時也是律師、註冊會計師或註冊報稅代理人）。他們的權利僅限於代表他們填寫並屬名的納稅申報表的客戶，並僅能代表客戶與國稅局員工、客服人員，以及類似的國稅局員工往來，這還包含了納稅人辯護服務處 。他們不能代表不是由他們填寫和簽署的納稅申報表的客戶，也不能針對催款或上訴功能代表客戶。請參閱 [IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Annual-Filing-Season-Program （英文）](https://www.irs.gov/zh-hant/tax-professionals/annual-filing-season-program) 以瞭解更多關於年度報稅季計劃的更多資訊。請參閱 [IRS.Treasury.gov/rpo （英文）](https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf) 以存取具備報稅員稅務識別號碼的納稅申報表報稅員的線上可搜尋資料庫，這些報稅員皆具備國稅局認可的專業證照或持有年度報稅季計劃結業證書。

_**拒絕執業。**_

**其他可以擔任代表人士的個人。**
由於他們與納稅人的特殊關係，下列個人在提供令人滿意的身份證明和代表納稅人的授權證明的前提下可以代表指定的納稅人與國稅局往來，除了下列 （1）描述的情況除外。
  1. _**個人。**_ 個人可以代表自己與國稅局往來，並且不需要申報書面的資格和權限聲明。
  2. _**家人。**_ 個人可以代表其直系親屬。直系親屬包括個人的配偶、子女、父母、兄弟或姐妹。
  3. _**官員。**_ 真正的公司（包括母公司、子公司或其他附屬公司）、協會或有組織團體的官員可以代表公司、協會或有組織團體。政府單位、機構或當局的官員在執行公務時可以代表政府單位、機構或當局與國稅局往來。
  4. _**合夥人。**_ 普通合夥人可以代表合夥企業與國稅局往來。
  5. _**員工。**_ 正式的全職員工可以代表他或她的僱主。僱主可以是但不限於個人、合夥企業、公司（包括母公司、子公司或其他附屬公司）、協會、信託、接管、監護、遺產、有組織的團體、政府單位、機構或當局。
  6. _**受託人。**_ 受託人（受託人、執行人、個人代表、管理人、接管人或監護人）站在納稅人的立場上，作為納稅人而非代表人士行事。請參閱後文的 _受託人_ ，該內容列於 [_不需要委託書的情形_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148665 "什麼時候不需要委託書？")下。


#### 代表美國境外的情形
當代表的情形在美國境外發生時，任何個人都可以代表在美國境外的個人或實體與國稅局的人員往來。請參閱 230 號通知的第10.7（c）（1）（vii）條。
#### 特殊出席授權
國稅局局長或委託人可以授權沒有資格在國稅局前執業的個人代表另一位人士處理特定事務。準代表必須以書面形式向專業責任辦公室申請此授權。但是，只有在極其令人信服的情況下才會獲得授權。如果獲得批准，局長或其代表將發出一封信件，詳細說明與獲得授權出席和特定稅務事項相關的條件。
此授權信與國稅局中心發信表明個人被指派了一組集中授權檔案（CAF）號碼不同。簽發一組集中授權檔案（CAF）號碼不代表個人被認可或授權在國稅局前執業。它只是確認已為該編號下的個人建立了一份集中的授權檔案。
**低收入納稅者服務處或學生稅務服務計劃中的學生。**
在低收入納稅者服務處（LITC）或學生稅務服務計劃（STCP）工作的學生必須針對他們是法律、商業或會計系的學生的身份獲得代表納稅人與國稅局往來的許可。授權請求必須發送送至納稅人辯護服務處。如果獲得批准，將發出一封授權學生特殊出席並詳細說明與出席相關的任何條件的信件。收到委託書的學生通常可以在受限於授權信的任何條件下代表納稅人與任何國稅局職能或辦公室往來，並且必須在被授權能在國稅局前執業的個人的直接監督下。如果您打算讓學生代表您，請審查授權信，如果您對授權條款有任何疑問，請諮詢您的學生、您學生的主管或納稅人辯護服務處。

譴責指的是公開譴責。受 230 號通知的個人包含從事代表納稅人或提供建議的活動的任何律師、註冊會計師、註冊報稅代理人、註冊退休計劃規劃師或註冊精算師，以及任何代表納稅人且持有年度報稅季計劃結業證書的人士，以及任何出於聯邦稅務目的從事資產價值估價的估價師。
#### 授權一位代表人士
您可以代表自己，也可以授權個人代表您與國稅局往來。如果您選擇讓他人代表您，您的代表人士必須有資格在國稅局前執業。請參閱前文的 [_誰能在國稅局前執業_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148595 "誰能在國稅局前執業？")內容。
#### 委託書是什麼？
委託書是您對個人從國稅局接收您的機密稅務資訊並代表您執行特定行動的書面授權。如果授權不受限制，個人通常可以執行您可以執行的所有行為，但協商或為支票背書除外。授予註冊退休計劃規劃師、註冊精算師和持有結業證書的未註冊的納稅申報表報稅員的權力是有限的。有關年度申報季計劃結業證書持有人的限制的資訊，請參閱國稅局 2014-42 程序以及 [IRS.gov/Tax-Professionals/Return-Preparer-Office-RPO-At-a-Glance （英文）](https://www.irs.gov/zh-hant/tax-professionals/return-preparer-office-rpo-at-a-glance)。
**採取的行為。**

  1. 代表您與國稅局的任何辦公室或員工往來。
  2. 針對欠稅評估或催款簽署要約或限制豁免協議，或抵免額或退稅申領拒絕豁免通知。
  3. 簽署同意書以延長徵收或追討稅款的法定期限。
  4. 簽署交割協議。


**簽署您的納稅申報表。**
委託書中指定的代表人士不得簽屬您的所得稅表，除非：
  1. 簽署在國稅法規和相關規定下是被允許的（請參閱 條例第 1.6012-1（a）（5） 條），以及
  2. 您具體在您的委託書中授權該內容。


例如，如果您由於下列原因無法簽署納稅申報表，則該法規允許代表人士簽署您的納稅申報表：
  * 疾病或受傷。
  * 在法律規定申報納稅申報表的日期前連續離開美國（包括波多黎各）至少 60 天。
  * 如果向國稅局申請特定許可並獲批准的其他正當理由。


當申報表由代表人士簽署時，必須附有授權代表簽署納稅申報表的委託書（或副本）。如需瞭解更多資訊，請參閱 《表格 2848》的說明。
**替代或委託的限制。**
僅有在您在委託書上具體授權替換或委託行為時，被認可的代表人士可以根據委託書將授權替換或委託給另一位被認可的代表人士。
在替後，只有新被認可的代表人士才會被認可為納稅人的代表人士。如果權力受到委託，原始和被委託的代表人士都將被國稅局認可代表您。
**向第三方揭露納稅申報表。**
您的代表人士不能簽署允許國稅局向第三方披露納稅申報表或納稅申報表資訊的同意書，除非您在 《表格 2848》第 5a 行具體授權此權力。
**無行為能力或不稱職。**
如果您變得無行為能力或不稱職，委託書通常會終止。
然而，如果您在《表格 2848》的 第 5a 行 —— 「其他授權行為」 表明在您 無行為能力或不稱職的情況下繼續使授權行為生效並且您的非國稅局持久委託書滿足所有國稅局接受的條件，則委託書可持續生效。請參閱後文的 [_非國稅局委託書_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148646 "非國稅局委託書。")內容。
#### 什麼時候需要委託書？
委託書須在當您想授權個人接收您的機密稅務資訊並代表您與國稅局往來時遞交，不論代表人士是否採取了前文 [_委託書是什麼_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148637 "委託書是什麼？") 描述的行為。
委託書通常會在當您想授權另一個人代表您執行下列至少一項行為時需要。
  1. 代表您會晤國稅局。
  2. 對國稅局的查詢準備書面回應並遞交。


#### 必要表單
使用 國稅局《表格 2848》指派一名被認可的代表人士代表您與國稅局往來。被認可代表您與國稅局往來的個人會被列於《表格 2848》的 _第二部分 —— 代表聲明_ 下 。您的代表人士必須完成表單的該部份。
**非國稅局委託書。**
國稅局能接受非國稅局委託書，但必須隨附填寫完成的 《表格 2848》才能使委託書被輸入 集中授權檔案（CAF）系統。如需瞭解更多資訊，請參閱後文的 [_非國稅局委託書處理流程_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148650 "非國稅局委託書處理流程。")內容。
如果您希望使用 《表格 2848》以外的文件授權代表，該文件必須涵蓋下列資訊。
  * 您的姓名以及郵寄地址。
  * 您的社會安全號碼（或您的個人納稅識別號碼（ITIN））和/或僱主識別號碼。
  * 您的員工計劃編號（如適用）。
  * 您的代表人士的姓名和郵寄地址。
  * 涉及的稅種。
  * 聯邦稅表號碼。
  * 涉及的具體年份或時期。
  * 針對遺產稅物事宜，註明死者的過世日期。
  * 明確表達您對授予您的代表人士的權力範圍的意圖。
  * 您的簽名和日期。


您還必須在非國稅局委託書上附上一份由您的代表人士簽署並註明日期的聲明。該聲明也被稱為 代表聲明，是包含在 《表格 2848》的第二部份。該份聲明應記載下列內容：
  1. 本人目前沒有被任何其他權威機構暫時禁止或終止在國稅局前執業的資格或本人的職業沒有被其他機關禁止執業，
  2. 本人受經修訂的 230 號通知（第 10 編子主題 A 31 CFR）中管理如何在國稅局前執業的規範的約束，
  3. 本人被授權代表委託書中的納稅人，並且
  4. 本人是（代表人士的身份，如《表格 2848》第二部分的合資格代表人士名單中所列。）


_**缺失必要資訊。**_
如果您的非國稅局委託書未列舉上述所有資訊，國稅局將不會接受您的非國稅局委託書 。您可以簽署並遞交一份包含所有資訊的完整 《表格 2848》或全新的非國稅局委託書。如果您無法簽署可接受的替代文件，您代理人得以透過下述流程完善（使國稅局可接受）您的非國稅局委託書。
_**完善非國稅局委託書的流程。**_
在下列情況中，您的非國稅局委託書中指明的代理人能夠替您簽屬 《表格 2848》。
  1. 原始的非國稅局委託書授予處理聯邦稅務事務的權力（例如，採取任何行為的一般權力）。
  2. 代理人在《表格 2848》中隨附一份聲明（在受偽證處罰的約束下簽署）， 說明原始非國稅局委託書在司法管轄區的法律中是有效的。


**範例：**
納稅人約翰·埃爾姆簽署了一份非國稅局持久委託書，將他的鄰居和註冊會計師埃德·拉奇指名為他的代理人。委託書授予埃德代表約翰執行任何和所有行為的權力。然而，該份委託書沒有列出具體的稅務相關資訊，例如稅種或稅表號碼。
在約翰簽署委託書後不久，他被宣判無行為能力。在那之後，由約翰申報的前一年度納稅申報表出現了聯邦稅務問題。埃德試圖代表約翰與國稅局往來，但遭受拒絕，因為持久委託書未包含必要的資訊。
如果埃德附上一份聲明（在受偽證處罰的約束下簽署），表明持久委託書在司法管轄區的法律下是有效的，他就能簽署一份完整的 《表格 2848》並代表約翰遞交。如果埃德能在國稅局前執業（請參閱前文 [_誰能在國稅局前執業_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148595 "誰能在國稅局前執業？")），他可以將自己在《表格 2848》中指名為 代表人士。否則，他必須指定另一個可以在國稅局前執業的人士。
_**非國稅局委託書處理流程。**_
國稅局擁有一個集中式電腦資料庫系統，稱為集中授權檔案系統。該系統擁有關於代表納稅人的人士的權限的資訊。一般而言，當您向國稅局遞交委託書文件時，這份文件將被處理以納入集中授權檔案系統。將您的委託書輸入進集中授權檔案系統將使沒有您的委託書的副本的國稅局人員能夠透過存取集中授權檔案系統驗證您的代表人士的權限。如果您指名您的代表人士應收到通知的副本以及國稅局的通訊，這將還能使國稅局自動發送這些通訊文件給您的代表人士。
您可以透過將非國稅局委託書隨附在填寫完成的 《表格 2848》並遞交給國稅局以將其被輸入進集中授權檔案系統。您的簽名不是必要項目；然而，您的代理人必須簽屬 _代表聲明_ （請參閱 《表格 2848》的第二部份）。
#### 表單填寫 —— 有用技巧提示
《表格 2848》的填寫範本在後文中的 [_我該如何填寫《表格 2848》_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148681 "我該如何填寫 《表格 2848》？")列舉。然而，下列內容也將幫助您填寫表格。
**逐行技巧提示。**
下列技巧提示是《表格 2848》的一些逐行說明摘要資訊。
_**Line 1—Taxpayer information. （第 1 行 —— 納稅人資訊。）**_
如涉及聯合申報，如果丈夫和太太都希望指定一位代表人士，則兩人都必須個別申報《表格 2848》，即便是代表人士是同一人也一樣。如果只有一個配偶希望在此事中指定代表人士，則由該名配偶申報《表格 2848》。未滿 18 歲且無法簽名的納稅人，可由其父母或法院指定監護人（帶法庭文件）代為簽字。如果其它的個人擁有一份由父母或法院指定的監護人簽署的《表格 2848》並授權該個人代表納稅人簽字，則該名個人得以為納稅人簽字。
_**Line 2—Representative(s). (第 2 行 —— 代表人士。)**_
僅有個人得以被指名為代表人士。如果您的代表人士未被指派集中授權檔案號碼。請在該行輸入 「無」 ，國稅局就會為您的代表人士發放一組集中授權檔案號碼。如果代表人士的地址或電話號碼自集中授權檔案號碼發放後有所變更，您應勾選適當的複選框。請輸入您的代表人士的傳真號碼（如有）。
如果您想指定四名以上的代表人士，請附上額外的《表格 2848》。國稅局將向您最多兩名的代表人士發送通知和通訊的副本。然而，如果您希望國稅局定期向您的代表人士發送通知和通訊的副本，您 **必須** 選取《表格 2848》第 2 行的方塊。如果您不勾選方塊，您的代表人士將不會定期收到通知和通訊的副本。
_**Line 3—Acts authorized (Tax matters). (第 3 行 —— 被授權的行為（稅務事宜）。)**_
您可以列出您在簽屬委託書當日的當前年度/期間以及在此前的任何稅務年度或期間。您也可以列舉未來稅務年度或期間。**然而，國稅局將不會在集中授權檔案系統中紀錄自國稅局收到委託書當年 12 月 31 日起超過 3 年且被列舉的未來納稅年度或期間。** 請勿使用廣泛的參照詞彙，例如 「所有年份、」 「所有期限，」 或 「所有稅務。」 國稅局將會退回使用廣泛的參照詞彙的委託書。
_**Line 4—Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). (第 4 行 —— 未記錄在集中授權檔案（CAF）的具體事宜。)**_
特定事宜無法記錄在集中授權檔案系統中。此類事項的範例包括但不限於以下內容（更詳細的 清單隨附於《表格 2848》說明）。

  * 資訊自由法要求的事項。


如果《表格 2848》 第 3 行描述的稅務事宜具體涉及其中一個事項，請勾選第 4 行的複選框。如果勾選此複選框，代表人士應將委託書郵寄或傳真到處理此事的國稅局辦公室。否則，代表人士應在每次與國稅局會晤時攜帶委託書副本。
#### 在哪裡提交委託書
一般而言，您可以直接向國稅局郵寄或傳真一份紙本《表格 2848》。如要判定您該向何處申報 《表格 2848》，請參閱《表格 2848》說明的 _何處申報_ 內容。

#### 撤銷委託書/取消代表人士
**由納稅人撤銷。**
如果您想撤銷之前簽署的委託書並且不想指定新的代表人士，您必須在《表格 2848》第一頁的最上方寫上「撤銷」，並在此標註的正下方加上當前簽名和日期。然後，您必須將帶有撤銷標註的委託書副本依照《表格 2848》說明的 _申報地點表_ 郵寄或傳真給國稅局，或如果該委託書是針對特定事項，請申報給處理該事項的國稅局辦公室。
如果您沒有希望撤銷的委託書的副本，您必須向國稅局發送一份撤銷聲明，表明委託書的權限被撤銷、列出事項和年份/期間，並列出希望撤銷權力的被認可代表人士的姓名和地址。您必須在此聲明上簽名並註明日期。如果您要完全撤銷權限，請寫下「刪除所有年份/期限」而不是列出具體事項和年份/期限。
**由代表人士撤銷。**
如果您的代表人士不再希望擔任代表人士，他或她必須在《表格 2848》第一頁的最上方寫下「取消」，並在標註的下方加上當前簽名和日期。然後，他或她必須以與上述 [_由納稅人撤銷_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink100030094 "由納稅人撤銷。") 相同的方式向國稅局提供一份帶有撤回標註的委託書的副本。如果您的代表沒有他或她希望取消的委託書的副本，他或她必須向國稅局發送一份取消聲明，表明已取消委託書賦予的權力，列出事項和年份/期間，並列舉納稅人的姓名、納稅人識別號碼和地址（如果知道）。代表人士必須在此聲明上簽名並註明日期。
學生持有的委託書將自收到日起在集中授權檔案系統中記錄 130 天。如果您在該時間後授權學生代表您，您將需要提交另一份更新的《表格 2848》。
#### 什麼時候不需要委託書？
當第三方不作為您的代表人士與國稅局往來時，即不需要委託書。下列情況不需要委託書。
  * 向國稅局提供資訊。
  * 使用 《表格 8821 —— _稅務資訊授權》，_ 或其他紙本或口頭揭露同意書授權揭露納稅申報表的資訊。
  * 允許國稅局透過納稅申報表或其他文件上提供的複選框與第三方討論納稅申報表上的資訊。
  * 允許合夥企業代表（PR）在 2017 年 12 月 31 日之後開始的稅務年度在集中式夥伴企業稽核制度下為合夥企業採取行為；然而，請參閱 下方提早選擇的警告內容。
  * 允許稅務事項合夥人（TMP）在 2018 年 1 月 1 日前結束的合夥企業稅務年度為合夥企業採取行為。
  * 允許國稅局與受託人討論納稅申報表的資訊。


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_對於 2017 年 12 月 31 日之後開始的合夥企業稅務年度，2015 年的兩黨預算法案廢除了稅務平等和財政責任法案合夥企業稽核和訴訟流程以及適用於選出大型合夥企業的規則，並以新的集中式合夥企業稽核制度取而代之，並以「合夥企業代表」取代「稅務事務合夥人」。 根據財政部條例第 301.9100-22T 條，特定合夥企業可以選擇將新制度用於在 2015 年 11 月 2 日至 2018 年 1 月 1 日之間的稅務年度的合夥企業納稅申報表。_.
#### 我該如何填寫 《表格 2848》？
下列範例說明了如何填寫 《表格 2848》。
**範例：**
斯坦和瑪麗·多伊被告知他們在 2014、2015，以及 2016 年聯合申報的 所得稅表（《表格 1040》）正在被檢驗。他們已決定指派註冊報稅代理人吉姆·史密斯代表他們處理此事以及關於這些納稅申報表的任何未來事務。吉姆多年來一直在相同的地點填寫納稅申報表，並擁有一組向他簽發的集中授權檔案（CAF）號碼。瑪麗不希望吉姆代表她簽署任何協議，但斯坦願意讓吉姆這樣做。斯坦和瑪麗還授權吉姆使用中間服務廠商存取他們的國稅局記錄。他們希望所有通知和紙本通訊的副本都會向吉姆發送。這是斯坦和瑪麗第一次向任何人提供委託書。他們應該要個別填寫一份 如下的《表格 2848》。
**Line 1—Taxpayer information. （第 1 行 —— 納稅人資訊。）**
斯坦和瑪麗必須各自申報一份單獨的《表格 2848》。斯坦在他個別的《表格 2848》空格中填入他的姓名、地址，以及社會安全號碼。瑪麗在她個別的《表格 2848》也採取相同的行為。
**Line 2—Representative(s). （第 2 行 —— 代表人士。）**
在各自的 《表格 2848》中，斯坦和瑪麗分別填入了他們選擇的代表人士吉姆·史密斯的姓名和目前的地址。斯坦和瑪麗都希望吉姆·史密斯針對第 3 行涉及的內容收到通知和通訊，因此在他們個別的《表格 2848》中，斯坦和瑪麗分別勾選了第 2 行第一列的複選框。他們還填入了史密斯先生的集中授權檔案號碼、他的報稅員稅務識別號碼（PTIN）、他的電話號碼和他的傳真號碼。史密斯先生的地址、電話號碼和傳真號碼自國稅局簽發他的集中授權檔案號碼以來一直沒有改變，因此斯坦和瑪麗沒有勾選第二列中的複選框。
**Line 3—Acts authorized (Tax matters). （第 3 行 —— 授權行為（稅務事宜）。）**
在他們個別的《表格 2848》中，斯坦和瑪麗各自填入 「所得稅」 作為事項描述，「1040」 作為表格號碼，以及 「2014、2015，以及 2016」 作為稅務年份。
**Line 4—Specific use not recorded on Centralized Authorization File (CAF). （第 4 行 —— 未記錄在集中授權檔案（CAF）的具體事宜。）**
在他們個別的《表格 2848》中，斯坦和瑪麗沒有在這一行填入任何內容，因為他們不想將他們的委託書用途限制在集中授權檔案上沒有記錄的特定用途。請參閱前文 [_表單填寫 —— 有用技巧提示_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148651 "表單填寫 —— 有用技巧提示")的內容。
**Line 5—Additional acts authorized and restrictions. （第 5 行 —— 授權的其他行為和限制。）**
瑪麗希望親自簽署任何改變她和斯坦在 2014、2015 和 2016 年的共同所得稅義務的協議。因此，她在她的《表格 2848》第 5b 行寫到 「任何協議表格皆必須由納稅人簽屬」 。斯坦不希望限制吉姆·史密斯在這方面的權限，因此他將《表格 2848》的第 5b 行留白。如果瑪麗或斯坦選擇加入其他限制，他們可以個別在《表格 2848》的第 5b 行列出其他限制。此外，瑪麗和斯坦都勾選了 第 5a 行的「透過中間服務廠商獲取我的國稅局記錄」複選框，以允許吉姆透過中間服務廠商存取他們在國稅局的記錄。
**Line 6—Retention/revocation of prior power(s) of attorney. （第 6 行 —— 保留/撤銷先前的委託書。）**
斯坦和瑪麗都是首次申報委託書，所以他們沒有在該行上填入內容。然而，如果他們過去曾申報過委託書，除非他們勾選第 6 行的複選框並附上一份他們希望維持效力的過去委託書的副本，則申報此最新的委託書將撤銷任何先前針對相同稅務事項申報的委託書。
如果瑪麗在日後決定她可以自行處理檢驗，即便斯坦沒有撤銷他的委託書，她也能夠撤銷她的委託書。（請參閱前文 [_委託書撤銷/取消_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148663 "撤銷委託書/取消代表人士")以瞭解適用的特殊條款。）
**Line 7—Signature of taxpayer. （第 7 行 —— 納稅人簽屬。）**
斯坦和瑪麗各自在他或她的 《表格 2848》上簽名並註明日期。如果納稅人未簽屬，國稅局就無法接受該表格。
**Part II—Declaration of Representative. （第二部分 —— 代表聲明。）**
必須由吉姆·史密斯填寫 《表格 2848》這部分的內容。如果他不簽署此部分，國稅局將無法接受該表格。
#### 委託書在提交後的處理流程為何？
委託書在被國稅局接收、審查，以及判定含有必要的資訊後將會被認可。然而，直到在集中授權檔案系統上輸入委託書前，國稅局人員可能還無法得知您指定代表您的人士的權力。因此，在此過渡期間，國稅局人員可能會要求您或您的代表人士在與國稅局在進行任何會議時攜帶副本。
#### 處理和建檔
委託書如何被處理和編列取決於該份委託書是否是完整的文件。
**不完整的文件。**
如果《表格 2848》不是完整的，國稅局將嘗試透過寫信或打電話聯絡您或您的代表人士來確認遺失的資訊。例如，如果缺失您的簽名或簽名日期，國稅局將聯絡您。如果缺失的資訊是涉及您的代表人士，並且文件上的資訊是足夠與代表人士聯絡的（例如地址和/或電話號碼），國稅局將會嘗試聯絡您的代表人士。
在任何一種情況下，直到在文件上填入所有必要的資訊後，委託書才會被視為有效的。在文件完整填寫並且被國稅局接受前，被指定為代表人士的個人均不會被認可為代表您在國稅局前執業。
**完整文件。**
如果委託書是完整填寫並且有效的，國稅局將會採取行動認可代表人士。在大多數的情況下，這包含了在集中授權檔案系統中處理文件。在集中授權檔案系統上記錄資料使國稅局能夠將郵件副本直接發送給被授權的代表人士，並輕鬆分辨被授予的權限範圍。
_**不在集中授權檔案系統上處理的文件。**_
特定用途的委託書不會在集中授權檔案系統上處理（請參閱前文 [_表單填寫 —— 有用技巧提示_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p947zht#zh-hant_201709_publink1000148651 "表單填寫 —— 有用技巧提示")的內容）。例如，一次性委託書或特殊情形授權皆不會在集中授權檔案系統上處理。這些文件會保留在相關案件的檔案中。在這種情況下，您應該勾選 《表格 2848》 第 4 行的複選框。在這些情況下，代表人士應在每次與國稅局會晤時攜帶委託書副本。
#### 與代表人士往來
申報有效的委託書後，國稅局將認可您的代表人士。然而，如果該代表人士在反覆請求後因未能提供非特殊權限資訊而導致不合理地拖延或阻礙國稅局事務被迅速地處理，則國稅局得以直接與您聯絡。例如，在大多數委託書被認可的情況中，國稅局會聯絡代表人士安排會面時間並向代表人士提供必要項目的清單。然而，如果代表人士沒有空、沒有回應重複提出的請求，並且沒有提供必要的項目（被視為特殊權限的項目除外），國稅局得以越過您的代表人士並直接與您聯絡。
如果代表人士出現上述行為，此行為得以被通報給專業責任辦公室，斟酌判處可能的紀律處分。
**通知和其他信件。**
如果您想授權您的代表人士接收國稅局發送給您的所有通知和通訊的副本，您必須勾選代表人士的姓名和地址下方提供的複選框。**收到國稅局發送給您的通知和通訊副本的代表人士不得超過兩名。** 如果您不希望將通知和通訊副本發送給您的代表人士，請不要勾選此複選框。
### 備註。
代表人士收到的信件不會隨附表格、刊物和其他相關內容。
