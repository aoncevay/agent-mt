# 간행물 519 (2024), 외국인을 위한 미국 세금 안내
_2024_ 세금 신고서 작성에 사용
# 간행물 519 - 소개 자료
## 향후 진전 사항
발행된 후 제정된 법률과 같은 간행물 519과 관련된 최신 진전 사항은 [IRS.gov/Pub519](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-519)를 방문하십시오.
#### 소개
세금 목적상으로 외국인은 미국 시민이 아닌 개인입니다. 외국인은 비거주 외국인과 거주 외국인으로 분류됩니다. 이 간행물은 귀하의 신분을 결정하는 것을 도우며 미국 세금 신고서 제출을 위해 필요한 정보를 제공합니다. 거주 외국인은 일반적으로 미국시민과 똑같이 전세계 출처 소득에 대해 과세됩니다. 비거주 외국인은 미국내에 원천 소득과 미국에서 거래 또는 사업 활동과 연관된 특정 소득에 대해서만 과세됩니다.

#### 비거주 외국인
외국인의 경우 (미국 시민이 아닌), 아래의 _[거주자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222118 "거주 외국인")_ 에 설명된 두 개의 테스트 중 하나를 충족하지 않는다면 비거주 외국인으로 고려합니다.
#### 거주 외국인
2024년 역년에 (1월 1일부터 12월 31일까지) 그린카드 테스트를 충족하거나 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하면 조세 목적으로 미국의 거주 외국인이 됩니다. 이 두 테스트 중 어떤 것도 충족하지 못하더라도, 해당 연도의 일부 동안 미국 거주자로 간주되도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 뒷부분에 _‘이중 신분 외국인’_ 아래 _[_첫 해 선택_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222172 "첫 해 선택")_ 을 참고하십시오.
#### 그린카드 테스트
2024년 역년 한 해 동안에 어느 시점이라도 미국의 법적 영주권자였다면, 조세 목적으로 거주자입니다. (단, 추후에 [_이중 신분 외국인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222162 "이중 신분 외국인")을 참고) 이는 그린카드 테스트라고 알려져 있습니다. 귀하가 이민법에 따라 그 어느 시점에 미국에 이민자로 영원히 거주할 특권을 가졌다면 귀하는 법적 영주권자입니다. 미국 이민국 (USCIS) (또는 그 전신)에서 그린카드라고 도 알려진 양식 I-551, ‘영주권자 카드’를 귀하에게 발급하였다면 귀하는 일반적으로 법적 영주권자 신분을 갖고 있습니다. 귀하는 거주자 신분을 박탈당하거나, 행정적 또는 법적으로 이를 포기했다고 판단되지 않는 한, 이 테스트에 의해서 지속적으로 거주자 신분을 갖습니다.
### 비고.
어느 한 개인이 그린카드 테스트에 부합하더라도, 이 개인이 미국 조세협정 타이브레이커 규칙에 따라 해외 거주지를 주장한다면, 이들은 조세 채무의 목적으로 비거주자로 간주될 것입니다. 섹션 7701(b)(6)(B)를 참조하십시오.
**거주자 신분 박탈.**
미국 정부가 귀하에게 최종 행정적, 법적 배제 또는 추방 명령을 내린다면 거주자 신분을 박탈당한 것으로 고려됩니다. 최종 법적 명령은 더 이상 관할 구역의 상급 법원에 항고할 수 없게 된 명령을 말합니다. 
**거주자 신분 포기.**
행정적 또는 법적 영주권 포기 판단은 귀하, USCIS, 또는 미국 영사관에 의해 제기될 수 있습니다.
귀하가 포기 판단을 하는 경우 영주권자 카드 (그린 카드 또는 양식 I-551)를 첨부하여 다음의 문서들을 USCIS, 또는 미국 영사관에 제출하면 귀하의 영주권은 포기된 것으로 간주됩니다. 
  * [양식 I-407(영어)](https://www.uscis.gov/i-407), 법적 영주권 신분 포기 기록 또는
  * 귀하의 거주자 신분을 포기하는 목적의 편지.


우편으로 제출할 때, 귀하는 반드시 등기 우편으로 보내야 합니다. (또는 외국의 동등한 방식으로) 그리고 우편으로 보내고 받았다는 사본이나 진술서를 보관해야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_그린카드가 10년 이상 되었거나 일정 기간 미국에 살지 않았다는 이유로 USCIS가 귀하의 그린카드의 유효성을 인정하지 않았다고 할지라도 귀하가 편지 수신의 증명이 있기 전까지는 조세 목적으로 거주 외국인 신분이 유지됩니다._.
USCIS 또는 미국 영사관이 거주자 신분 취소 결정을 제기한다면, 포기에 대한 최종 행정 명령이 발부되었을 때 귀하의 거주자 신분은 포기된 것으로 간주될 것입니다. 관할 연방 법원에 항소 제기가 허용된다면, 최종 법적 명령이 요구됩니다. 
미국 이민 법에 의하면 거주자로서 세금 신고서 제출이 요구되고 이를 수행하지 못한 법적 영주권자는 신분을 포기한 것으로 간주될 수도 있고 영주권 신분을 상실할 수도 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_법적 영주권자 신분이 중단된 장기 거주자(LTR)들에게는 특별 신고 요건 및 세금 조항이 적용될 수 있습니다. 4장에서_[국적포기세](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222368 "국적포기세") _를 참고하십시오._.
_**2008년 6월 16일 이후 거주 종료.**_
귀하의 거주 종료 날짜에 대한 더 자세한 내용은, 4장의 _2008년 6월 16일 이후 종료_ 에서[ _이전 LTR_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100023907 "이전 LTR.")을 참고하십시오.
### 비고.
2008년 6월 17일 전에 영구 출국하는 납세자에 대한 요구사항은 더 이상 양식 8854의 지침 또는 간행물 519에서 다루지 않습니다. 2008년 6월 17일 이전의 영구 출국에 대한 정보는 2018년 양식 8854의 지침 및 2018년 [간행물 519(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p519.pdf)의 4장을 참고하십시오.
#### 상당한 체류 테스트
귀하가 2024년 역년 한 해 동안 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족한다면 조세 목적으로 거주자입니다. 이 테스트를 충족하기 위해, 귀하는 적어도 다음 기간동안 미국에 실질적으로 체류해야 합니다.
  1. 2024년 한 해 동안 31일, 그리고
  2. 2024, 2023, 2022년을 포함하는 3년의 기간 동안 183일, 다음과 같이 산정합니다.
    1. 2024년 귀하가 체류한 모든 일수 그리고
    2. 2023년 귀하가 체류한 일수 중 1/3 그리고
    3. 2022년 귀하가 체류한 일수 중 1/6.


**예시.**
귀하는 2024, 2023, 2022년에 미국에서 각각 120일을 실질적으로 체류했습니다. 2024년에 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하는지 결정하기 위해, 2024년에 거주했던 총 120일, 2023년의 40일, (120일 중 1/3 ) 그리고 2022년에 20일 (120일 중1/6 )을 포함하십시오. 3년의 기간 동안 총 180일 이였기 때문에, 귀하는 상당한 체류 테스트에 따라서 2024년에는 거주자로 고려되지 않습니다.
“United States” (미국)은 다음의 영역을 포함합니다.
  * 미국은 50개 주와 컬럼비아 특별구.
  * 미국의 영해.
  * 국제법상 천연 자원의 탐험과 사용에 대한 미국이 독점적 권한을 가지는 미국 영해 가까이 위치한 해양 지역의 해저와 심토.


이 용어에는 미국 영토 또는 미국 영공은 포함하지 않습니다. 
#### 미국 체류 기간
귀하가 해당 일에 어느 시간에라도 미국에 실질적으로 체류한 날에 대해 이 나라에 체류한 것으로 간주합니다. 하지만 이 규칙에는 예외가 있습니다. 아래와 같이 미국에서 체류한 날짜들을 상당한 체류 테스트 시 계산하지 마십시오.
  * 귀하가 정기적으로 캐나와 또는 멕시코에서 통근하였다면 캐나다 또는 멕시코의 거주지에서 통근한 날.
  * 그리고 미국 외의 두 장소에서 경유했을 때 24시간 미만으로 미국에 체류한 날의 일수.
  * 외국 선박의 선원으로 미국에 체류한 일수.
  * 미국 체류중에 발생한 질병 때문에 미국을 떠날 수 없었던 날의 일수.
  * NATO 군인 또는 민간인의 일원으로서 NATO 비자로 미국에서 체류한 날. 하지만 이 예외는 NATO 비자로 미국에 체류한 부양가족에게는 적용되지 않습니다. 상당한 체류 테스트의 목적으로 부양가족 구성원은 반드시 체류했던 모든 날을 산정해야 합니다.
  * 면제 개인이었던 날의 일수.


아래의 각 범주들에 적용되는 특정 규칙들에 대해 다음에서 설명합니다. 
**캐나다와 멕시코 정기 통근자.**
캐나와와 멕시코에서 정기적으로 통근한다면 캐나다나 멕시코에 위치한 거주지에서 미국으로 직장을 위해 통근한 날은 계산하지 마십시오. 근로 기간 중 근로 일 수의 75% (0.75) 이상을 미국에서 일하기 위해 통근하였다면 정기적으로 통근한 것으로 간주합니다.
이 목적으로 “통근”이란 일을 하기 위해 이동하였다가 24시간 기간 내에 본인의 거주지로 돌아오는 것을 의미합니다. “근로 일” 미국 또는 캐나다, 멕시코에서 일을 한 날을 의미합니다. “근로 기간”은 일을 하기 위해 미국에 실질적으로 체류한 당해 연도에 첫 번째 날에 시작하여 일하기 위해 미국에 실질적으로 체류한 당해 연도의 마지막 날에 끝이납니다. 일이 미국에서 한시적으로 또는 주기적으로 머물러야 하는 것이라면, 근로 기간은 일하기 위해 미국에 체류한 해당 기한의 첫날에 주기의 첫날에 시작하여 일하기 위해 미국에 체류한 기한 또는 주기의 마지막 날에 끝이 납니다. 1년 (역년)에 한개 이상의 근로 기간을 가질 수 있으며 귀하의 근로 기간은 한 해에 시작하여 다음 해에 끝날 수도 있습니다. 
**예시.**
마리아 페레즈는 멕시코에 살고 있고 멕시코에 사무실이 있는 ABC라는 회사를 다니고 있으나 2월 1일 부터 6월 1일까지 미국에 있는 회사 사무실로 임시 파견되었습니다. 6월 2일에, 마리아는 멕시코에서 다시 고용되었습니다. 69 근로 일 동안 마리아는 매일 아침 멕시코의 집에서 ABC 회사의 미국 사무실로 일하기 위해 통근했습으며 매일 저녁 멕시코에 본인의 집으로 돌아갔습니다. 7 근로일 동안, 마리아는 본인의 회사 멕시코 사무실에서 일했습니다. 상당한 체류 테스트의 목적으로 마리아는 미국에서 일하기 위해 통근 한 날은 산정하지 않았습니다. 왜냐하면 그 날은 근로 기간동안 일한 날의 75% (0.75)를 넘기 때문입니다. (근로 기간에 근로일이 76일로 미국에서 일한 69일은 90.8%와 같습니다).
**경유한 날의 일수.**
미국외의 두 장소에서 경유했으며 24시간 미만으로 미국에 체류한 날은 산정하지 않습니다. 외국 목적지로 이동을 완료하는 것과 상당히 관련된 활동을 하는 경우는 경유 중 이였던 것으로 간주 됩니다. 예를 들어, 목적지로 가는 도중에 비행기의 환승을 위해 미국의 공항에서 이동하였다면 경유 중으로 고려됩니다. 하지만, 미국에 있는 동안 사업 회의에 참여 했다면, 경유 중에 있다고 간주되지 않습니다. 회의를 공항에서 했더라도 마찬가지입니다.
**선원.**
미국과 외국 또는 미국 영토 사이에 수송하는 외국 선박 (보트 또는 배)의 정규 선원으로 미국에 일시적으로 체류한 날은 산정하지 마십시오. 하지만, 만약 이와 다르게 그 기간 동안에 미국에서 거래나 사업을 했다면 이 예외는 적용되지 않습니다. 
**질병.**
미국을 떠나려고 했으나, 질병이나 미국에 체류하는 동안 일어난 문제로 인해 떠날 수 없었던 날들은 계산하지 마십시오. 특정한 날에 미국을 떠나고자 하는지의 여부는 모든 사실과 상황에 기초하여 결정됩니다. 예를 들어 귀하가 상당한 체류 테스트에 적격하기에 충분히 길지 않은 기간 동안 미국을 방문한 목적이 완료 되었다면, 출국 의도가 있었다는 것을 성립할 수 있을 것입니다. 하지만, 귀하가 방문의 목적을 완료하기 위해 연장된 기간을 필요하고 그 기간으로 인해 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하게 된다면, 귀하는 연장된 기간이 만료되기 전에 미국을 출국하려는 의도가 성립되지 않을 수 있습니다. 
정신적으로 부적격하다고 판단된 개인의 경우, 미국을 떠나려던 의도의 증명은 개인이 정신적 부적격 판정을 받기 전에 행동의 패턴을 분석하여 판단합니다. 질병으로 거주한 날을 면제 받을 자격이 된다면, 반드시 양식 8843을 완전하게 작성하여 IRS에 제출해야 합니다. 추후에 [_양식 8843_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222149 "양식 8843.")을 참고하십시오.
다음과 같은 상황에서 미국에 체류했던 날을 제외할 수 없습니다. 
  * 처음에는 출국이 금지 되었다가 이후에 출국 할 수 있었지만 출국을 준비할 타당한 기간을 초과해서 미국에 남아 있었던 경우.
  * 이전에 머물렀던 기간에 발생한 질병 치료를 위해 미국으로 돌아온 경우.
  * 미국 도착 전에 이 질병이 존재하였으며 이 질병을 인식하고 있었던 경우. 미국에 입국 시에 이 질병에 대한 치료가 필요한지 여부는 문제가 되지 않습니다.


**면제 개인.**
면제 개인이였던 날들은 계산하지 마십시오. “exempt individual” (면제 개인)이란 용어는 미국 세금 면제 대상을 의미하지 않습니다. 다만, 다음의 범주에 포함된 사람을 의미합니다. 
  * 외국 정부 관련 개인으로 “A-3” 또는 “G-5” 등급 비자를 소지한 개인이 아닌 “A” 또는 “G” 비자로 미국에 일시적으로 체류하는 개인

  * 미국보다 외국과 더 밀접한 관계를 갖고있으며, 
  * 조세 거주지가 해당 외국임.


앞서 말한 [_외국과 더 밀접한 관계_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222151 "외국과 더 밀접한 관계")를 참고하십시오.

위에서 설명한 것 처럼 필수적인 진술서를 제출하지 않는다면, 외국 또는 외국의 국가들과 더 밀접한 관계를 갖고 있다는 것을 성립할 수 없습니다. 따라서 거주 첫 번째 날은 미국에서 체류한 첫 번째 날이 될 것입니다. 만약 본인이 진술서 제출 요건을 깨닫기 위해 그리고 해당 요건들을 준수하기 위해 상당한 조치를 취했다는 분명하고 확고한 증거를 보여줄 수 있다면 이는 적용되지 않습니다
**그린카드 테스트하의 거주 시작일.**
1년 동안 어느 시점에 그린카드 테스트를 충족했지만 해당 연도에 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하지 않았다면, 거주 시작일은 법적 영주권자로써 미국에 체류한 해당 역년에 첫 번째 날입니다.
상당한 체류 테스트와 그린카드 테스트를 둘다 충족한다면, 거주 시작일은 상당한 체류 테스트에 따라 또는 법적 영주권자로서 미국에 거주한 해의 첫 번째 날 중 더 빠른 날이 됩니다.
**이전 연도 동안의 거주.**
이전 역년 어느 시점에라도 미국 거주자였고 현 년도 어느 시점에라도 미국 거주자였다면, 현 연도의 시작에 미국 거주자로 간주합니다. 이는 상당한 체류 테스트, 또는 그린카드 테스트하에서의 거주자인지 여부에 적용이 됩니다. 
**예시.**
로버트 바크는 스위스 국민입니다. 로버트는 미국 거주자로서 미국에 2023년 5월 1일에 처음 왔습니다. 그리고 2023년 11월 5일까지 머물다가 스위스로 돌아갔습니다. 로버트는 법적 영주권자로서 미국에 2024년 3월 5일에 돌아왔으며 여전히 이곳에 거주하고 있습니다. 2023년 역년에 거주자로서 적격했기 때문에 2024년 역년에 로버트의 미국 거주 시분은 2024년 1월에 시작하는 것으로 간주합니다.
#### 첫 해 선택
2023년 또는 2024년에 그린카드 테스트 또는 상당한 체류 테스트 둘다 충족하지 않으며, 2023년의 일부에 대해 거주자로 취급되기로 선택하지 않았지만 2024년에 대해 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하였다면, 2024년의 일부 동안 미국 거주자로 취급되기로 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 하기 위해:
  1. 2024년에 적어도 31일 연속으로 미국에 체류해야 하며,
  2. 31일 기간의 첫 번째 날에 시작하여 2024년 마지막 날에 끝난 날 일수의 75% 이상 미국에 체류해야 합니다. 이 75% 테스트의 목적으로, 미국에서 체류하지 않았던 최대 5일까지 미국에서 체류한 날로 취급할 수 있습니다.


위의 (1)과 (2)에서 거주 일 수를 계산할 때 앞서 언급한 [_미국에서 체류한 날_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222131 "미국 체류 기간")의 예외 사항들은 미국에서 체류한 날로 산정하지 않습니다.
첫 해 선택을 했다면, 2024년 거주 시작일은 (위의 (1)에서 설명한) 이 선택에 적격이 되기 위해 사용한 가장 이른 31일 기간의 첫 번째 날입니다. 해당 연도의 나머지 동안은 미국 거주자로 취급됩니다.1회 이상의 31일 기간을 체류했고 각각의 기간에 대해 위의 조건 (2)를 충족한다면 귀하의 거주 시작일은 첫 31일 기간의 첫 번째 날이 됩니다. 1회 이상의 31일 기간을 체류했지만 오직 이후의 31일 기간에서만 위에 언급된 (2) 조건을 충족한다면 거주 시작일은 이 이후의 31일 기간의 첫 번째 날이 됩니다.
### 비고.
이 선택을 하기 위해 기혼일 필요는 없습니다.
**예시 1.**
후안 다실바는 필리핀 국민입니다. 후안은 미국에 2024년 11월 1일에 미국에 처음 입국했으며 31일 연속으로 체류했습니다. (2024년 11월 1일 부터 12월 1일까지). 후안은 12월 1일에 필리핀으로 돌아갔으며 미국에 2024년 12월 17일에 재입국하여 나머지 기간 동안 미국에 체류합니다. 2025년 동안 후안은 상당한 체류 테스트에 따라 미국의 거주 외국인입니다. 후안은 2024년에 연속으로 31일 기간 동안 (11월 1일 부터 12월 1일까지) 체류했으며, 또한 31일 기간의 첫 번째 날까지 75% (0.75) 이상 미국에 체류했기 때문에 ((미국에서 체류한 46일을 11월 1일에서 12월 31일까지 61일로 나누면 75.4% (0.754)) 후안은 2024년에 대한 첫 해 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 만약 후안이 첫해 선택을 한다면, 후안의 거주 시작일은 2024년 11월 1일이 될 것입니다.
**예시 2.**
후안이 12월 24, 25, 29, 30, 31일에 미국에 없었단 것을 제외하면 이 상황은 _예시 1_ 에서와 같습니다. 체류하지 않았던 5일까지는 75% (0.75) 테스트의 목적 상 체류로 간주하기 때문에 후안은 2024년에 대해 첫해 선택을 할 수 있습니다.
_**2024년에 대해 첫해 선택을 위해 요구되는 진술서.**_
2024년에 대해 첫해 선택을 위해 양식 1040, 또는 1040-SR에 진술서를 첨부해야 합니다. 이 진술서에는 반드시 이름과 주소, 그리고 구체적으로 다음 사항이 포함되어야 합니다.

### 비고.
해당 연도 말에 미혼이라면, 이 선택을 할 수 없습니다.

### 비고.
과세연도의 말에 한 배우자가 비거주 외국인이고 다른 배우자가 미국 시민 또는 거주자라면, 비슷한 선택이 가능합니다. 추후에 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")를 참고하십시오. 이전에 선택을 했고 여전히 효력이 있다면, 여기에서 설명하고 있는 선택을 하지 않아도 됩니다.
**선택하기.**
귀하 및 귀하의 배우자가 이 선택을 한다면, 양식 1040 혹은 1040–SR의 _Filing Status_ (납세자 구분) 섹션에 있는 박스를 체크하시고 기입란에 이중 신분 배우자(들)의 성명을 기입한 다음, 선택한 연도의 공동 신고서에 두 배우자 모두가 서명한 진술서를 첨부해야 합니다. 이 진술서에는 반드시 다음의 정보를 포함되어야 합니다.

#### 거주 마지막 연도
2024년에 미국의 거주자였지만 2025년 중 일부는 거주자 아니였다면, 미국 거주 종료일에 미국 거주자 신분이 소멸합니다. 거주 종료 일은 추후에 설명하는 것 처럼 더 이른 날짜에 대해 적격하지 않는다면 2024년 12월 31일입니다.
**더 이른 거주 종료일.**
12월 31일 보다 더 이른 거주 종료일에 적격 할 수 있습니다. 그 날짜는: 
  1. 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족한다면, 실질적으로 미국에 체류한 2024년의 마지막 날,

  3. 두 테스트에 모두 충족한다면 (1)과 (2) 중 더 늦은 날.


2024년의 나머지 날 동안 본인의 조세 거주지가 외국이었고 해당 외국 국가와 더 밀접한 관계를 가지는 경우에만 이 날짜를 사용할 수 있습니다. 앞 부분의 [_외국과 더 밀접한 관계_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222151 "외국과 더 밀접한 관계")를 참고하십시오. 
### 비고.
다른 국가의 해당 타이브레이커 조약 조항을 따른 거주을 주장하면 12월 31일 이전의 거주 종료일이 발생할 수도 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_법적 영주권자 신분이 소멸된 장기 거주자 (LTR)에게는 특별 신고 요건 및 세금 조항이 적용 될 수 있습니다. 4장에서_[국적포기세](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222368 "국적포기세") _를 참고하십시오._.
_**거주 종료.**_
귀하의 거주 종료에 대한 정보를 얻으려면, 4장의 _2008년 6월 16일 이후 종료_ 에서 [_이전 LTR_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100023907 "이전 LTR.")을 참고하십시오.
**최소허용기준 체류.**
상당한 체류 테스트의 이유로 미국 거주자이며, 조기 거주 종료일을 사용할 자격이 된다면, 거주 종료일 결정 시 미국에 실제 체류했던 10일까지 제외할 수 있습니다. 10일까지 제외 여부를 결정할 때, 다음과 같은 규칙이 적용됩니다. 
  * 모든 기간에 총 날짜가 10일을 초과하지 않은 한, 한 번 이상의 체류 기간으로부터의 날짜를 제외시킬 수 있습니다.
  * 만약 해당 기간에 어느 한 날을 제외할 수 없다면, 연속 체류 날짜의 기간에 어떤 날도 제외할 수 없습니다.
  * 거주 종료일을 결정할 때 체류한 최대 10일을 제외할 수 있긴 하지만, 반드시 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하는지를 결정할 때는 그 날들을 반드시 포함해야 합니다.


**예시.**
롤라 보바리는 몰타의 시민입니다. 롤라는 2024년 3월 1일 미국에 처음 입국했으며 2024년 8월 25일까지 거주했습니다. 롤라는 2024년 12월 12일에 휴가로 미국에 와서 머물렀다가 2024년 12월 16일에 몰타로 다시 돌아갔습니다. 롤라는 2024년 8월 25일을 시작으로, 미국을 떠난 시점부터 2024년에 몰타와 더 밀접한 연관이 있다고 성립할 수 있습니다. 롤라가 183일간 (3월 1일부터 8월 25일까지 178일에 12월의 5일을 더해서 )동안 미국에 체류했기 때문에 롤라는 상당한 체류 테스트하에 거주자입니다. 그러나 롤라는 거주 종료 날짜 판명을 위해 12월의 미국 방문을 제외할 수 있으므로, 롤라의 거주 종료 날짜는 2024년 8월 25일 입니다.
**다음 연도의 거주.**
2025년 어느 시점에 라도 미국 거주자이고 2024년의 어느 한 시점에라도 거주자였다면, 2024년 말까지 거주자로 간주됩니다. 이는 2024년 동안 미국 보다 외국과 더 밀접한지의 여부, 상당한 체류 테스트, 또는 그린카드 테스트하에서 거주자인 여부가 적용하지 않습니다. 
**거주 종료일을 성립하기 위해 요구되는 진술서.**
거주 종료일을 성립하기 위해 IRS에 반드시 진술서를 제출해야 합니다. 이 진술서에 서명과 날짜를 기입해야하며 위증죄 처벌의 조건으로 이 진술을 한다는 것을 포함해야 합니다. 이 진술서 서류는 반드시 다음의 정보를 포함해야 합니다. (해당하는 경우). 
  * 이름, 주소, 미국 TIN (있다면), 그리고 미국 비자 번호 (있다면).
  * 여권 번호와 여권을 발부한 국가 이름.
  * 진술서가 적용되는 과세연도.
  * 해당 연도에 미국에서 체류한 마지막 날.
  * 해당 연도에 법적 영주권자 신분 포기 또는 철회한 후에 또는 그해에 미국에서 체류한 마지막 날 이후에 외국에 조세 거주지를 유지해왔다는것과 외국과 더 밀접한 관계가 있다는 것을 성립하기 위한 충분한 사실.
  * 법적 영주권자 신분이 포기되거나 철회된 날짜.
  * 법적 영주권자 신분이 포기되었거나 철회 되었다는 것을 입증할 충분한 사실 (관련 문서들의 사본을 포함).

세금 신고서에 이 필수 진술서를 첨부하십시오. 세금 신고서 제출 의무가 없다면, 다음 주소로 진술서를 보내십시오:
Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Austin, TX 73301-0215
양식 1040-NR의 제출 마감일 전까지 진술서를 제출해야 합니다. 제출 마감일은 [7장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222581 "신고 정보")에서 다룹니다.
위에서 설명한 것 처럼 필수 진술서를 제출하지 않는다면, 외국 또는 외국의 국가들에 밀접한 연관을 갖고 있다는 것을 성립할 수 없습니다. 제출 요건들을 준수하기 위해 상당한 조치를 취했다는 분명하고 확고한 증거를 보여줄 수 있다면 이는 적용되지 않습니다. 
#### 거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자
만약 과세연도 말에, 기혼이였고 한 쪽 배우자가 미국인이거나 거주 외국인이고 다른 배우자가 비거주 외국인이였다면, 비거주 외국인인 배우자를 미국 거주자로 간주하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 여기에는 한 명의 배우자가 과세연도 초에 비거주 외국인이지만, 해당 연도 말에는 거주 외국인이고 다른 한명은 비거주 외국인인 상황도 포함됩니다.
이 선택을 하면, 귀하와 배우자는 소득세의 목적으로 전체 과세연도에 대해 거주자로 간주합니다. 본인과 배우자 둘다 그 어떤 조세협정하에 미국 거주자가 아니라고 주장할 수 없습니다. 둘다 모두 전세계 소득에 대해 과세됩니다. 선택을 한 연도에 반드시 공동 신고서를 제출해야 하지만 이 후 연도에는 공동 신고서 또는 개별 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이 조항에 따라서 공동 신고서를 제출한다면,_[6장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222522 "이중 신분 과세연도") _에 나온 이중 신분 납세자에 대한 특별 설명 및 제한은 적용되지 않습니다._.
**예시.**
밥과 샤론 윌리엄스는 부부이고 두명 다 해당 연도 초에 비거주 외국인이였습니다. 밥은 6월에 거주 외국인이 되었으며 그 해의 나머지 동안에 계속해서 거주자였습니다. 밥과 샤론은 양식 1040 또는 1040–SR에 적절한 박스에 체크하고 공동 신고서에 진술서를 첨부하여 두 사람 모두 거주 외국인으로서 간주될 것을 선택했습니다. 밥과 샤론은 그들이 선택을 했던 해에는 반드시 공동 신고서 제출을 해야 합니다. 하지만 그들은 이후 연도에는 공동 신고서 또는 개별 신고서 둘 중에서 어느 것이든 제출 할 수 있습니다.
#### 이 선택을 하는 방법
귀하 및 귀하의 배우자가 이 선택을 한다면, 양식 1040 혹은 1040–SR의 _Filing Status_ (납세자 구분) 섹션에 있는 박스를 체크하시고 기입란에 이중 신분 배우자(들)의 성명을 기입한 다음,이 선택이 적용되는 첫 과세연도의 부부 공동 신고서에 두 배우자 모두가 서명한 진술서를 첨부하십시오. 여기에는 반드시 다음의 정보를 포함해야 합니다.
  * 과세연도의 마지막 날에 배우자 한명이 비거주 외국인이였으며 다른 배우자가 미국인이거나 거주 외국인이며 전체 과세연도에 미국 거주자로 간주하기로 선택한다는 진술서.
  * 각 배우자의 이름, 주소, TIN. (한 명의 배우자가 사망했다면, 사망한 배우자를 위해 선택을 한 사람의 이름과 주소를 포함합니다.)


또한 귀하와 귀하의 비거주 배우자가 이전 연도에 거주자로 간주하기로 선택했으며 이 선택 사항이 계속 유효한 경우, 박스에 체크를 하고 성명을 기입하십시오.
**수정된 신고서.**
일반적으로 공동 신고서 제출 시에 이 선택을 합니다. 하지만, 양식 1040-X를 사용해 수정된 공동 세금 신고서를 제출하여 이 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 첨부하고 수정된 신고서의 윗면에 “Amended” (수정됨)을 입력하십시오. 만약 수정된 세금 신고서에서 이 선택을 하게 되면, 본인과 배우자는 선택을 했던 해 이 후에 제출했었던 모든 세금 신고서를 반드시 수정해야 합니다.
일반적으로 본래 미국 소득세 신고서를 제출하는 날로부터 3년 이내에 또는 해당 해에 소득세를 납부한 날로부터 2년 중 더 늦은 기간까지 수정된 공동 세금 신고서를 반드시 제출해야 합니다. 
#### 선택 중단
만약 배우자 두명 다 과세연도의 어느 한 시점에라도 미국 시민이나 거주 외국인이 아니었다면 거주 외국인으로 간주할 선택은 과세연도 (선택을 한 과세연도)에 중단됩니다. 이는 어느 쪽이라도 [7장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222581 "신고 정보")에서 논의한 비거주 외국인의 제출 요건을 충족한다면 해당 연도에 비거주 외국인으로서 개별 신고서를 제출해야만 한다는 의미입니다.
**예시.**
딕 브라운은 2021년 12월 31일에 거주 외국인이였습니다. 그리고 비거주 외국인인 쥬디와 부부사이 였습니다. 그들은 주디를 거주 외국인으로서 간주할 것을 선택하였고 2021과 2022년에 공동 소득세 신고서를 제출하였습니다. 2023년 1월 10일에, 딕은 비거주 외국인이 되었습니다. 주디는 전체 기간에 비거주 외국인이였습니다. 딕이 그 해의 일부 동안 거주 외국인이였기 때문에 딕과 주디는 2023년에 공동 또는 개별 신고서를 제출했을 수 있습니다. 하지만, 딕과 주디 둘다 2024년 어느 한 순간이라도 거주 외국인이 아니기 때문에 그들의 올해 선택이 유예되었습니다. [7장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222581 "신고 정보")에서 논의했듯이 만약 어느쪽이라도 [비거주 외국인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222588 "비거주 외국인")에 대한 제출 요건을 충족했다면, 그들은 반드시 2024년에 비거주 외국인으로서 개별 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 만약 딕이 2025년에 다시 거주 외국인이 된다면, 그들의 선택은 더 이상 유예되지 않습니다.
#### 선택 종료하기
일단 선택을 하게되면, 거주자로 간주되는 선택은 유예되거나 (앞서 [_선택 중단_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222198 "선택 중단")에서 설명했던 것처럼 ) 또는 다음의 방식으로 종료되지 않는 한은 모든 이후 연도에 적용됩니다.
다음의 방식 중 하나로 선택이 종료되면, 어떤 배우자든 이후의 과세연도에 이 선택을 할 수 없습니다.
  1. 철회. 만약 해당 과세연도에 세금 신고서 제출 마감일까지 철회한다는 가정하에 배우자 둘중 아무나 모든 과세연도에 이 선택을 철회할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 철회하는 배우자는 반드시 선택 철회를 선언하는 서명된 진술서를 첨부해야 합니다. 이 진술서에는 반드시 각 배우자의 이름, 주소, TIN을 포함해야 합니다. (한 명의 배우자가 사망한다면, 사망한 배우자를 대신해 철회한 사람의 이름과 주소를 포함합니다.) 이 진술서에는 배우자 한 명이라도 거주하거나 또는 소득을 얻는 부동산이 위치했으며 부부 공동 재산법이 존재하는 주, 해외, 그리고 미국 영토의 목록이 포함되어야 합니다. 다음과 같은 방법으로 진술서를 제출하십시오.
    1. 선택을 철회한 배우자가 반드시 신고서를 제출해야 한다면 철회가 적용되는 첫 해의 신고서에 진술서를 첨부해야 합니다.
    2. 선택을 철회하는 배우자가 세금 신고서 제출을 할 필요가 없지만, 신고서를 제출한다면 (예를 들어, 환급을 받기 위해) 이 진술서를 신고서에 첨부하십시오.
    3. 선택을 철회한 배우자가 세금 신고서 제출을 할 필요가 없으며, 환급 청구서를 제출하지 않았다면, 마지막 공동 신고서를 제출했던 국세청 서비스 센터에 진술서를 보내야 합니다.
  2. 사망. 배우자의 사망은 배우자가 사망한 다음 해의 첫 번째 과세연도를 시작으로 이 선택을 종료시킵니다. 하지만 생존 배우자가 미국 시민이거나 거주 외국인이고 생존 배우자로서 공동 세율에 자격이 있다면, 공동 세율이 사용되는 마지막 해가 끝나기 전까지 이 선택은 종료되지 않습니다. 양쪽 배우자가 같은 과세연도에 사망했다면, 부부가 사망한 과세연도가 끝난 후 첫 번째 날에 이 선택은 종료됩니다.
  3. 법적 별거. 이혼, 별거 유지 명령 하에 법적 별거는 법적 별거가 발생한 과세연도의 시작으로 선택이 종료됩니다.
  4. 불충분한 기록. IRS는 정확한 세액을 결정하기 위해 필요한 적절한 장부, 기록 등 기타 정보를 보관하지 못했거나 이러한 기록에 충분한 접근을 제공하지 못한 과세연도에 대한 선택을 종료시킬 수 있습니다.

전체 과세연도에 미국의 비거주 외국인이며 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자라면, 특정 예외를 제외하곤 미국의 비거주 외국인에 대한 규칙에 따라 과세 됩니다. 더 자세한 내용은 5장의 [_미국령 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실질 거주자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222514 "미국령 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자")를 참고하십시오
본인이 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자으로 적격이 아닌 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 비거주 외국인이라면 비거주 외국인으로서 과세됩니다.
이전에 미국 영토 사모아와 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자였던 거주 외국인은 거주 외국인 규칙에 따라 과세됩니다.
## 2. 소득 출처
#### 소개
본인의 체류 신분을 결정한 후에는 소득의 출처를 결정해야 합니다. 이 장에서는 과세연도에 수령했을 다양한 유형의 소득의 출처를 결정합니다.
#### 주제 - 본 챕터의 내용:
  * 소득 출처 규칙 그리고
  * 공동 소득.


이 장에서는 또한 부부 공동 재산 법이 있는 나라에 거주하고 있는 기혼 개인들에 대한 특별 규칙을 논합니다.
#### 거주 외국인
거주 외국인의 소득은 일반적으로 미국 시민과 같은 방법으로 세금이 적용됩니다. 거주 외국인은 모든 이자, 배당금, 급여 및 기타 서비스에 대한 보수, 자산 대여 또는 로열티 소득 및 다른 유형의 소득들을 반드시 미국 세금 신고서에 신고해야 합니다. 미국 내외의 출처로부터 이러한 총액을 반드시 신고해야 합니다.
#### 비거주 외국인
비거주 외국인은 오직 미국내 출처 소득과 미국에서 거래 또는 사업 활동과 관련된 특정 소득에 대해서만 과세됩니다. ( [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222302 "외국인 소득의 과세 방식")을 참고).
대부분의 비거주 외국인에게 적용되는 미국 출처 소득을 결정하기 위한 일반적인 규칙은 [표 2-1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222244 "표 2-1. 비거주 외국인의 소득에 대한 출처 규칙 요약")에 나와있습니다. 다음은 일반 규칙과 이러한 규칙의 예외에 관해 논의합니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_미국 출처의 모든 항목들이 과세 대상은 아닙니다._[3장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222259 "총소득에서 제외") _을 확인하십시오._.

#### 이자 소득
일반적으로 미국 출처 이자 소득은 다음의 항목을 포함합니다.
  * 미국 거주자 또는 국내 기업의 채권, 어음 등 기타 이자부 채권.
  * 과세연도에 미국 내에서 거래 또는 사업하는 국내 또는 해외 파트너쉽 또는 외국 회사에 의해 지급되는 이자.
  * 발행시할인 (OID).
  * 주, 컬럼비아 특별구 , 또는 미국 정부로부터의 이자.


지급의 장소 및 방법은 소득 출처를 결정할 때 중요하지 않습니다.
증권 대여 거래 또는 환매 조건부 매매 거래 (sale-repurchase transaction)에서 주식 양도인에게 지급하는 대체 이자는 앙도된 주식에 대한 이자로서 같은 방식으로 지급됩니다.
**예외.**
미국 출처 이자 소득은 다음의 항목을 포함하지 않습니다. 
  1. 지급된 이자가 지급자의 이자 지급 이전 과세연도의 마감과 함께 종료된 3년 기간 지급자의 전체 총소득의 적어도 80% (0.80)와 같은 경우, 거주 외국인 또는 국내 기업에 의해 지급된 2010년 8월 10일 이전에 발급된 채권에 대한 이자.
    1. 미국 외 출처이며,
    2. 외국 또는 미국 영토에서 개인 또는 기업의 거래 또는 사업 활동에 귀속됐을 경우.
하지만 아래의 둘중 하나라도 적용된다면, 이자는 미국 출처 이자 소득으로 고려될 것입니다.
    1. 이자 수령인이 거주 외국인 또는 국내 기업과 이해관계가 있을 경우. “이해관계가 있는 사람”에 대해서는 섹션 954(d)(3)를 참고하십시오.
    2. 채권이라는 용어는 2010년 8월 9일 이후에 크게 변경됬습니다. 채권 기간의 연장은 중대한 변경으로 고려됩니다.
  2. 지불되거나 입금된 이자가 협회에 의해 공제 될수 있다면, 국내 은행의 해외 지점 또는 국내 파트너쉽의 상호 저축 은행, 협동 조합 은행, 신용 조합, 국내 건설 및 대부 조합 그리고 기타 저축 및 대출로 인증 및 감독을 받는 인증 저축 기관 또는 연방 및 주법 하에 비슷한 협회의 예금 또는 인출 가능한 계좌에 대한 국내 기업의 해외 지사 또는 국내 파트너쉽에 의해 지불된 이자. 
  3. 국내 은행의 해외 지점의 또는 국내 파트너쉽의 예금에 대한 이자, 단, 지점은 상업 은행의 경우에만.


#### 배당금
대부분의 경우, 국내 기업으로부터 받은 배당금 소득은 미국 출처 소득입니다. 외국 회사로부터 배당금 소득은 보통 외국 출처의 소득입니다. 두 번째 규칙에 대한 예외는 나중에 논의합니다.
증권 대여 거래 또는 환매 조건부 매매 거래에서 주식 양도인에게 지급하는 대체 배당금은 앙도된 주식에 대한 배당금과 같은 방식으로 출처를 정합니다.
_**예외.**_
배당금 공표 이전에 과세연도 종료와 함께 끝이난 3년 동안 회사의 전체 총 수입의 25%이상이 국내 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결되어 있다면 외국 회사에서 지급된 배당금의 일부는 미국 출처입니다. 법인이 배당금 공표 전 3년 미만 전에 설립되었다면, 법인이 설립되었던 시점부터 전체 총 소득을 사용합니다. 다음 분수에 배당금을 곱하여 미국 출처 소득 부분을 결정합니다. 
| 3년간 미국내 거래 또는 사업과 연관된 외국 회사의 총 소득 |   
---|---|---  
| 해당 기간동안 모든 출처의 외국 회사의 총 소득 |   
**배당 동등 지급금.**
미국 출처 배당금에는 배당 동등 지급금 또한 포함됩니다. 배당 동등 지급금에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
  * 증권 대여 거래, 환매 조건부 매매거래, 또는 그에 상당하는 비슷한 거래에 따라 지급되는 대체 배당금,
  * 미국 출처를 언급한 명시된 명목 원금 계약 (NPC)에 따른 지급금 , 또는 
  * 미국 출처를 언급한 명시된 주식 연계 상품 (ELI)에 따라 지급금.


납세자가 계약 상 매수자인 경우 미국 출처 배당이라고 언급된 그리고 계약 하에 납세자로부터 또는 납세자에게 양도된 순 액수를 산정하기 위해 사용되었던 총소득이 배당 동등 지급금 지급금에 포함됩니다. 결과적으로, 납세자가 순 수당을 지급했거나 총액이 0이어서 지급받은 것이 없다고 하더라도 납세자는 배당 동등 지급금을 받은 것으로 간주됩니다.
2024년에는, 계약이 델타원 거래인 경우, NPC 또는 ELI는 일반적으로 각각 명시된 NPC 또는 명시된 ELI입니다. 일반적으로 델타는 계약에서 언급한 주식의 배당 수의 공정 시장 가격에서 작은 변화에 대한 NPC 또는 CLI의 공정 시작 가격에 변화의 비율입니다. 일반적으로 명시된 NPC 또는 명시된 ELI에 대한 간주 배당의 총액은 주당 배당액 계약에 언급된 주식 배당의 수를 곱하고 예약의 델타를 곱한 값이 됩니다. 특별 규칙은 복잡한 계약에 적용합니다. 추가적인 정보는 규제 조항 1.871-15와 공지 2024–44(혹은 이의 후속)을 참고하십시오.
#### 채무 보증
2010년 9월 27일 이후에 발행된 채무 보증 조항에 따라 아래로 부터 직접적으로 또는 간접적으로 받은 액수는 미국 출처 소득입니다.
  1. 비법인 거주자 또는 미국 법인, 또는
  2. 금액이 미국내 거래 또는 사업 시행과 실질적으로 연결되었다면 모든 외국인.


더 자세한 정보는 섹션 861(a)(9)를 참고하십시오. 
#### 개인 서비스
미국에서 수행한 서비스에 대한 모든 급여 및 기타 수당은 미국 출처로 간주합니다. 이 규칙에 유일한 예외는 [_외국인, 해외 단체 또는 해외 사무실의 직원_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222278 "외국인, 해외 단체, 또는 해외 사무실의 직원.")에서 이후에 논의할 것이고 [_선원_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222135 "선원.")에서 이전에 논의되었습니다.
직원이며 미국 안팎에서 수행한 노동 또는 개인 서비스에 대한 급여를 받는다면, 급여의 출처를 결정하는 데에는 특별한 규칙이 적용됩니다. 급여 (특정 복리후생 외)는 시간 기준에 따라 지급됩니다. 특정 복리후생은 (숙소 및 교육 등) 지리적 기준 출처입니다.
또는 급여의 출처를 결정하기 위해 대체 기준을 사용하도록 허락될 수 있습니다. 이후에 [_대체 기준_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222232 "대체 기준")을 참고하십시오.
**다단계 마케팅.**
하위 유통업자를 후원한 상위 유통업자와 같이, 다단계 마케팅 계약을 통해 제품을 판매하는 특정 회사들은 하위 유통업자의 특정 활동을 기준으로 돈을 받을 자격이 있습니다. 일반적으로, 사실에 따라, 이러한 다단계 마케팅 회사가 독립 (직원이 아닌) 유통업자 (상위 유통업자) 에게, 후원한 사람 (하위 유통업자) 의 판매 또는 구매를 기준으로 받은 돈은 하위 유통업자를 모집, 교육 및 지원하는 개인 서비스 수행에 대한 소득으로 간주합니다. 소득의 원천은 일반적으로 상위 유통업자의 서비스 수행 지역을 기준으로 하며, 사실에 따라 다년 보수로 간주될 수 있으며, 해당 보수가 귀속되는 기간에 따라 소득의 원천이 결정됩니다.
**자영업 개인.**
자영업자인 경우, 귀하의 특정 사례의 사실과 상황에 따라 해당 소득의 적절한 출처를 가장 정확하게 반영하는 기준을 통해 자영업으로 인한 노동 또는 개인 서비스에 대한 보수의 출처를 결정합니다. 대부분의 경우, 다음 설명과 같이 사실과 정황에 따라 시간 기준 배분이 요구됩니다.
#### 시간 기준
시간 기준을 사용하여 미국 출처 보수를 (복리후생이 아닌 [_지리적 기준_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222225 "지리적 기준")에서 설명됨) 산정합니다. 납세자의 총 급여에 다음의 분수를 곱하여 (지리적 기준에 의해 지급된 복리후생이 아닌) 그 값을 산정합니다.
| 해당 연도에 미국에서 본인이 수행한 서비스의 일 수 |   
---|---|---  
| 해당 연도에 본인이 수행한 서비스의 총 일 수 |   
위의 분수에서 해당하는 경우 일 수 보다 적은 시간 단위를 사용할 수 있습니다. 지급된 보수에 대한 시간 기간은 반드시 1년이어야 할 필요는 없습니다. 다른 기간 보다 더 적절하다고 IRS에 충족스럽게 성립할 수 있다면, 대신 다른 분명하고, 개별적이며 지속적인 기간을 사용할 수 있습니다.
**예시 1.**
크리스티나 브룩은 네덜란드 거주자로서 현 과세연도에 미국 회사에서 240일을 일했습니다. 크리스티나는 보수로 $80,000을 받았습니다. 이 보수에는 복리후생이 전혀 포함되지 않았습니다. 크리스티나는 미국에서 60일간 일했고 네덜란드에서 180일 일했습니다. 보수의 출처를 결정하기 위해 시간 기준을 사용하면 $20,000 ($80,000 x 60/240)가 크리스티나의 미국 출처 소득입니다.
**예시 2.**
랍 워터스는 남 아프리카 거주자이고 어느 한 법인에 의해 고용되었습니다. 랍의 연봉은 $100,000입니다. 이 보수에는 복리후생이 전혀 포함되지 않았습니다. 랍은 그 해의 일분기에 전체를 미국에서 일했습니다. 롭은 4월 1일에 싱가폴로 발령이 나서 연말까지 일했습니다. 그 해의 일분기와 그 해의 나머지 세 분기는 개별적이고, 분명하고 지속적인 시간의 두 개의 기간이라는 것을 롭은 성립할 수 있습니다. 따라서 롭의 연봉의 $25,000 (0.25 × $100,000)는 그 해의 일분기에 귀속됩니다. 해당 분기 전체에 미국에서 일했기 때문에 이 전부가 미국 출처 소득입니다. 나머지 $75,000은 그 해의 세 분기에 귀속됩니다. 그 분기들 동안, 랍은 싱가폴에서 150일 일하고 미국에서 30일 일했습니다. 랍은 정기적으로 미국에서 서비스를 수행했으며 그것이 명확하고 개별적이며 지속적인 기간이 성립되지 않았습니다. $75,000 중에서, $12,500 ($75,000 × 30/180)가 미국 출처 소득입니다.
**다년도 보수.**
다년도 보수의 출처는 일반적으로 시간 기준으로 보수가 귀속된 기간에 따라 결정됩니다. 다년도 보수는 한 과세연도에 귀하의 소득에 포함되지만 2년 이상의 과세연도를 포함하는 기간에 귀속되는 보수입니다.
사실과 정황에 따라 보수가 귀속된 기간을 결정합니다. 예를 들어, 다수의 과세연도를 포함하는 기간과 구체적으로 연관된 보수 금액은 다년 기간의 전체에 귀속됩니다.
미국 출처로부터의 소득으로 취급된 급여의 총액은 총 다년도 급여를 분수로 곱하여 산정합니다. 분수의 분자는 납세자가 미국에서 해당 프로젝트와 연관되어 노동 또는 개인 서비스를 제공했던 일 수 (또는 해당한다면 하루 보다 적은 시간 단위)입니다. 분수의 분모는 귀하가 해당 프로젝트와 연관되어 노동 또는 개인 서비스를 제공했던 일 수 (또는 해당한다면 하루 보다 적은 시간 단위)입니다.
#### 지리적 기준
다음의 복리후생의 형태로 본인이 직원으로서 받은 보수는 지리적 기준으로 출처가 정해집니다.
  * 숙소.
  * 교육.
  * 지역 교통비.
  * 세금 변제.
  * 규제 섹션1.861-4(b)(2)(ii)(D)(5)에 설명하고 있는 위험, 또는 고난도 임무 수당.
  * 이사 비용 변제.


복리후생의 총액은 반드시 합당해야하며, 충분한 기록물과 충분한 증거들로 반드시 증명해야 합니다. 
**주요 작업장**
세금 변제와 위험 및 고난도 임무 수당을 제외한 위의 복리후생은 귀하의 주요 작업장에 기초하여 출처를 파악합니다. 귀하의 주요 작업장은 보통 일하는 시간의 대부분을 보내는 장소입니다. 이는 귀하의 사무실, 공장, 가게, 영업점 등 위치일 수 있습니다. 만약 대부분의 작업 시간을 보낸 곳이 한 장소가 아니라면 주요 작업장은 작업에 대해 보고하는 장소 또는 작업의 “기준”이 되어야 하는 장소 등이 주요 작업장이 됩니다.
어느 시점에하도 하나 이상의 직업을 갖고 있다면, 주요 작업장은 각각의 경우에 대한 사실에 기반합니다. 고려되는 가장 중요한 요인들은 다음과 같습니다.
  * 납세자가 각 장소에서 보낸 총 시간,
  * 각 장소에서 일한 작업의 양, 그리고
  * 각 장소에서 벌어들인 돈.


**숙소.**
숙소 혜택의 출처는 귀하의 주요 작업장에 기초하여 결정됩니다. 숙소 혜택은 귀하 또는 귀하를 대신해 지불한 (그리고 가족이 함께 살고 있다면 귀하의 가족) 아래의 지급금을 포함합니다.
  * 임대료.
  * 공과금 (전화 요금 제외).
  * 부동산 및 개인 자산 보험.
  * 섹션 164 또는 216(a)하의 공제 불가 숙박세.
  * 임차권을 보증하는 환급 불가 수수료.
  * 가구와 부대용품 대여비.
  * 집 수리 비용.
  * 거주자 주차 비용.
  * 귀하의 고용주가 현물로 제공한 숙소의 공정 임대 가격.


숙소 혜택에는 다음이 포함되지 않습니다:
  * 공제 가능 이자와 세금 (조합 주택 회사에서 세입자-주주의 공제 가능한 이자와 세금 포함),
  * 주택 담보 대출 원금의 납부를 포함한 자산 구입 비용,
  * 가사 노동 비용 (가정부, 정원사, 등),
  * TV 수신료,
  * 자산의 가격 상승 또는 자산의 사용 기간을 상당히 연장하는 개보수 또는 기타 비용,
  * 가구 또는 부가 시설의 구입,
  * 자산의 감가상각, 또는 개보수,
  * 총소득에서 제외한 식사 및 임시 숙소의 가격, 또는
  * 이사 비용으로 공제한 식사 및 임시 숙소 가격.


이사 비용 공제는 현역 미군 소속이며 근무 기지 영구 변동에 의한 이사인 경우에만 대상이 됩니다.
**교육.**
귀하의 부양가족의 교육 비용에 대한 교육 혜택의 출처는 귀하의 주요 작업장의 위치에 기초하여 결정됩니다. 교육 부가 헤택에는 초등 또는 중등 학교에서의 교육에 대한 다음 비용의 경우에만 급여에 포함됩니다.
  * 수업, 수수료, 학원 과외, 특수 아동을 위한 특수 아동 서비스, 책, 저장품, 등 기타 장비.
  * 등록 및 출석과 관련된 학교에서 요구되거나 제공되는 방, 기숙사, 유니폼.


**지역 교통비.**
지역 교통비 부가 혜택의 출처는 귀하의 주요 작업장에 기초하여 결정됩니다. 지역 교통비 부가 혜택은 귀하의 기준 작업 위치에서 귀하, 귀하의 배우자, 귀하의 부양가족을 위한 지역 교통을 위한 수당으로 받은 총액입니다. 지역 교통비 부가 혜택으로 총액은 지역 교통을 위해 발생한 실제 경비 그리고 고용주가 제공한 귀하, 귀하의 배우자, 또는 부양가족이 대부분 지역 교통에 대해 사용하는 차량의 공정 대여 가격으로 제한됩니다. 실제 경비에는 귀하 또는 귀하를 위해 구입한 어떤 차량의 비용 (이자를 포함하여)을 포함하지 않습니다.
**세금 변제.**
세금 변제 부가혜택의 출처는 귀하가 변제 받은 세금을 부과한 관할 구역의 위치에 기초하여 결정됩니다.
**이사 비용 변제.**
이사 비용 변제의 출처는 일반적으로 귀하의 새로운 주요 작업장에 기초합니다. 하지만, 귀하의 상황의 사실과 정황에 더 적절하다는 충분한 증거를 제공한다면 귀하의 이전 주요 작업장의 위치에 기준하여 이 출처를 결정합니다. 충분한 증거란 일반적으로 귀하와 고용주 사이에 계약서, 또는 회사 정책의 서면 증명으로 이사 전에 쓰여진 글이 되며 귀하 또는 다른 직원들에게 다른 국가로 이사를 가도록 설득이 시작되는 시기에 증명서입니다. 서면 증명서 또는 계약서는 반드시 해당 지역으로 돌아간 후에 고용주를 위해서 계속 일하는 지 여부와 상관 없이 귀하의 이전 주요 작업장으로 돌아가기 위해 귀하에게 발생한 이사 비용에 대해 고용주가 변제할 것이라는 진술이 있어야 합니다. 여기에는 특정 상황이 포함됩니다. 즉, 이 상황에서 조건들로 인해 분명히 확인할 수 있는 기준이 제시되고 이 조건들이 이전 주요 작업장으로 되돌아간 이사의 이전이나 완결되기 까지만 시행 될 수 있는 한 변제 권리는 결정됩니다.
#### 대체 기준
귀하가 직원이라면, 사실과 정황에 따라 시간 또는 지리적 기준보다 귀하 급여의 출처를 더 적절하게 결정할 수 있다는 점을 IRS에게 충족스럽게 성립할 수 있다면 대체 기준에 따라 보수의 출처를 결정할 수 있습니다. 대체 기준을 사용하면, 반드시 대체 기준이 귀하의 소득 출처를 결정하는 데 더 적절한 사유를 설명하는 문서화된 (그리고 조사가 가능한) 기록을 보관해야 합니다. 또한 모든 출처로부터 귀하의 모든 급여가 $250,000 이상이면 스케줄 OI (양식 1040-NR)의 라인 K의 두 질문 모두에 “‘Yes’” (예)를 체크하고 서면으로 된 다음의 모든 것이 담긴 진술서를 귀하의 세금 신고서에 첨부하십시오.
  1. 귀하의 이름과 SSN (진술서의 상단에 쓰여진).
  2. 귀하가 대체 기준을 사용하려고 하는 구체적인 급여 소득 또는 구체적인 복리후생
  3. (2)에 각 항목에 대해, 사용된 출처의 할당의 대체 기준.
  4. (2)에 각 항목에 대해, 대체 할당이 산정된 방법.
  5. 대체 기준과 앞서 말한 시간 또는 지리적 기준 모두에 의해서 출처가 결정된 미국 급여와 외국 급여의 달러 액수의 비교.


#### 수송 소득
수송 소득은 선박이나 항공의 사용 또는 이의 사용과 직접 관계된 서비스의 수행에 대한 소득입니다. 이는 선박이나 항공기의 소유, 고용 또는 임대 여부에 관계없이 해당됩니다. “선박 또는 항공”이라는 용어는 선박이나 항공과 관련되어 사용된 컨테이너를 포함합니다.
미국에서 시작하고 끝난 모든 수송으로부터의 소득은 미국 출처에서 발생한 것으로 간주합니다. 만약 수송이 미국에서 시작되거나 끝이 났다면, 수송 소득의 50%는 미국 출처에서 발생한 것으로 간주합니다.
미국과 미국 영토 사이의 수송이었다면, 개인적인 서비스로부터 수송 소득에 대해 소득의 50%는 미국 출처 소득입니다. 비거주 외국인의 경우, 비행기에서 발생했거나 연관된 소득에만 적용됩니다.
미국 출처 수송 소득에 세금이 부과되는 방식에 대한 더 많은 정보는 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222302 "외국인 소득의 과세 방식")을 참고하십시오.
#### 장학금, 지원금, 상금 및 공로상금
일반적으로, 장학금, 연구 지원금, 지원금, 상금 및 상의 출처는 실제로 자금을 주었는지 여부에 상관없이 수여자의 거주지가 됩니다. 단, 이후에 [_미국 이외의 지역에서 시행한 활동_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222237 "미국 이외의 지역에서 시행한 활동.")을 참고하십시오.
예를 들어, 미국 정부, 비법인 미국 거주자, 또는 국내 법인이 미국에서 연구 또는 학업을 위해 지급된 자금은 미국 출처입니다. 외국 정부, 외국 회사로부터 비슷한 지급액을 받았다면, 그 돈이 미국 대리인을 통해 전달되었다고 하더라도 외국 출처입니다.
국제기구 면제법 하에 공공 국제 기관으로 지정된 설립체에 의해서 지급된 자금은 외국 출처입니다.
**미국 이외의 지역에서 시행한 활동.**
비거주 외국인이 받은 미국 이외의 지역에서 수행한 활동에 대한 장학금, 연구 지원금, 목표 지원금, 공로상금은 미국 출처 소득이 아닙니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이 규칙은 급여 등 서비스에 대한 보수로 받은 액수에는 적용되지 않습니다. 적용되는 출처 규칙에 대해서는 앞의_[개인 서비스](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222217 "개인 서비스") _를 참고하십시오._.
#### 연금 및 고정 지급금
미국 안팎에서 모두 수행한 서비스에 대해 국내 신탁으로부터 연금을 받는다면, 이 연금의 일부는 미국 출처입니다. 그 일부는 연금 플랜의 수익에 기인한 액수와 미국에서 시행된 서비스에 대해 고용주가 납입한 기여금입니다. 이는 인출금이 적격 또는 비적격 주식 보너스, 연금, 이익 공유 또는 고정 지급금 플랜 (자금 지원 또는 자금 미지원 여부)에서 지급되었는지 여부에 관계없이 적용됩니다.
만약 미국 정부의 직원으로서 서비스를 수행했다면, 적격 연금 플랜으로 간주되는 공무원 은퇴 시스템 (Civil Service Retirement System)처럼 미국 정부로부터 분배금을 받을 수 있습니다. 귀하의 미국 출처 소득은 귀하의 총 미국 정부 기본 수당에 귀속된 (미국 외의 지역에서 수행한 서비스에 대한 면세 수당이 아닌) 분배금의 과세 가능한 총액입니다.

#### 임대료 또는 로열티
귀하의 미국 출처 소득에는 미국에 위치한 자산 또는 자산의 지분에 대해 해당 과세연도에 받은 임대료와 로열티 소득이 포함됩니다.
미국 출처 소득은 또한 미국에서 특허, 저작권, 비밀 절차와 제조법, 영업, 상표권, 프랜차이즈 그리고 그와 유사한 자산 등 무형 자산의 사용에 대한 특권을 위한 또는 사용에 대한 대여료 또는 로열티가 포함됩니다.
#### 부동산
부동산은 땅과 건물 그리고 일반적으로 땅위에 지어진, 자라는 또는 부착된 모든것을 의미합니다.
미국의 출처로부터 총소득은 미국에 위치한 부동산의 매각 또는 기타 처분으로 인한 이득, 이익, 소득을 포함합니다.
**천연 자원.**
미국에 위치한 그리고 외국에서 판매한 또는 외국에 위치하고 미국에서 판매한 농장, 광산, 유정, 가스정, 등 천연 자원 또는 목재에서의 생산물을 판매한 소득은 부분적으로 미국 출처입니다. 그 부분을 결정하는 정보는 규정 섹션 1.863-1(b)를 참고하십시오.
#### 개인 자산
개인 자산이란 부동산이 아닌 기계, 장비 또는 가구를 의미합니다.
미국 내에 조세 거주지가 있다면, 개인 자산의 판매 또는 교환에 대한 이득과 손실은 일반적으로 미국 출처가 됩니다. 미국에 조세 거주지가 없다면, 개인 자산의 판매 또는 교환에 대한 이득과 손실은 일반적으로 미국 외의 지역 출처로 간주합니다.
**조세 거주지.**
귀하의 조세 거주지는 가족이 사는 집을 유지하는 곳과 상관없이 귀하의 사업, 고용, 또는 임무수행지가 있는 주요 장소가 있는 일반적인 지역입니다. 조세 거주지는 영구적으로 또는 무기한으로 직원 또는 자영업 개인으로 일하는 장소입니다. 직업의 특성으로 인해 사업의 정기적인 또는 주요 장소를 갖고 있지 않다면, 조세 거주지는 귀하가 정기적으로 살고 있는 장소가 됩니다. 이 범주의 어느 쪽에도 적합하지 않다면 순회자로 보고 조세 거주지는 일하는 장소가 됩니다. 
**재고 자산.**
재고 자산은 거래에서 재고 또는 거래와 사업의 일반적인 과정에서 고객에게 판매를 위해 주요하게 소유하는 개인 자산입니다. 매입한 재고 자산의 판매에 의한 소득은 해당 자산이 판매는 장소를 출처로 합니다. 일반적으로 이는 자산에 대한 소유권이 구매자에게 전달되는 곳입니다. 예를 들면, 미국내에서 재고 자산 판매로 얻은 소득은 이 재고 자산을 미국에서 구입했든 외국에서 구입했든 상관없이 미국 출처 소득입니다. 
미국에서 생산하고 미국 외의 지역에서 판매한 재고 자산의 판매로부터 소득 (또는 그 반대)은 그 자산이 생산된 곳을 출처로 합니다. 
이 규칙은 조세 거주지가 미국이 아니라고 하더라도 적용됩니다. 
**감가상각 가능 자산.**
감가상각 가능 개인 자산의 매각으로부터 얻은 이득의 출처를 결정하기 위해, 자산에 대한 총 감가상각 조정치를 초과하지 않은 소득의 부분을 우선 산정해야만 합니다. 총 감가상각 조정치 대비 미국 감가상각 조정치 비율에 기초한 소득의 일부를 미국 출처에 할당합니다. 이득의 일부의 나머지는 미국 외의 지역의 출처에 귀속된 것으로 고려합니다. 
이 목적 상 “미국 감가상각 조정치 ”는 미국 출처 과세 소득을 산정할 때 사용되는 자산의 기초에 대한 허용된 감가상각 조정치입니다. 하지만, 해당 과세연도 동안에 이 자산이 주요적으로 미국에서 사용된다면, 해당 해의 허용된 감가상각 공제 금액은 미국 감가상각 조정치로 간주합니다. 하지만 국제적으로 사용되는 특정 수송, 송신, 그리고 기타 자산에 대한 일부 예외가 있습니다. 
자산의 총 감가상각 조정치를 초과하는 감가상각 가능 자산 판매의 이득은 마치 이 자산이 위에서 언급한 [재고 자산](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222249 "재고 자산.")인것 처럼 출처가 결정됩니다.
손실은 감가상각 공제의 출처를 결정한 것과 같은 방식으로 출처를 정합니다. 단, 자산이 주요적으로 미국에서 사용된다면, 이에 대한 전체 손실은 미국 출처 소득을 감소시킵니다. 
보통, 자산의 기초가액은 자산의 취득 비용 (자금 더하기 다른 자산 또는 서비스의 공정 시장 가격)을 의미합니다. 감가상각은 거래 또는 사업 자산의 비용 또는 다른 기초가액을 회복하기 위한 공제액입니다. 자산의 비용, 자산 사용 시기, 비용을 회복 기간 그리고 감가상각 사용방식에 따라 공제할 수 있는 금액이 달라집니다. 감가상각 공제는 자본 비용을 공제가능 비용으로 간주하는 감가상각 또는 감각상각에 대한 공제 또는 다른 허용되는 공제입니다. 
**무형 자산.**
무형 자산에는 특허, 저작권, 비밀 기법 및 가공법, 영업권, 상표권, 상호, 또는 다른 비슷한 자산들이 포함됩니다. 감채 또는 감가상각 가능 무형 자산의 매매 이득은 이전의 허용 감채 또는 감가상각 공제 금액까지는 본래 공제의 출처를 정한 같은 방식으로 출처를 정합니다. 이는 감가상각 가능 자산 매매의 이득에 대한 출처 규칙과 동일합니다. 규칙 적용 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 이전의 [_감가상각 가능 자산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222250 "감가상각 가능 자산.")을 참고하십시오.
매매에 대한 소득이 자산의 생산성, 용도, 또는 처분 여하를 따른다면, 감채 또는 감가상각 공제 초과 이득의 출처는 자산이 사용된 국가입니다. 소득이 해당 자산의 생산성, 용도, 처분 여하를 따르지 않는다면, 해당 소득은 귀하의 조세 거주지에 따라 (앞서 말한 것과 같이) 결정됩니다. 영업권에 대한 지불금이 생산성, 사용, 처분에 의존하지 않는다면, 이 출처는 영업권이 발생된 국가입니다.
**사무실 또는 고정된 사업 장소를 통한 판매.**
이전의 규칙에도 불구하고, 미국 내에 조세 거주지를 갖고 있지 않지만 사무실, 또는 다른 고정된 사업 장소를 미국 내에 유지하고 있다면, 개인 자산의 매각으로부터 얻은 소득은 (재고자산 포함) 사무실과 고정된 사업 장소에 귀속된 미국 소득으로 간주합니다. 하지만, 실질적으로 판매에 참여한 사무실 또는 다른 고정된 사업 장소가 미국 외의 지역에 위치해 있다면, 이 규칙은 미국 외의 지역에 사용, 처분 또는 소비를 위한 재고 자산의 매각에 적용되지 않습니다. 
미국에 조세 거주지가 있지만 미국외의 지역에 사무실, 또는 그밖의 고정된 사업 장소를 유지하고 있다면, 외국의 사무실과 고정된 사업 장소에 귀속된 재고, 감가상각 자산, 또는 무형 자산이 아닌 개인 자산의 매각로부터 얻은 소득은 미국 소득으로 간주합니다. 만약 매각 소득의 10%보다 낮은 소득세가 외국에 납부된다면 이 소득은 미국 출처소득으로 간주합니다. 해외 국가가 이득으로 이어진 판매에 10% 미만의 소득세를 부과했다면 이 규칙은 또한 손실에도 적용됩니다. 
#### 공동 소득
귀하가 기혼이며 본인 또는 본인의 배우자가 외국, 미국, 또는 미국 영토의 공동 재산 법에 적용을 받는다면, 귀하는 반드시 본인과 본인의 배우자의 미국 세금 목적의 소득을 결정하기 위해 해당 법을 따라야만합니다. 하지만, 다음의 경우에는 반드시 특정 공동 재산 법을 무시해야 합니다.
  * 귀하와 귀하의 배우자가 둘다 모두 비거주 외국인 이거나, 또는
  * 앞서 설명한 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")에서 처럼 둘 중의 한 명이 비거주 외국인이고 다른 사람이 미국 시민 또는 거주자이며 두 사람 모두 미국 거주자로서 간주되기를 원치 않는다고 선택한 경우.


이러한 경우에, 귀하와 귀하의의 배우자는 반드시 부부 공동 소득을 신고해야 합니다. 이는 나중에 설명합니다. 
**근로 소득.**
거래 또는 사업 소득 또는 파트너쉽 소득에 대한 파트너의 지분 외에 배우자의 근로 소득은 배우자의 서비스가 소득을 발생 시킨 배우자의 소득으로 취급됩니다. 이 배우자는 반드시 본인의 개별 신고서에 전부 신고해야 합니다. 
**거래 또는 사업 소득.**
파트너쉽 소득에 대한 파트너의 지분이 아닌 거래 또는 사업 소득은 배우자가 거래 또는 사업을 수행한 소득으로 취급합니다. 이 배우자는 반드시 본인의 개별 신고서에 모두 신고해야 합니다. 
**파트너쉽 소득 (또는 손실).**
파트너쉽 소득 (또는 손실)에 대한 파트너의 지분은 파트너의 소득 (또는 손실)으로 취급됩니다. 이 파트너는 반드시 본인의 개별 신고서에 모두 신고해야 합니다. 
**개별 자산 소득.**
한 쪽 배우자로부터의 개별 자산소득 (근로소득, 거래 또는 사업 소득, 또는 파트너쉽 지분 소득이 아님)은 해당 배우자의 소득으로 취급됩니다. 이 배우자는 반드시 본인의 개별 신고서에 모두 신고해야 합니다. 적절한 부부 공동 재산 법을 사용하여 별도 자산이 어떤 것인지 판단하십시오. 
**기타 공동 소득.**
그외 다른 모든 공동 소득은 해당되는 공동 자산 법에 의해 취급됩니다. 
## 3. 총소득에서 제외

**포트폴리오 이자.**
포트폴리오 이자에 적격인 이자와 OID는 섹션 1441~1443 의거한 챕터 3 (국세법의) 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다. 하지만 이자가 원천징수 가능 지급금이며 섹션 1471~1474에 의거 원천징수하는 챕터 4 (국세법)에 대한 예외가 없을 경우 해당 이자에 원천징수가 적용될 수 있습니다. 자세한 정보는 [간행물 515(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-515)에서 _특정 소득에 원천징수_ 에 따른 포트폴리오 이자에 관한 논의를 참고하십시오. 
포트폴리오 이자에 적격이기 위해서, 반드시 1984년 7월 18일 이후에 발행된 채권에 대한 지불된 이자여야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 2012년 3월 18일 이후에 발행된 채권에 대해, 등록 양식에 없는 채무에 지불된 이자는 포트폴리오 이자에 포함하지 않습니다. 2012년 3월 19일 이전에는 채권이 아래 설명하는 요건을 충족한다면 포트폴리오 이자에 등록된 채권과 미등록 특정 (무기명) 채권이 포함됐었습니다.

####  외국 고용주를 위해 일함
외국 고용주에게 급여를 받았다면, 귀하의 미국 출처 소득은 미국 세금에서 제외될 수 있지만 오직 다음에서 논하는 상황 중 하나에 충족하는 경우에 한합니다.
**외국인, 해외 단체, 또는 해외 사무실의 직원.**
아래의 세 가지 조건을 모두 충족한다면 미국에서 비거주 외국인으로서 수행한 서비스에 대한 소득은 미국 출처 소득으로 고려하지 않으며 세금에서 제외됩니다.

  2. 해당 과세연도 동안에 총 90일이 넘지 않는 한 번의 기간 또는 여러번의 기간에 귀하가 비거주 외국인으로 미국에 일시적을 체류하는 동안 서비스를 수행함.
  3. 이러한 서비스에 대한 귀하의 급여는 $3,000을 넘지 않음.


만약 모든 세 개의 조건을 충족하지 않는다면, 귀하가 미국에서 개인 서비스의 시행으로부터 얻은 소득은 미국 출처 소득이며 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222302 "외국인 소득의 과세 방식")에서의 규칙에 따라 과세됩니다. 
이러한 서비스에 대한 귀하의 급여가 $3,000 이상이면, 총 액수가 미국 내에 거래 또는 사업으로부터의 소득입니다. 귀하의 급여가 $3,000을 넘는지 알아보기 위해, 귀하가 고용주으로부터 받은 선불 또는 변제 금액에 대한 설명이 요구되며, 이에 대한 설명을 했다면 해당 비용을 포함하지 마십시오. 선불이나 변제가 귀하의 비용보다 많다면, 이 서비스에 대한 급여에 초과액을 포함하십시오. 
“하루”는 미국에 실질적으로 제류한 어느 기간의 1일을 의미합니다. 
**예시 1.**
비협정 국가 출신 비거주 외국인인 헨리 스미스는 2024년에 미국 파트너쉽의 해외 사무실에서 일했습니다. 헨리는 본인의 과세연도로 역년을 사용합니다. 2024년도에 파트너쉽의 해외 사무소에 개인 서비스를 시행하기 위해 60일동안 미국에서 임시로 체류했습니다. 서비스에 대한 보상으로 이 사무실은 헨리에게 총 급여로 $2,800을 지급했습니다. 2024년 동안 헨리는 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않았습니다. 해당 급여는 미국 출처 소득으로 고려되지 않습니다. 그리고 미국 세금에서 제외됩니다.
**예시 2.**
헨리가 미국에서 2024년에 수행한 서비스에 대한 총 급여가 $4,500인 것만 제외하면 상황은 _예시 1_ 과 똑같습니다. 그는 2024년에 $2,875 그리고 2025년에 $1,625를 받았습니다. 2024년 동안, 헨리는 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사했습니다. 왜냐하면 헨리의 개인 서비스에 대한 보수가 $3,000을 초과하기 때문입니다. 헨리의 급여는 미국 출처 소득이며 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222713 "조세협정 혜택")에서의 규칙에 따라 과세됩니다. 
**선원.**

**학생 및 교환 방문객.**
미국에서 “F,” “J,” “M,” 또는 “Q” 비자로 체류한 비거주 외국인 학생과 교환 방문객은 외국 고용주으로부터 받은 총소득 급여를 제외할 수 있습니다. 
이 그룹에는 실제 학생, 학자, 훈련생, 교사, 교수, 연구 조교, 전문가, 또는 전문 지식 또는 기술 분야에 선도자 또는 유사한 부류의 사람들이 포함됩니다. 해당 외국인과 함께 왔거나 이후에 함께 한 해당 외국인의 배우자 그리고 미성년 자녀들도 또한 포함됩니다. 
비거주 외국인은 “J” 비자로 미국에 임시 체류했으며 1961년 상호 교육 및 문화 교류 법에 의해 미국에 교환 방문객으로 입국한 외국인 개인을 포함합니다. 
_**외국 고용주.**_

  * 외국 또는 미국 영토에서 미국 회사, 미국 파트너쉽 또는 미국인 또는 미국 외국인 개인에 의해 관리되는 사무실 또는 사업 장소.


용어, “외국 고용주”는 외국 정부를 포함하지 않습니다. 외국 정부로부터 받은 미국 소득세 면제인 급여는 [10장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222746 "외국 정부 및 국제기구의 직원")에서 논합니다.

**협정에 영향을 받은 소득.**
미국이 당사자인 협정하에 미국세금으로부터 제외가 되는 모든 유형의 소득은 납세자의 총소득으로부터 제외됩니다. 그러나 협정으로만 제한되는 세금에 대한 소득은 총 소득에 포함됩니다. [9장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222713 "조세협정 혜택")을 참고하십시오. 
#### 개 또는 말의 경주에서 받은 도박 상금

.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_귀하에게_[4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222302 "외국인 소득의 과세 방식") _에서 논의한 국적포기세 규칙이 적용이 된다면 이 제외사항은 적용되지 않습니다._.
#### 장학금 및 연구 지원금
학위 예정자라면, 적격 장학금으로 받은 일부 또는 모든 금액을 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 여기에서 논하는 규칙들은 거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인 모두에게 적용됩니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_비거주 외국인이 미국 출처가 아닌 지원금을 받았다면, 미국 세금이 적용되지 않습니다. 2장에서_[장학금, 지원금, 상금 및 공로상금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222235 "장학금, 지원금, 상금 및 공로상금") _을 참고하여 미국 출처로부터 지원금을 받은 것인지 여부를 판단하십시오._.
장학금 또는 연구비는 다음의 경우에만 소득에서 제외됩니다.
  1. 귀하가 적격 교육 기관에 학위 예정자일 경우, 그리고
  2. 귀하가 장학금 및 연구비를 사용하여 적격 교육 비용을 지불했을 경우.


**학위 예정자.**
다음의 경우 납세자가 학위 예정자입니다. 
  1. 초등, 중고등 학교에 다니거나 대학 및 종합 대학에서 학위를 받으려고 하는 경우, 또는
  2. 아래를 제공하도록 허가를 받은 교육 기관에 다니는 경우.
    1. 학사 학위 또는 그 이상에 대한 총 학점이 인정된 프로그램, 또는
    2. 인정 받은 직업에 이득이 되는 고용을 위해 학생을 준비시키기 위한 훈련 프로그램.


**적격 교육 기관.**
적격 교육 기관은 정규 교직원과, 커리큘럼을 관리하며 교육적 활동을 지속하는 장소에 참석 및 정기적으로 등교하는 학생들이 있는 장소입니다. 
**적격 교육 비용.**
이러한 비용에는,
  * 적격 교육 기관에 등록하거나 다니기 위해 요구되는 수업료와 각종 비용, 그리고
  * 적격 교육 기관에서 과정을 위해 요구되는 수업료, 책, 준비물, 도구 등 학업 관련 비용이 포함됩니다. 이런 항목들은 반드시 귀하의 수업 과정 도중 모든 학생들에게 요구되어야 합니다.


하지만, 이러한 항목들이 적격 교육 비용이 되기 위해서 장학금, 또는 지원금의 조건은 예를 들어 방 또는 기숙사처럼 다른 목적을 위해서 사용하도록 요구할 수 없거나 혹은 학비 또는 수업 관련 비용을 위해 사용될 수 없다고 규정할 수 없습니다. 
_**적격하지 않은 비용.**_
적격 교육 비용은 다음과 같은 비용을 포함하지 않습니다.
  * 방과 기숙사,
  * 여행,
  * 연구,
  * 사무적인 도움, 또는
  * 적격 교육 기관에서 등록 또는 출석을 위해 필수적이지 않은 도구 및 비용.


수수료가 등록 및 출석의 조건으로 기관에 지불되어야 한다고 하더라도 마찬가지 입니다. 이러한 비용을 지불하기 위해 사용한 장학금 또는 지원금은 과세 대상입니다.
**적격하지 않은 비용 지불 금액.**
해당 비용이 등록 및 출석 조건으로 교육 기관에 내야만 하는 비용이라고 하더라도 적격이 아닌 비용을 내기 위해 사용되는 장학금은 과세 대상입니다.
**서비스에 대한 급여.**
과거, 현재, 미래 교육 연구, 또는 다른 서비스의 대가로 받은 장학금, 지원금, 또는 학비 감소의 부분은 소득에서 제외할 수 없습니다. 모든 학위 예정자들이 학위를 받기 위한 조건으로 이러한 서비스를 수행하도록 요구된다고 하더라도 마찬가지 입니다. 
**예.**
1월 7일 마리아 고메즈는 봄 학기에 대해 $2,500의 장학금을 받게 되었다고 통지를 받았습니다. 장학금을 받게 되는 조건으로, 마리아는 반드시 파트 타임 조교로 일을 해야 합니다. $2,500 장학금 중에, $1,000은 마리아의 조교 임무에 대한 급여입니다. 마리아가 모든 다른 조건을 충족한다고 가정할 때, 마리아는 적격 장학금으로 소득에서 $1,500 이상은 제외할 수 없습니다.
## 4. 외국인 소득의 과세 방식
#### 소개
거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인은 과세되는 방식이 다릅니다. 거주 외국인은 일반적으로 미국 시민과 똑같이 과세됩니다. 비거주 외국인은 소득의 출저 그리고 소득이 실질적으로 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업과의 관련 여부에 기초하여 과세됩니다. 아래의 논의는 과세연도에 귀하가 받은 소득이 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되었는지 그리고 어떻게 과세되는지 판명하는 것을 도울 것입니다.
#### 주제 - 본 챕터의 내용:
  * 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 소득,
  * 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결이 되지 않은 소득,
  * 거주가 중단된 기간, 그리고
  * 국적포기세.


#### 유용한 항목 - 다음을 보십시오.
**간행물**
  * 544  매각 및 기타 자산의 처분
  * 1212 발행시 할인 (OID) 상품 


**양식 (또는 지침)**
  * 6251 대체 최저세-개인
  * 스케줄 D (양식 1040) 자본 손익


이러한 간행물 및 양식을 받기 위한 정보는 [12장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100051142 "세금 관련 도움을 받는 방법")을 참고하십시오.
#### 거주 외국인
거주 외국인은 일반적으로 미국 시민과 똑같이 과세됩니다. 이는 전세계 소득이 미국 세금에 적용되며 반드시 미국 세금 신고서에 신고되어야 한다는 뜻입니다. 거주 외국인의 소득에는 미국 시민에게 적용되는 누진 세율이 적용됩니다. 거주 외국인들은 양식 1040를 위한 지침에 포함된 미국 시민에게 적용되는 세금 표와 세금 산정 작업표를 사용합니다.
#### 비거주 외국인
미국 소득세가 적용되는 비거주 외국인의 소득은 아래 두 개의 범주로 나눠집니다.
  1. 미국에서 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 소득, 그리고
  2. 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되지 않은 소득 (이후에, [_30% 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222345 "30% 세금")에서 논합니다).


이 두 개의 카테고리의 차이점은, 실질적으로 연결된 소득은 허용된 공제 후에 누진 세율로 과세됩니다. 이는 미국 시민 그리고 거주 외국인에게 똑같이 적용되는 세율입니다. 실질적으로 연결되지않은 소득은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정 세율)의 일정 세율로 과세됩니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이전에 미국 시민, 또는 거주 외국인이였다면, 이 규칙은 적용되지 않습니다. 이장의 후반에 있는_[국적포기세](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222368 "국적포기세") _를 참고하십시오._.
#### 미국내에서의 거래 또는 사업
일반적으로 그 해에 받은 소득을 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 간주하려면 귀하가 해당 과세연도에 거래 또는 사업에 종사해야만 합니다.귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하였는지 여부는 귀하의 활동 특징을 따릅니다. 다음의 논의는 본인이 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하였는지를 결정하는데 도움을 줄 것입니다.
#### 개인 서비스
만약 미국에서 과세연도에 어느 때라도 개인 서비스를 수행한다면, 귀하는 미국내에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것으로 간주됩니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_외국 고용주가 비거주 외국인에게 지불한 특정 수당은 총소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 더 자세한 사항은 3장에서_[외국 고용주를 위해 일함](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222277 " 외국 고용주를 위해 일함") _을 참고하십시오._.
#### 기타 거래 또는 사업 활동
미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 다른 예는 다음과 같습니다.
**교사 및 훈련생.**
귀하가 미국에서 비이민자 신분의 “F,” “J,” “M,” 또는 “Q” 비자로 일시적으로 체류했으며 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않은 경우, 섹션 1441(b)에 설명된 장학금 또는 연구 지원금 프로그램에 참여해 과세대상 소득이 있었다면 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것으로 간주합니다. 미국 출처 장학금 또는 연구 지원금의 과세대상 부분은 미국에서 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 취급됩니다.
### 비고.
“J” 비자로 미국에 일시적인 체류한 비거주 외국인은 1961년 제정된 상호 교육 및 문화 교류 법에 의해 미국에 교환 방문객으로 입국한 비거주 외국인 개인을 포함합니다.
**사업 운영.**
서비스, 제품 또는 상품 판매를 하는 사업을 미국에서 소유하고 운영한다면, 귀하는 미국에서 특정 예외 사항있는 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것입니다. 
**파트너쉽.**
귀하가 해당 과세연도의 언제라도 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 참여했던 파트너쉽의 일원이었다면, 귀하는 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에서 종사한 것으로 여깁니다. 
**유산 또는 신탁의 수혜자.**
귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 유산 또는 신탁의 수혜자라면, 귀하는 동일 거래 또는 사업에 종사하고 있는 것으로 간주됩니다. 
**주식, 증권, 상품 거래.**
귀하의 유일한 미국 사업 활동이 미국 거주 브로커나 대리인을 통한 주식, 증권 또는 상품 거래라면 (헤지 거래를 포함하여), 귀하는 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것이 아닙니다. 
주식, 증권 거래의 경우, 이는 주식 및 증권 딜러 또는 브로커를 포함한 비거주 외국인에게도 적용합니다. 
상품 거래의 경우, 이는 일반적으로 조직화된 상품 거래소에서 거래되는 상품과 이러한 교환소에서 발생하는 거래에 적용됩니다. 
귀하에게 현 과세연도에 미국 사무실 또는 기타 고정 사업 장소가 있었거나 또는 이의 지시에 따라 주식, 증권 또는 상품의 거래를 했다면 해당 논의는 적용되지 않습니다. 
_**비거주 외국인 본인 계정에서의 거래.**_
본인의 계좌로 주식, 증권, 상품 거래가 미국에서의 유일한 사업 활동이라면, 귀하는 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않았습니다. 이 거래가 미국에 체류하는 동안 발생했거나 귀하의 직원, 브로커, 또는 다른 대행인에 의해 이루어졌다고 해도 마찬가지로 적용됩니다. 
본인이 딜러라면 주식, 증권, 상품을 본인의 계정을 통해 거래를 한 것이라면 이는 적용되지 않습니다. 이는 귀하가 딜러라고해서 반드시 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사했다고 고려됨을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다. 위의 [_주식, 증권, 상품 거래_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222317 "주식, 증권, 상품 거래.")에서 주어진 규칙에 따라 각각의 경우에 또는 사실과 상황에 기초하여 이를 결정하십시오.
#### 실질적으로 연결된 소득
미국의 거래 또는 사업에 종사하였다면, 해당 과세연도에 미국 내의 출처의 (특정 투자 소득 외에) 모든 소득, 이득, 손실은 실질적으로 연결된 소득으로 취급합니다. 이는 해당 과세연도에 소득과 미국에서 시행된 거래 또는 사업의 관련 여부에 관계없이 적용됩니다.
추후에 _[투자 소득](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222322 "투자 소득")_ 에서 설명하고 있는 두 개의 테스트는 투자 이득의 특정 항목이 (예를 들어, 이자, 배당 그리고 로열티) 해당 사업에 실질적으로 연결이 되는 것으로 취급하는지 여부를 결정합니다.
제한된 상황에서 일부 외국 출처 소득은 미국에서 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결이 되는 것으로 취급할 수 도 있습니다. 이 규칙에 대한 논의는, 이후에 [_해외 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222340 "해외 소득")을 참고하십시오.
#### 투자 소득
미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된것으로 취급될 수도 있고 그렇지 않을 수도 있는 미국 출처의 투자 소득은 일반적으로 다음 세 가지 범주로 분류됩니다.
  1. 고정적 또는 확정가능 소득 (이자, 배당, 임대, 로열티, 보험료, 연금, 등).
  2. 다음 유형의 자산의 매각 또는 교환에 대한 이득 (이중 일부는 자본 소득으로 여김).
     * 경제적 이득을 유지한 목재, 석탄, 또는 국내 철광석.
     * 1966년 10월 4일 이후에 귀하가 조건부 지급을 받은 특허, 저작권, 동류의 자산.
     * 1966년 10월 5일 전에 양도된 특허.
     * OID 채권.
  3. 자본 이익 (및 손실).


아래에서 설명하는 두가지 테스트를 사용하여 과세연도에 받은 위의 세 개의 범주에 속하는 미국 출처 소득 항목이 미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결이 있는지 결정하십시오. 소득 항목이 실질적으로 연결이 있는 것으로 테스트가 나타낸다면, 귀하는 반드시 이를 다른 실질적으로 연결된 소득과 함께 포함시켜야 합니다. 만약 소득 항목이 실질적으로 연결되지 않는다면 이 장의 뒷부분에 [_30% 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222345 "30% 세금")에서 논의한 모든 기타 소득에 포함시키십시오.
**자산 사용 테스트.**
이 테스트는 일반적으로 거래 또는 사업 활동에 의해 직접 발생한 소득이 아닌 경우에 적용됩니다. 해당 테스트 하에, 만약 소득 항목이 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에서 사용된 또는 사용을 위해 소유한 자산(재산)에서 비롯된 것이라면, 실질적으로 연결되어 있다고 고려됩니다.
다음의 경우라면, 자산이 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에서 사용되었거나 사용을 위해 보유한 것입니다. 
  * 미국에서 거래 또는 사업 시행을 권장할 기본 목적으로 보유하고 있는 경우,
  * 미국에서 시행한 거래 또는 사업 (예를 들어 거래 또는 사업에서 발생한 매출 채권 (AR), 어음)의 일반적인 과정에서 취득 및 보유한 경우, 또는
  * 미국에서 거래 또는 사업의 예측되는 미래의 필요성이 아닌 현재 필요성을 충족하기 위해 보유 중일 경우.


일반적으로 법인의 주식은 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에서 사용되거나 사용을 위해 보유한 자산으로서 취급하지 않습니다.
**사업 활동 테스트**
보통 이 테스트는 소득, 이익 또는 손실을 거래 또는 사업 활동에서 직접적으로 얻은 경우에 적용됩니다. 다음과 같은 상황에 사업 활동 테스트가 가장 중요합니다. 
  * 증권 또는 주식의 딜러가 받은 배당금 또는 이자,
  * 특허권 또는 유사 자산을 라이센싱하는 거래 및 사업을 통해 받은 로열티, 또는
  * 서비스 사업에서 얻은 서비스 수수료 수익.


이 테스트에 의하여, 만약 미국의 거래 또는 사업의 시행이 소득을 발생시킨 주요 요인이었다면, 해당 소득은 실질적으로 관련되었다고 여깁니다. 
#### 개인 서비스 소득
귀하가 미국에서 개인 서비스를 시행했을 때, 일반적으로 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것입니다. 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하여 받게되는 개인 서비스 소득은 그 과세연도에 미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결되어 있습니다. 서비스를 시행한 연도에 소득을 받았었던 이유로 실질적으로 관련될 수 있다면 서비스를 시행하지 않았던 연도에 받았던 소득 또한 실질적으로 연결되어 있습니다. 개인 서비스 소득은 급여, 연봉, 커미션, 수수료, 출장비 및 직원 경비 그리고 보너스가 포함됩니다. 이 소득은 현금, 서비스, 또는 자산의 형식으로 귀하에게 지불될 수 있습니다.
해당 과세연도 동안, 오직 미국에서 개인 서비스를 시행한 이유로 미국 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것이라면 , 자산의 소득 및 이득 그리고 자본 자산의 매각 또는 교환으로부터 얻은 이득과 손실은 일반적으로 귀하의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결되지 않습니다. 하지만, 귀하의 자산의 보유와 귀하의 개인 서비스를 시행하는 거래 또는 사업 사이에 직접적 경제 관계가 있다면, 해당 소득, 이득, 및 손실은 실질적으로 연결됩니다. 
**연금.**
미국에서 1986년 이후에 개인 서비스를 시행했으며 이후 과세연도에 비거주 외국인 신분으로 해당 서비스에 귀속된 연금 또는 퇴직금의 분배금을 받았다면, 그러한 분배금은 실질적으로 기여한 정도까지만 소득에 연결됩니다. 귀하가 연금 또는 퇴직금의 분배를 받는 해에 미국 거래 또는 사업의 종사 여부는 관계없습니다.
#### 수송 소득
[수송 소득](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222233 "수송 소득")은 (2장에서 정의된) 아래의 두 조건을 모두 충족하면 실질적으로 연결됩니다.
  1. 미국 내에 위치한 소득 창출에 연루된 고정 사업 장소를 가지고 있었을 경우.
  2. 귀하의 미국 출처 수송 소득의 최소 90%는 정기적으로 예정된 수송에 기인했을 경우.


“고정 사업 장소”는 일반적으로 거래 또는 사업을 하는데 사용하는 장소, 위치, 구조물 또는 유사 시설을 의미합니다. “정기적으로 예정된 수송” 은 선박이나 비행기가 공개된 스케줄에 따라 정기적인 기간을 두고 반복적으로 미국이 출발지 또는 도착지인 항해 또는 운항을 하는 것을 의미합니다. 이 정의는 예정된 그리고 전세 항공 수송에 모두 적용됩니다. 
위의 두 조건을 충족하지 못한다면, 소득은 실질적으로 연결되지 않으며 4% 세율로 과세됩니다. 이 장에서 후에 [_수송 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222363 "수송 세금")을 참고하십시오.
#### 사업 손익 및 판매 거래
미국에서의 사업 운영으로부터 얻은 미국 출처의 모든 손익은 실질적으로 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업과 연결됩니다. 예를 들어 미국이나 또는 외국에서 구입한 재고 자산의 미국에서의 판매 수익은 실질적으로 연결된 거래 또는 사업 소득입니다. 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 파트너쉽의 미국 출처 손익 지분 또한 미국내의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되어 있습니다.
#### 부동산 이득 또는 손실
미국의 부동산 지분의 판매 또는 교환으로부터의 이득 및 손실 (자본 자산 또는 자본 자산이 아님)은 귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것과 마찬가지로 과세됩니다. 귀하는 반드시 이득과 손실을 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 다루어야 합니다.
**미국 부동산 지분.**
이는 미국 또는 미국 영토 버진아일랜드 위치한 부동산의 지분 또는 미국 부동산 지주회사인 국내 회사의 지분 (채권자가 아닌)을 뜻합니다. 부동산에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
  1. 땅과 분리되지 않은 땅에서 나오는 작물들, 예를 들어 자라나는 곡식, 나무, 그리고 광산 유정, 등 퇴적된 천연 자원.
  2. 건물, 기타 영구적인 구조물들과 그들의 구조적 요소 등 대지의 개발.
  3. 아래의 항목을 제외한 농장, 광산, 숲 또는 공사, 등 숙박 시설에 사용되는 자산 또는 임대 사무실 공간 등 부동산의 사용과 관련된 개인 자산.
    1. 부동산의 처분 1년 전 또는 1년 후에 처분된 개인 자산
    2. 부동산의 판매자 또는 구매자와 관련되지 않은 사람에게 개별적으로 판매된 개인 자산. 


_**미국 부동산 지주 법인.**_
어느 한 법인의 미국 부동산 지분의 공정 시장 가격이 다음의 총 공정 시작 가격의 50% 이상이면 이 법인은 미국 부동산 지주 법인입니다. 
  * 법인의 미국 부동산 지분 더하기
  * 국외에 위치한 법인의 부동산 지분 더하기
  * 거래 또는 사업에 사용된 또는 사용을 위해 보유한 이 법인의 다른 자산들. 


해당 법인이 미국 부동산 지주 법인이 아니라고 확립하지 않는 이상 모든 국내 법인의 주식은 미국 부동산 지주 법인의 주식으로 취급됩니다.
_**상장 예외.**_
귀하가 해당 종류 주식의 공정 시장 가격의 5% 이상을 소유하고 있지 않다면 (또는 부동산 투자 신탁 (REIT) 의 경우에 주식의 10% 이상), 미국 부동산 지분에는 기존 주식 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 기업의 주식의 종류는 포함되지 않습니다. 이 회사가 국내 회사로서 취급되기를 선택하지 않았다면, 미국 부동산을 소유한 외국회사의 지분은 일반적으로 미국 부동산 지분이 아닙니다.
**적격 투자 설립체 (QIE).**
QIE에는 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. QIE는 미국 부동산 지주 법인 (섹션 897(h)(4)(A)(ii)에 특정 규칙 적용 후)으로 취급되는 REIT 또는 RIC입니다. 구체적인 정보는 [간행물 515(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-515)에서 _미국 부동산 지분_ 을 참고하십시오. 
_**QIE를 위한 투명성 규칙.**_
대부분의 경우에, 또는 비거주 외국인, 외국 법인, 또는 QIE의 미국 부동산 지분 판매 또는 교환으로부터 얻은 이득에 기인한 QIE에게 지급한 분배금은 해당 비거주 외국인, 외국 법인 또는 미국 부동산 지분 판매 또는 교환으로부터 얻은 QIE에 의해 인식된 이득으로 취급됩니다.
QIE에 의한 분배금에 대한 투명성 규칙에는 특정 예외가 적용됩니다. 주주가 배당 일에 끝나는 1년 동안 언제라도 주식의 5% 이하를 소유한다면 (또는 REIT의 경우에는 주식의 10% 이하) 미국의 기존 주식 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 주식에 대한 QIE의 분배금은 미국 부동산 지분의 판매 또는 교환 이득으로 취급하지 않습니다. 
REIT에 의해 지급되는 분배금은 일반적으로 만약 주주가 적격 주주라면 (섹션 897(k)(3)에 설명하는 것 처럼) 미국 부동산 지분의 판매 및 교환 소득으로 취급되지 않습니다. 
미국 부동산 지분의 판매 및 교환으로부터 이득으로 취급되지 않는 분배금은 귀하의 총소득에 일반 배당금으로 포함될 수 있습니다.
_**REIT 주식의 처분.**_
적격 주주가 직접적으로 보유한 (또는 하나 이상의 파트너쉽을 통해서 간접적으로) REIT 주식의 처분은 미국 부동산 지분으로 취급되지 않습니다. 자세한 정보는 섹션 897(k)(2) ~ (4)를 참고하십시오.
_**국내에서 규제되는 QIE.**_
국내에서 규제되는 QIE 지분의 판매는 미국 부동산 지분의 판매가 아닙니다. 테스트 기간에 외국 사람에 의해 직접 또는 간접적으로 주식의 가치의 50% 이하가 소유되었다면 이 설립체는 국내에서 규제됩니다. 테스트 기간은 다음의 기간보다 짧습니다.
  * 처분한 날짜로 부터 5년의 기간, 또는 
  * 설립체가 존재한 기간.


QIE가 국내에서 규제 받는지 여부를 결정하기 위한 목적으로, 다음과 같은 규칙이 적용됩니다.
  1. 테스팅 기간에 미국에서 기존의 주식시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 QIE의 어떤 종류의 주식이든 5% 미만을 가진 사람은 QIE가 이 사람이 미국인이 아니라는 것에 대한 실제적인 지식이 없다면, 이 사람을 미국인으로 취급하게 될 것입니다.
  2. 다음의 경우라면 다른 QIE가 보유하고 있는 QIE의 주식은 외국인이 소유된 것으로 취급될 것입니다.
    1. 해당 QIE의 그 어떤 종류의 주식이 기존의 주식 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 경우, 또는
    2. 그런 다른 QIE는 특정 상환 주식을 발행하는 RIC입니다. 
위의 내용과 관계없이 해당 QIE가 국내 규제를 받는다며면, QIE의 주식은 미국인에 의해 소유된 것으로 취급됩니다.
  3. 위에서 설명하지 않은 다른 QIE에 의해서 소유된 QIE의 주식은 미국 사람이 소유한 다른 QIE 주식 (또는 그렇게 취급되는)에 비례하여 미국 사람이 소유한 것으로 취급 될 것입니다.


_**Wash sale (워시 세일).**_
만약 국내에서 규제 되는 QIE의 지분을 워시세일이 적용되는 거래로 처분한다면, 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 워시 세일이 적용되는 거래는 다음 중 하나입니다.
  1. 미국 부동산 지분의 판매 또는 교환 이득으로 취급했을 (하지만 처분된 경우에) 분배금의 이전 배당일의 30일 기간 도중 국내 규제 QIE의 지분의 처분, 그리고 
  2. 30일 기간의 첫 번째 날부터 시작되는 61일 기간도중 해당 회사와 실질적인 동일한 지분을 취득, 또는 계약 또는 취득할 옵션을 체결할 경우. 


이러한 상황이 발생한다면, 이득으로 취급되었어야 할 분배금과 동등한 액수의 미국 부동산 지분 판매 또는 교환을 통한 이득이 귀하에게 발생한 것으로 취급됩니다. 이는 또한 대체 배당 지급금에도 적용됩니다. 
다음의 경우 워시 세일 적용가능 거래로 취급되지 않습니다.
  * 해당 거래를 통한 지분 처분 또는 획득과 연관된 국내에서 규제되는 QIE로부터 실제로 분배금을 받은 경우.
  * 귀하가 분배금 지급일로부터 1년 기간동안 언제라도 이 종류 주식의 5%이상을 갖고 있지 않은 경우에만, 미국의 기존 주식 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 QIE의 어떤 종류의 주식이든 처분하는 경우.


**대체 최저세.**
미국 부동산 지분의 처분에 의한 순이득에 최저세가 부과될 수 있습니다. 세금이 있다면 양식 6251에서 그 액수를 산정하십시오. 
**세금 원천징수.**
미국 부동산 지분을 처분한다면, 매입자는 세금을 원천징수 해야 할 수 도 있습니다. 8장에서 [부동산 매각에 대한 세금 원천징수](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000101102 "부동산 매각에 대한 세금 원천징수")에 관한 논의를 참고하십시오. 
#### 특정 파트너쉽 지분 매각 및 교환에 대한 외국인의 이득 및 손실
귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 (또는 종사하는 것으로 취급되는) 미국 또는 외국 파트너쉽의 직접 또는 간접 외국 파트너이고, 귀하가 직접 또는 간접적으로 해당 지분을 처분하는 경우, 파트너쉽 지분의 처분에 대한 이득 또는 손실은 연방 세금에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 섹션 864(c)(8)에 따라 파트너쉽 지분의 판매, 교환 또는 그 밖의 처분으로 인한 이득 및 손실은 실질적으로 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업의 활동과 연관이 있다고 간주합니다. (“실질적으로 연결된 이득” 또는 “실질적으로 연결된 손실”). 하지만, 실질적으로 연결된 이득 또는 실질적으로 연결된 손실의 액수는 파트너쉽이 처분 일 기준으로 공정 시장 가치에 자산의 모두를 처분했을 경우 발생했을 실질적으로 연결된 이득 또는 손실에 대한 분배 지분의 일부로 제한됩니다.
섹션 864(c)(8)은 2017년 11월 27일, 또는 이후에 발생한 판매, 교환 또는 기타 처분에 적용됩니다. 2020년 11월 6일에, 섹션 864(c)(8)에 따라, 2018년 12월 26일 이후에 발생한 양도에 적용가능한 최총 규제가 발표되었습니다. 규제 섹션 1.864(c)(8)-1(j)를 참고하십시오.
#### 해외 소득
다음과 같은 경우, 세 종류의 외국 출처 소득을 반드시 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 취급해야 합니다.
  * 소득이 귀속될 수 있는 사무실 등 고정된 사업 장소를 미국에 가지고 있고,
  * 사무실 또는 사업의 장소는 소득을 발생시키는 중요한 요인이며,
  * 사무실 등 다른 고정된 사업 장소에서 시행된 일반적인 사업 과정을 통해서 소득이 발생했을 경우.


사무실 또는 다른 고정된 사업 장소가 소득 발생에 중요한 영향을 미치고 기본적인 경제 요소라면 이는 주요 요인입니다.
세가지의 외국 출처 소득이 아래에 열거되어있습니다.
  1. 미국 밖에 위치한 무형의 개인 자산 또는 이러한 자산의 임대, 사용 또는 사용의 특권에 대한 임대료 또는 로열티. 임대료 또는 로열티가 미국에서의 활동적인 거래 또는 사업의 시행으로 부터 기인한 것이라면 미국 국외의 사용 또는 사용 특권에 대한 임대료 또는 로열티, 그리고 특허, 저작권, 비밀 기법 및 가공법, 영업, 상표, 상표 브랜드, 프랜차이즈 그리고 비슷한 자산이 포함됩니다.
  2. 미국에서 은행, 금융 또는 비슷한 활동적 사업의 시행으로부터 받은 배당금, 이자 또는 2010년 9월 27일 이후 발급된 채무의 보증 조항에 의해 받은 금액. 증권 대출 거래 또는 환매 조건부 판매 거래를 통해 받은 대체 배당금 또는 이자 지급금은 양도된 증권에 대해 받은 총액과 동일하게 취급됩니다.
  3. 미국의 사무실 또는 고정 사업 장소를 통해 해외 판매로부터 얻은 소득, 이득, 또는 손실에는 다음과 같은 것이 있습니다.
    1. 거래 주식,
    2. 과세연도 말에 소유하고 있었다면, 재고자산에 포함되었을 자산
    3. 사업의 일반적인 과정에서 고객에게 판매를 위해 주요하게 보유한 자산.
미국 외에서의 사용, 소비, 처분을 위한 자산을 판매했으며 외국의 사무실 또는 고정 사업 장소가 판매의 중요한 요소인 경우에는 항목 (3)가 적용되지 않습니다.


위에 설명된 소득의 항목과 동등한 해외 출처 소득은 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 취급됩니다. 예를 들어, 이 소득이 외국인이 미국에서 은행, 금융, 또는 유사한 종류의 사업을 통해 얻은 소득이라면 외국 출처 이자 및 배당금 동등 지급금은 미국에 실질적으로 연결된 소득으로 취급됩니다.
#### 실질적으로 연결된 소득에 대한 세금
귀하가 해당 과세연도에 얻은 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 소득은 허용가능 공제 후에 미국 시민 또는 거주자에게 적용되는 세율로 과세됩니다.
일반적으로 오직 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 비거주 외국인만 해당 과세연도에 실질적으로 연결된 소득을 받을 수 있습니다. 하지만 귀하가 미국 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않은 과세연도에 자산 판매 또는 교환, 서비스 시행, 또는 다른 거래에 대해 받은 대금이 있지만 이런 대금이 서비스를 시행하거나 거래가 발생한 연도에 실질적으로 연결된 소득으로 취급될 수 있었다면, 대금을 수령한 과세연도에 실질적으로 연결된 소득으로 취급됩니다.
**예시.**
테드 리처드는 그의 해외 고용주의 미국 사무실에서 개인적인 서비스를 시행하기 위해 미국에 2023년 8월에 입국했습니다. 테드는 미국 사무실에서 2023년 12월 25일까지 일했지만 2024년 1월 11일까지 미국을 떠나지 않았습니다. 2024년 1월 8일에 테드는 2023년 동안 미국에서 수행한 서비스에 대한 마지막 급여를 받았습니다. 여기에 머무는 동안 테드의 모든 소득은 미국 출처 소득입니다.
2023년에 테드는 미국에서 개인 서비스를 시행하는 거래 또는 사업에 종사하였습니다. 따라서 2023년에 그가 미국에서 수행한 서비스에 대해 받은 총액수는 실질적으로 2023년에 거래 또는 사업과 연결됩니다.
2024년 1월에 테드가 받은 급여는 테드에게 2024년 미국 출처 소득입니다. 테드는 2023년에 미국에서 소득을 벌어들인 서비스를 시행했기 때문에 이는 실질적으로 연결된 소득입니다. 따라서 테드는 2023년에 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것으로 취급 될 수 있었습니다.
**부동산 소득**
모든 부동산 소득이 실질적으로 연결이 되도록 취급하게 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 장의 뒷부분에서 [_부동산 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222359 "부동산 출처 소득")을 참고하십시오.
#### 30% 세금
30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율의 과세는 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되어 있지 않은 특정 항목에 대한 미국 출처 소득 또는 이득에만 적용됩니다.
#### 고정적 또는 확정 가능한 소득
30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율은 미국 출처의 고정적, 확정 가능한, 연간 또는 기간별 (FDAP) 이득, 이익, 소득의 총액에 적용됩니다.
미리 알려진 금액으로 지불이 될 때 소득은 고정적인 것입니다. 지급받을 금액을 산정하기 위한 기초가 있다면 소득은 확정 가능한 것입니다. 간간히 지불된다면, 소득은 주기적이 될 수 있습니다. 이는 연간 또는 일정한 기간으로 지급되어야만 하는 것은 아닙니다. 지급이 발생하는 기간이 증가하거나 감소한다고 하더라도, 소득은 확정 가능하거나 주기적일 수 있습니다.
특정적으로 고정적 또는 확정 가능한 소득으로 포함된 항목들은 이자 (OID 외의), 배당금, [배당 동등 지급금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000257128 "배당 동등 지급금.") (2장에서 정의된), 임대료, 보험료, 연금, 연봉, 급여 및 다른 보수가 포함되어 있습니다. 증권 대출 거래 또는 환매 조건부 판매 거래를 통해 받은 대체 배당 또는 이자 지급금은 양도된 증권에 대해 받은 금액으로 동일하게 취급됩니다. 로열티와 같은 기타 소득 항목에도 30% 세율이 적용될 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_어떤 고정적 또는 확정 가능한 소득은 미국 세금으로부터 예외 일 수 도 있습니다. 소득의 과세 여부가 확실하지 않다면_[3장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222259 "총소득에서 제외") _을 참고하십시오._.
**발행시 할인 (OID).**
발행시 할인 된 채권 등 부채 상품을 매각, 교환, 또는 대금을 수령한다면, OID의 전체 또는 일부에 대해서 (포트폴리오 이자가 아닌) 30% 세금이 적용될 수 있습니다. OID의 금액은 명시된 만기 상환 가격과 채무증서 발행 시 가격의 차이입니다. 다음과 같은 상황에서는 30% 세금이 적용됩니다. 
  1. 채권증서에 대한 대금을 받았을 경우. 이 경우에 세금이 적용되는 OID의 금액은 귀하가 이 채권증서를 소유하는 동안 누적된 OID에서 이전에 산정한 OID를 제외한 값입니다. 하지만 OID에 대한 세금은 채권증서 이자 지급액에서 세금을 뺀 지급액 보다 많을 수 없습니다.
  2. 채권증서를 매각 또는 교환했을 경우. 세금이 적용되는 OID의 금액은 귀하가 이 채권증서를 소유하는 동안 누적된 OID에서 위의 (1)에서 이미 과세된 금액을 제외한 값입니다.


만약 발행 시 채권증서를 구입했다면, 양식 1042-S에 보여진 OID의 금액을 세금 신고서에 신고하십시오. 그러나, 다음의 어떤 것이라도 적용된다면, 양식 1042-S에 있는 알맞은 OID의 금액을 반드시 재산정해야 합니다. 
  * 채권증서를 할증에 구매했거나 또는 인수 할증을 지불했을 경우.
  * 채권증서가 (미국에 재무부 유가 증권에 의해 담보되는 무이표 채권을 포함하여) 분리채와 분리 이표인 경우.
  * 채권증서가 조건부 지원금 또는 물가지수 연동 채권증서인 경우.


프리미엄과 인수 프리미엄의 정의에 대해 그리고 OID를 재산정 하는 방법에 대한 설명은 [간행물 1212(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-1212)을 참고하십시오.
#### 도박 상금.
소득이 실질적으로 미국 거래 또는 사업에 연관되지 않았으며 협정에 의해 제외되지 않는다면, 일반적으로, 비거주 외국인은 미국에서 이긴 도박 총수익금에 대해 30%의 세금이 적용됩니다. 하지만 비거주 외국인이 미국에서 블랙잭, 바카라, 크랩, 룰렛 또는 빅식스휠에서 이겨서 생긴 도박 소득에는 세금이 부과되지 않습니다.
비거주 외국인은 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 미국에서 이긴 도박 순 소득에 차등 세율로 과세합니다.이 소득은 몇몇의 세금 협정하에 면제됩니다. [IRS.gov/TreatyTables(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/tax-treaty-tables)에 있는 세금 협정 표의 표 1에서 미국 세금에서 면제된 도박 상금의 목록을 보십시오. 더 자세한 내용은 [간행물 915(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/Pub915)을 참고하십시오.
#### 사회보장 혜택
비거주 외국인은 반드시 미국 사회보장 혜택 (그리고 사회보장 동등의 1급 철도 퇴직 혜택 부분)의 85%를 미국 출처 FDAP 소득으로 포함해야 합니다. 사회보장 혜택은 월별 은퇴, 생존자, 장애 혜택을 포함합니다. 이 소득은 일부 조세협정에 따라 제외됩니다. 미국 세금으로부터 사회보장 헤택을 제외하는 조세협정의 리스트는 [IRS.gov/TreatyTables(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/international-taxpayers/tax-treaty-tables)에서 제공하는 조세협정 표의 표1을 참고하십시오. 더 자세한 내용은 [간행물 915(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-915)를 참고하십시오.
#### 자본 자산의 매각 또는 교환
미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되지 않은 미국 출처 자본 소득 및 손실에 대해서만 이 규칙을 적용합니다. 귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하였더라도 이 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이 규칙은 미국 부동산 지분의 판매 혹은 교환 또는 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 자산의 판매에는 적용되지 않습니다. 위의 _실질적으로 연결된 소득_ 에서 [_부동산 이득 또는 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222331 "부동산 이득 또는 손실")을 참고하십시오.
자본 자산은 귀하가 소유한 모든 것 중 아래를 제외한 것입니다.

  * 사업 외상 매출금 및 수취 어음,
  * 거래 또는 사업에 사용되는 감가상각 가능 자산,

  * 파생 상품 딜러가 보유한 특정 파생 금융 상품, 또는
  * 헤징 거래.


자본 이득이란 자본 자산의 매각 또는 교환에 대한 이득입니다. 자본 손실은 자본 자산의 매각 또는 교환에 대한 손실입니다.
외환으로 판매가 되었다면 소득 확정 목적으로 자산의 비용과 판매 가격은 반드시 판매 일과 구매 일이 각각 기준 미국 통화로 우세 환율에 표시되어야 합니다.
자본 자산의 매각 또는 교환 또는 어떤것이 이렇게 취급되는 것인지를 확인하기 위해 [간행물 544(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-544)를 참고하십시오. 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인에게 적용되는 특정 세제 혜택은 일반적으로 귀하에게 적용되지 않습니다.
다음의 이득은 183일 규칙에 상관 없이 30% (또는 더 낮은) 세율이 적용됩니다.
  1. 유보 경제 지분이 있는 목재, 석탄, 또는 국내 철광석의 처분에 대한 이득.
  2. 1966년 10월 4일 이후에 특허, 저작권 또는 동류의 자산의 판매 교환으로부터 받은 조건부 지급액에 대한 이득.

  4. 발행시 할인 채권의 판매 또는 교환에 대한 이득.


귀하가 해당 이득을 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된것으로 취급하기로 선택해다면 (1)에서의 이득은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율이 적용되지 않습니다. 이후에 [_부동산 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222359 "부동산 출처 소득")을 참고하십시오.
**183일 규칙.**
해당 과세연도에 미국에서 183일 이상 체류했다면, 귀하의 자본 자산의 판매 및 교환의 순 이득은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정)세율로 과세됩니다. 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정)세율의 목적으로, 순이득은 미국 출처의 자본 손실을 초과하는 미국 출처의 자본 이득입니다. 이 규칙은 귀하가 미국에 체류하지 않은 동안에 발생한 거래에도 적용됩니다. 
귀하의 순이득을 판단하기 위해 귀하가 해당 연도에 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 종사했으며 이득 또는 손실이 해당 사업과 실질적 연관이 있었을 경우에만, 순이득이 실현되고 산정하는 범위 내에서만, 실현되고 산정될 이득 및 손실의 금액을 고려하십시오.
순 이득을 산정할때 다음 사항들은 고려하지 마십시오.
  * 이전에 나열된 네 가지 유형의 이득.
  * 자본 손실 이월에 대한 공제.
  * 자본 이득을 초과하는 자본 손실.
  * 적격 소규모 사업체 주식의 판매와 교환에 대한 소득의 제외 (섹션 1202 제외).
  * 개인적인 사용을 위해 소유된 자산의 판매와 교환에 대한 손실. 단, 연방에서 선언한 재해에 기인한 재해와 절도의 결과로 인한 손실은 스케줄 A (양식1040-NR)에서 공제 가능합니다. 5장에서 [_항목별 공제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222454 "항목별 공제")를 참고하십시오.


귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않고 이전 기간의 과세연도를 설정하지 않았다면 183일 규칙을 목적으로 귀하의 과세연도는 역년이 될 것입니다. 또한 역년을 기준으로 세금 신고서를 반드시 제출해야 합니다. 
해당 과세연도에 미국에서 183일 이하로 체류했었다면 자본 이득이 (앞서 나열한 이득 외에) 귀하의 과세연도에 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되어 있지 않는 한 세금 면제입니다.
**신고.**
미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되지 않은 자본 자산의 판매와 교환에서의 이득 및 손실을 스케줄 NEC (양식 1040-NR)에 신고하십시오. 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 자본 자산의 판매 및 교환에 대한 이득과 손실은 (부동산을 포함) 스케줄 D (양식1040), 양식 4797, 또는 두 곳 모두에 다 신고하십시오. 이를 양식 1040-NR에 첨부하십시오.
#### 부동산 출처 소득
귀하가 소유하고 있거나, 지분이 있으며 소득 창출을 위해 보유하고 있는 미국 내에 위치한 부동산 출처 소득이 있다면, 귀하는 해당 부동산 출처 모든 소득을 미국내에서 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된것으로 취급하는 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 이 선택은 미국에 위치한 그리고 소득 창출을 위해 보유한 부동산 출처 모든 소득과 해당 부동산의 지분에 대한 모든 소득에 적용됩니다. 여기에는 임대, 탄광의 로열티, 가스정, 등 기타 천연 자원에 대한 소득이 포함됩니다. 유보 경제 지분이 있는 목재, 석탄, 또는 국내 철광석의 판매 또는 교환 이득이 포함됩니다.
미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결되지 않았을 부동산 소득에 대해서만 이 선택을 할 수 있습니다.
이 선택을 하면, 부동산 소득에 기인한 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 그리고 부동산에 대한 순 소득만 과세됩니다.
이 선택은 다른 경우에 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않았을 비거주 외국인은 해당 연도에 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한 것으로 취급합니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 비거주 외국인이고 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하지 않고 있습니다. 귀하는 미국에 단독 주택을 소유하고 있으며 임대를 주고 있습니다. 연간 임대료 소득은 $10,000입니다. 이는 귀하의 유일한 미국 출처 소득입니다. 앞서 [_30% 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222345 "30% 세금")에서 논의한 것 처럼, 임대료 소득에는 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율이 적용됩니다. 귀하는 입주자가 적절하게 임대 소득으로부터 세금을 원천징수 한 것을 증명하는 양식 1042-S를 받았습니다. 귀하의 미국 조세 의무는 세금 원천징수에 의해 충족되기 때문에 미국 세금 신고서를 (양식 1040-NR) 제출할 필요가 없습니다.
이전에 언급된 선택을 한다면, 귀하는 소득의 $10,000를 특정 임대 비용으로 상쇄할 수 있습니다. ([간행물 527(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-527)을 참고하십시오.) 총 소득은 차등 세율로 과세됩니다.
이 선택을 하게 되면 임대 소득 및 비용을 스케줄E (양식 1040)에 신고해야 합니다. 스케줄 E (양식 1040)의 순 임대 소득 또는 손실을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 파트 1, 라인 5에 입력하십시오. 스케줄1 (양식 1040)과 스케줄E (양식 1040)를 양식 1040-NR에 첨부하십시오. 선택의 첫 해에 또한 아래에서 논하는 진술서를 첨부하십시오.
**선택하기.**
선택된 연도에 대한 세금 신고서, 또는 수정된 신고서에 진술을 첨부하여 첫 선택을 하십시오. 다음의 내용을 진술서에 포함해야 합니다. 
  * 귀하가 선택을 한다는 사실.
  * 섹션 871(d) (앞서 설명함)에 따른 선택인지 또는 조세협정에 의한 것인지 여부.
  * 미국에 위치한 귀하의 모든 부동산, 또는 부동산 지분에 대한 모든 목록. 귀하에게 지분이 있는 목재, 석탄, 또는 철광석의 법적 식별 증서를 제공하십시오.
  * 부동산 지분의 범위.
  * 자산의 위치.
  * 자산의 주요 개선 사항에 대한 설명.
  * 이 자산을 소유한 날짜들.
  * 이 자산으로부터 소득.
  * 이전 선택의 구체적인 사항과 부동산 소득 선택의 철회. 


이 선택은 철회하지 않는 한 모든 과세연도에 효력을 갖습니다. 
**선택 철회.**
선택을 한 연도와 이후 과세연도에 1040-X 를 제출하여 IRS의 허가 없이 선택을 철회할 수 있습니다. 본인의 세금 신고서를 제출한 3년 이내에 또는 세금을 납부한 시간으로부터 2년 이내 중 더 늦은 기간 안에 반드시 양식 1040-X를 제출해야 합니다. 만약 이번 기간에 대한 선택이 만료되는 연도라면 해당 연도에 대한 선택을 철회할 수 없습니다. 하지만 이후 과세연도에는 오직 IRS 허가를 받은 경우에 선택을 철회할 수 있습니다. IRS의 허가를 받는 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 규제 1.871-10(d)(2)를 참고하십시오.
### 비고.
이제 세금 신고 소프트웨어를 사용하여 2019년 혹은 이후 연도 양식 1040와 1040–SR, 그리고 2021년 혹은 이후 연도 양식 1040–NR를 수정하는 양식 1040–X를 전자 제출 할 수 있습니다. [IRS.gov/Form1040X](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-1040x)를 참고하십시오.
#### 수송 세금
앞서 [_수송 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222328 "수송 소득")에서 열거된 두 가지 조건을 충족하지 않기 때문에 실질적으로 연결되지 않은 수송 소득에 4% 세율이 적용됩니다. 귀하가 4%이 적용되는 수송소득을 받았다면, 이에 대한 세금을 산정해서 양식 1040-NR, 라인 23에 기입해야 합니다. 귀하의 세금 신고서에 다음 정보를 (해당된다면) 포함하는 진술서를 첨부하십시오.
  * 귀하의 이름, TIN 및 과세연도.
  * 시행된 서비스의 유형에 대한 설명 (선내 또는 선외인지).
  * 귀하가 서비스를 시행한 선박의 이름 또는 항공기의 등록 번호.
  * 선박 또는 항공기에 대한 각 유형의 서비스에서 비롯한 해당 연도의 미국 출처 수송 소득의 액수.
  * 모든 유형의 서비스에서 비롯된 해당 연도의 미국 출처 수송 소득의 총액.


귀하의 모든 미국 출처 수송 소득에 해당 4% 세금이 적용됩니다. 수송이 미국 내에서 시작되고 끝나는 미국 내 출처로부터 비롯된 것으로 취급되는 수송 소득 만을 포함합니다. 개인적인 서비스에 대한 수송 소득의 경우 미국과 미국 영토 사이의 수송이어야 합니다. 비거주 외국인의 개인 서비스의 경우, 항공기로 부터 비롯되거나 연관된 소득에만 적용됩니다.
#### 거주 중단 기간
미국 비거주 기간으로 인해 미국 거주 기간을 중단한다면 특별한 규칙에 따라 세금이 적용됩니다. 다음의 조건의 모두를 충족한다면 해당 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다.
  1. 귀하는 최소 연속 3년을 포함하는 기간 동안 미국 거주자였을 경우.
  2. 각 해당 연도 마다 최소 183일 동안 미국 거주자였을 경우.
  3. 귀하가 미국 거주자로서 간주되는 것을 중단했을 경우.
  4. 위의 (1)에서 설명하는 기간 종료 이후에 세 번째 연도의 말 이전에 다시 미국 거주자가 됐을 경우.


이 규칙에 따라서, 모든 해당되는 협정 혜택을 감안한 후 섹션 871 (앞에서 논의한 비거주 외국인의 소득에 대한 과세에 보통 적용되는 규칙)에 의해 더 높은 세금이 귀하에게 적용되지 않는 이상, 귀하가 비거주가 였던 시기의 미국 출처 총 순 소득 및 이득은 개인에게 (허용 가능 공제 후)해당되는 누진세율의 세금이 적용됩니다. 특별 세금을 산정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 뒷 부분에서 [_국적포기세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222368 "국적포기세")를 참고하십시오.

#### 해당 국적 포기자인 경우 국적포기세 산정 방법
국적 포기 하루전에 자산을 공정시장 가격으로 판매했을때의 비실현 순 이익 (또는 손실) (“시가평가") 에 대한 소득세가 국적을 포기했던 연도에 적용됩니다. 이는 시민권의 포기 당일 또는 거주 종료 당일에 보유하고 있는 대부분 유형의 자산 지분에 적용됩니다. 하지만 이후에 [_예외_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222398 "예외.")를 참고하십시오.
간주된 판매로부터 발생한 이득은 간주된 판매가 있었던 해에 반드시 다른 미국 국세법에 관계 없이 고려되어야 합니다. 간주된 판매로 발생한 손실은 미국 국세법에 명시된 한도내에서 고려되어야 합니다. 하지만 섹션 1091 (주식 및 증권의 워시 세일에서 손실의 비허용에 관련)은 적용하지 않습니다. 2024년에 국적을 포기 했거나 거주를 종료했다면 귀하의 소득에 달리 의무적으로 포함시켜야만 하는 순 소득에서 $866,000을 차감하십시오. (하지만 0 미만으로는 안됩니다.)

  1. 적격 이연 보수 항목.
  2. 부적격 이연 보수 항목.
  3. 비증여자 신탁 지분.
  4. 특정 세금 이연 계정.


단, 항목 (1) 과 (3)은 출처에 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 항목 (2)의 경우, 귀하의 국적 포기 당일 누적된 혜택을 현재가치로 수령한 것으로 간주됩니다. 항목 (4)의 경우, 귀하의 국적 포기 당일 하루전에 계좌의 총 지분에 대한 분배금을 받는 것으로 간주됩니다. 자세한 정보는 양식 8854의 지침 및 공지 2009-85를 참고하십시오.
#### 국적포기세 신고서
미국 시민권 포기 또는 장기 체류를 종료한 해에 본인이 해당 국적 포기자가 아니라고 하더라도 첫 양식 8854를 제출해야 합니다. 추가로, 납세자는 반드시 국적 포기 이후 국적 포기 대상자이거나 다음의 경우와 같다면, 양식 8854를 해마다 제출해야 합니다.
  1. 시가평가 세금의 이연 납부 (뒷부분의 _[시가평가 세금의 이연 납부](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222400 "시가평가 세금의 이연 납부.")_ 를 참고하십시오.)
  2. 적격 이연 보수 항목이 있거나, 또는
  3. 비증여자 신탁에 대한 지분이 있음.


**시가평가 세금의 이연 납부.**
귀하는 자산의 간주된 판매에 부과되는 시가평가 세금을 이연 납부하는 철회 불가 선택을 할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 한다면, 다음과 같은 규칙이 적용됩니다. 
  1. 자산별 기준 선택을 할 수 있습니다.
  2. 자산을 처분한 과세연도의 신고서에 특정 자산에 기인한 이연 세금을 납부해야 합니다.
  3. 이자는 세금이 이연된 기간에 대해 부과됩니다.
  4. 이연 세금의 납부기한은 다음의 날짜보다 조기에 연장이 되지 않습니다.
    1. 사망한 해에 요구되는 신고서 기한.
    2. 자산에 대해 제공된 보증이 충분하지 못한 기간. 아래 항목 (6)을 참고하십시오.
  5. 양식 8854에 선택을 합니다.
  6. 충분한 담보 (채권 등)를 제공해야 합니다.
  7. 시가평가 세금에 대한 과세 및 징수를 불가능하게 할 모든 미국의 협정 권리에 대해 철회 불가능한 권리 포기를 해야만 합니다.

#### 과세 연도
귀하는 반드시 과세연도라고 불리는 연간 회계연도에 기초하여 소득을 산정해야하고 세금 신고서를 제출해야만 합니다. 회계 과세연도를 확립하지 않았다면, 귀하의 과세연도는 역년이 됩니다. 역년이란 12월 31일에 끝나는 연속적인 12 달을 의미합니다. 귀하가 이전에 정규 회계연도 (12월이 아닌 달의 마지막 날 또는 52-53주에 끝난 연속 12개월)을 확립했고 어느 역년에 미국 거주자로 고려된다면, 귀하는 역년 내의 회계 년도의 일부에 대해서 미국 거주자로 간주됩니다.
#### 식별 번호
납세자 식별 번호 (TIN)는 반드시 세금 신고서, 진술서 그리고 기타 세금 관련 서류에 기제 되어야 합니다. 개인의 경우, 이는 사회보장번호 (SSN)입니다. 귀하가 SSN을 갖고 있지 않거나 SSN을 받기에 부적격 하다면, 개인 납세자 식별번호 (ITIN)를 신청해야만 합니다. 고용주 식별 번호 (EIN)은 개인 사업자로써 거래 또는 사업에 종사하고 있거나 직원이 있거나 또는 적격 은퇴 플랜을 갖고 있다면 요구됩니다.
다음에 해당한다면, 납세자 식별 번호를 제공해야만 합니다.
  * 해당 연도에 언제라도 미국 거래 또는 사업의 시행과 실질적으로 연결된 소득있는 외국인,
  * 해당 연도에 언제라도 미국 사무실 또는 사업 장소를 가진 외국인,
  * 1장에서 논의한 [거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자"), 또는
  * 세금 신고서, 수정된 신고서 또는 환급 청구서를 제출하는 기타 외국인 (하지만 정보 신고서는 아님).


**사회보장 번호 (SSN).**
일반적으로 영주권자로써 미국에서 합법적으로 입국을 했거나 또는 다른 미국에서의 고용이 허가된 이민의 법에 따라 SSN을 받을 수 있습니다. 
SSN이 없다면 사회보장국 (SSA)에 연락하여 이에 적격한지 알아보십시오. 더 자세한 내용은 [SSA.gov(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/)을 방문하거나 800–772–1213 (청각 장애 및 난청이 있다면 TTY 번호, 800–325–0778로 전화)로 전화하십시오.
_**국제 학생.**_
F-1, M-1, J-1 비자 중 하나를 갖고 있다면 [SSA.gov/Pubs/10181.html(영어)](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10181.html)에 있는 SSA 간행물 05-10181을 참고하십시오.
**개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN).**
이미 ITIN을 보유하고 있다면, 세금 신고서에 SSN이 요구되는 곳에 이 ITIN을 입력하면 됩니다. ITIN이 없거나 SSN을 받을 자격이 없다면, ITIN를 신청해야만합니다. ITIN을 신청하는 구체적인 방법은 [양식 W-7](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7) 및 이에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
만약 ITIN에 적격하고 신청서가 완료되었다면, TIN이 발급되었다는 IRS의 서신을 보통 7주 내에 받게 됩니다. 신청 후 7주후에 ITIN 이나 다른 통신문을 받지 못했다면, 미국에 체류중인 경우 신청서 현황을 문의하기 위해 IRS 수신자 전화 번호 800-829-1040로 전화하십시오. 해외에 있다면 267-941-1000 (수신자 부담 번호 아님)로 전화하십시오.
ITIN은 세금 용도로만 사용됩니다. 이 번호는 사회보장 혜택을 받거나 미국 법에 따라 고용 또는 이민 신분을 변경할 수 없습니다.
TIN 제공이 요구되고 SSN에 부적격인 외국인의 경우, 허용된 세금 혜택에 적격하며 SSN 발급 대상이 아닌 외국인 배우자 또는 부양가족에 대한 양식 W-7을 반드시 제출해야 합니다.
양식 W-7의 지침 및 [IRS.gov/ITIN](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number)에는 ITIN을 받기 위한 추가적인 정보가 있습니다.
_**ITIN 만료.**_
일부 ITIN은 반드시 갱신해야 합니다. 과세연도 2021, 2022, 2023년에 대한 연방 세금 신고서를 최소 한번 이상 제출한 적이 없다면 ITIN은 2024년 말에 만료되며, 과세연도 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출하려면 반드시 갱신해야 합니다. 연방 세금 신고서를 제출할 필요가 없다면 ITIN을 갱신할 필요가 없습니다. ITIN 갱신을 위해서 [IRS.gov/FormW7](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7)에서 양식 W-7 및 이에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오. 더 자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov/ITIN](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number)을 방문하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_2013년 이전에 발급된 ITIN은 만료되었으며 과세연도 2024년 세금 신고서를 제출해야 한다면 반드시 이를 갱신해야 합니다. 이전에 갱신 신청서를 제출했으며 허가가 난 경우, 과세연도 2021, 2022, 2023년에 대한 연방 세금 신고서에서 최소 한번 이상 ITIN을 사용하지 않은 적이 없었던 이상, 다시 갱신하지 않아도 됩니다._.
**고용주 식별 번호 (EIN).**
개인 세금을 위해 SSN (또는 ITIN), 그리고 사업 세금을 위해서는 EIN을 사용할 수 있습니다. EIN에 대한 더 자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov/EIN](https://www.irs.gov/ko/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/get-an-employer-identification-number)을 참고하십시오.
#### 납세자 구분
귀하 세금의 액수는 귀하의 납세자 구분에 기초합니다. 납세자 구분은 특정 공제 및 세액공제을 받을 수 있는지 결정할 때 중요합니다. 납세자 구분을 결정하기 위한 거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인에 대한 규칙은 다릅니다.
#### 거주 외국인
거주 외국인은 미국인에게 제공되는 같은 납세자 구분을 사용할 수 있습니다. 납세자 구분에 대한 자세한 내용은 양식의 지침 또는 [간행물 501(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-501)을 참고하십시오.
**부부 공동 신고.**
일반적으로, 본인과 배우자 모두가 과세연도 전체 기간 동안 미국 시민 또는 거주 외국인이였거나, 또는 1장에서 논의한 것 처럼 [거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")가 되기로 선택했다면 부부 공동 신고를 할 수 있습니다 
**적격 생존 배우자.**
귀하의 배우자가 2022년 또는 2023년에 사망하였고 귀하가 2024년 말 전에 재혼하지 않았다면, 적격 생존 배우자로 신고하기에 적격할 수 있으며 공동 신고 세율을 사용할 수 있습니다. 이는 귀하의 배우자가 사망한 해에 귀하가 배우자와 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있었을 때만 해당됩니다.
적격 생존 배우자 납세자 구분에 대한 자세한 정보는 2024년 [양식 1040 지침](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-1040)에 있는 _납세자 구분_ 에서 _적격 생존 배우자_ 를 참고하십시오. 
**세대주.**
해당 연도의 마지막 날에 미혼, 또는 미혼으로 여겨지며 본인 및 적격한 사람의 가정을 유지하기 위한 비용의 반 이상을 귀하가 부담했다면 세대주 자격이 될 수 있습니다. 귀하는 반드시 과세연도 전체 동안 거주 외국인이여야 합니다.
만약 배우자가 해당 연도의 어느 한시점에라도 비거주 외국인이였고 배우자가 거주자로 간주되기를 선택하지 않았다면, 1장에서 논의한 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")처럼 이 목적으로는 미혼으로 간주합니다.
### 비고.
거주 외국인과의 결혼한 이유로 세대주 목적상으로 귀하가 미혼으로 간주되더라도, 귀하는 여전히 근로 소득 세액공제 목적으로 기혼자로 간주될 수 있습니다. 이 경우에는, 별거하는 배우자에 대한 특별 규칙을 충족해야 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 596](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-596)을 참고하십시오.
#### 비거주 외국인
귀하가 양식 1040-NR을 제출하는 비거주 외국인이라면 이후에 논의할 납세자 구분 중 하나를 사용할 수 있습니다.
**기혼 비거주 외국인.**
미국 시민 또는 거주자와 결혼하지 않은 기혼 비거주 외국인은 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 소득에 대한 세금을 결정할 때, 반드시 부부 개별 신고에 대한 세금 표 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용해야만 합니다. 
_**예외.**_
일반적으로 기혼 비거주 외국인은 미혼 개인에 대한 세금 표 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용할 수 없습니다. 단, 귀하가 해당 연도의 마지막 6개월 간 배우자와 함께 살지 않았으며, 귀하가 캐나다, 멕시코, 대한민국의 기혼 거주자이거나 기혼의 미국 국적자라면 미혼으로 제출할 수 있습니다. 본인이 적격인지 확인하려면 양식 1040-NR에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오. “미국 국적자 ”는 이 섹션의 후반부에서 정의합니다.
일반적으로 비거주 외국인은 부부 공동 신고를 할 수 없습니다. 하지만 미국 시민 또는 거주자와 결혼한 비거주 외국인은 거주 외국인으로 간주되는 것을 선택하면 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR를 통해 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 이러한 선택에 대한 정보는 [1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?")을 참고하십시오. 공동 신고를 선택하지 않았다면, 양식 1040-NR을 제출하고 부부 개별 신고 개인을 위한 세금 표 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용할 수 있습니다. 
_**미국 국적자 (U.S. national).**_
미국 시민이 아니더라도, 미국에 대한 충성을 가지고 있는 개인은 미국 국적자로 고려합니다. 또한 미국 국적자에는 미국 시민 대신에 미국 국적자로 취급 될 것을 선택한 미국 영토 사모아 및 북 마리나제도 사람들을 포함합니다.

#### 미국령 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자
해당 과세연도 전체 동안 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자인 비거주 외국인이라면 일반적으로 거주 외국인과 같은 방식으로 과세됩니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR 제출해서 미국 내외의 출처로부터 모든 소득을 신고해야 합니다. 하지만 다음 단락에서 논하는 소득을 제외시킬 수 있습니다.
소득을 신고 목적 외에는 귀하는 비거주 외국인으로서 간주됩니다. 예를 들어, 귀하에게는 표준 공제가 허용되지 않으며, 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 없고, 해당 사람이 미국 시민, 또는 국적자가 아니라면 부양가족으로 청구할 수 없습니다. 또한 공제 및 세액공제 허용 한도가 있습니다. 이 장의 [_공제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222429 "공제"), [_항목별 공제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222454 "항목별 공제"), 및 [_세액공제 및 납부_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222479 "세액공제 및 납부")에서 _비거주 외국인_ 을 참고하십시오.
**푸에르토리코의 거주자.**
귀하가 해당 연도 전체에 푸에르토리코의 실제 거주자라면, 모든 푸에르토리코 출처 소득을 총 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. (미국 정부 직원 또는 기관의 직원으로서 수행한 서비스에 대한 액수가 아닌). 
역년을 기준으로 소득을 신고하고 2024년에 원천징수가 적용된 급여가 없다면, 2025년 6월 16일까지 신고서를 제출하고 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 또한 2025년 6월 16일까지 2025에 대한 첫 추정세를 납부해야 합니다. 공동으로 세금을 신고하거나 추정세를 공동납부할 수 없습니다. 미국 시민 또는 거주자와 결혼했다면 1장의 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")를 참고하십시오.
원천징수가 적용되는 급여를 벌었다면, 미국 소득세 신고서 제출 마감일은 2025년 4월 15일 입니다. 2025년 4월 15일까지 2025년 추정세 첫 납부를 해야 합니다. 원천징수와 추정세에 대한 자세한 정보는 [8장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222636 "원천징수 또는 추정세를 통한 세금 납부 ")을 확인하십시오. 
**미국 영토 사모아의 거주자.**
귀하가 해당 연도 전체에 미국 영토 사모아의 실제 거주자라면, 미국 영토 사모아 출처 소득을 총 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다 (미국 정부 직원 또는 기관의 직원으로서 수행한 서비스에 대한 액수가 아닌). 예외 적용의 목적으로 미국 영토 사모아 정부의 직원은 미국 정부의 직원 또는 정부 기관의 직원으로 간주하지 않습니다. 예외에 대한 자세한 정보는 양식 4563 및 [간행물 570(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-570)을 참고하십시오. 
## 6. 이중 신분 과세연도
#### 소개
동일 연도에 거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인이였다면 귀하에게는 이중 신분 과세연도가 있습니다. 이중 신분은 귀하의 시민권을 의미하지 않습니다. 이는 미국에서 조세 거주자 신분만을 의미합니다. 이중 신분 과세연도에 대한 미국 소득세를 결정할 때, 미국의 거주자였던 해당 연도중 기간과 비거주 외국인이였던 해당 연도의 기간에는 각각 다른 규칙이 적용됩니다.
가장 흔한 이중 신분 과세연도는 입국 하고 출국한 해입니다. 1장의 [_이중 신분 외국인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222162 "이중 신분 외국인")을 참고하십시오.
귀하가 결혼했고 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")가 되기로 선택했다면, 1장에서 설명되었듯이 이 장의 규칙은 해당 연도에 귀하에게 적용되지 않습니다.

#### 과세 연도
귀하는 반드시 “과세연도”라고 불리는 연간 회계 기간에 기초하여 세금 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 이전에 회계 과세연도를 확립하지 않았다면, 귀하의 과세연도는 역년입니다. 역년이란 12월 31일에 끝나는 연속된 12달을 의미합니다. 귀하가 이전에 정규 회계연도 (12월이 아닌 달의 마지막 날 또는 52-53주에 끝난 연속 12개월)를 확립했고 어느 역년에 대해 미국 거주자로 고려된다면, 귀하는 역년 내에 어딘가에 귀하의 회계 년도의 일부에 대해서 미국 거주자로 간주됩니다.
#### 세금이 적용되는 소득
귀하가 해당 연도에 거주 외국인이였던 동안에 모든 출처의 소득이 과세됩니다. 거주 외국인인 동안에 벌어들인 해외 출처 소득은 과세 대상입니다. 비거주 외국인일 동안에 소득이라고 하더라도 또는 소득을 받고 그 해 연말 전에 비거주 외국인이 되었다면 소득은 과세 대상입니다.
귀하가 해당 연도에 비거주 외국인이였던 동안에 미국 출처 소득 그리고 미국내 거래 또는 사업과 실질적인 연결이 되어 있다고 간주되는 특정 해외 출처 소득은 과세됩니다. 해외 출처 소득을 실질적으로 연결된 소득으로 간주하는 규칙은 4장의 [_해외 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222340 "해외 소득")에서 논합니다.
미국내 거래 또는 사업과 실질적인 연관이 없는 미국 밖의 출처 소득은 귀하가 비거주 외국인일때 수령했다면 과세되지 않습니다. 이 소득은 귀하가 거주 외국인일 동안에 벌었거나 또는 소득을 받은 후 그 해 연말 전에 거주 외국인 또는 미국 시민이되었다고 하더라도 과세 대상이 아닙니다.
구체적으로 국세법 또는 조세협정 조항에 따라 예외가 되지 않는 한 귀하가 비거주 외국인 또는 거주 외국인이였을때 수령한 것과 상관없이 미국 출처 소득은 과세 대상입니다. 일반적으로 조세협정 조항은 해당 연도에 귀하가 비거주 외국인이였던 때에만 적용됩니다. 하지만, 특정한 경우에는 협정 조항이 거주 외국인이였던 동안 적용이 될 수도 있습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 [9장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222713 "조세협정 혜택")을 참고하십시오.
미국에서 어떤 소득이 과세 되는지를 결정할 때, 귀하는 반드시 미국 세법에 따른 예외 뿐만 아니라 미국과 특정 해외 국가 간의 조세협정에 의해 제공되는 예외 및 경감된 세율도 고려해야 합니다. 조세협정에 대한 자세한 논의는 [9장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222713 "조세협정 혜택")을 참고하십시오.
#### 이중 신분 납세자에 대한 제한 사항
이중 신분 과세연도에 대한 세금 신고서를 제출한다면, 다음과 같은 제한 사항이 적용됩니다.
**표준 공제.**
귀하는 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에서 허용되는 표준 공제를 사용할 수 없습니다. 단, 항복별 허용 공제는 가능합니다. 
**세대주.**
세대주 세금 테이블 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용할 수 없습니다. 
**공동 신고서.**
공동 신고서 제출이 불가능합니다. 하지만 1장의 _이중 신분 외국인_ 에서 [_거주자 신분 선택하기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222177 "거주 외국인 신분 선택")를 참고하십시오. 
**세율.**
귀하가 기혼이며 과세연도의 전부 또는 일부 동안 미국의 비거주 외국인이고 [1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?")에서 설명되었듯이, 공동 제출을 선택하지 않았다면, 미국 내 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 소득에 대한 세금을 산정하기 위해, 반드시 부부 개별 신고의 세금 표 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용해야 합니다. 귀하는 부부 공동 신고 또는 미혼의 세금 표 또는 세금 산정 작업표를 사용할 수 없습니다. 단, 귀하가 해당 연도의 마지막 6개월 간 함께 살지 않았으며 다음의 경우라면 미혼으로 제출할 수 있습니다.
  * 캐나다, 멕시코, 대한민국의 기혼 거주자거나
  * 기혼 미국 국적자.


자격 여부를 확인하여면 양식 1040-NR의 지침을 참고하십시오. 
미국 국적자는 미국 시민이 아니더라도, 미국에 대한 충성을 맹세한 개인입니다. 미국 영토 사모아인과 북 마리나 제도인을 포함하는 미국 국적자는 미국 시민 대신에 미국 국적자로 취급 될 것을 선택할 수 있습니다. 
#### 부양가족
이중 신분 납세자로서, 귀하는 세금 신고서에 부양가족을 청구할 수도 있습니다. 일반적으로, 부양가족은 적격 자녀 또는 적격 친척입니다. 귀하에게 적격 부양가족이 있다면 추가적인 공제 및 세액공제를 신청할 자격이 될 수도 있습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 [양식 1040의 지침](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-1040) 또는 [양식 1040-NR의 지침(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/Form1040NR)을 참고하십시오.
귀하가 미국 국적자 또는 캐나다, 또는 멕시코의 거주자라면, 미국 시민과 같은 조건으로 부양가족을 청구할 수 있습니다. 대한민국, 인도의 거주자라면 [5장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222401 "세금 산정하기 ")을 참고하십시오.
#### 세금 산정 방법
이중 신분 과세연도에 대한 미국 세금을 산정할 때, 귀하가 거주자였던 연도의 일부에 대해 그리고 비거주자였던 연도의 일부에 대해 각각 다른 규칙이 적용됩니다.
#### 소득
거주자였던 기간에 대한 모든 소득 그리고 비거주자였던 기간에 미국내 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 모든 소득은 허용된 공제 이후에 추가되고 미국 시민과 거주자에게 적용되는 세율로 과세됩니다. 비거주자였던 기간 동안의 미국내 거래 또는 사업과 연결되지 않은 소득에는 고정 30% 세율 또는 더 낮은 협정 세율이 적용됩니다. 소득에 대한 그 어떤 공제도 받을 수 없습니다.
**사회보장 및 철도 퇴직 혜택.**
해당 연도에 비거주 외국인이였던 기간에 귀하가 받는 미국 사회보장 혜택의 85% (및 1급 철도 퇴직 혜택과 동등 부분)에는 예외가 아니라면 고정 30% 또는 더 낮은 협정 세율이 적용됩니다. (4장에서 [_30% 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222345 "30% 세금")을 참고하십시오.) 
해당 연도에 거주 외국인이였던 기간 동안, 사회보장의 일부 그리고 동등 한 1급 철도 퇴직 혜택의 일부는 수정된 조정총소득에 이 혜택의 반을 더한 값이 특정 기준 액수보다 높다면 차등 세율로 과세합니다. 
양식 1040의 지침에서 사회보장 혜택 작업표을 사용하면 해당 연도에 귀하가 거주 외국인이였던 기간 동안의 사회보장 및 동등한 1급 철도 퇴직 혜택의 과세 대상 부분을 산정하는 데 도움이 됩니다.
귀하가 비거주 외국인이였던 기간에 미국 사회보장 혜택을 받았다면, 사회보장국은 전체 연도에 대한 총 혜택 및 세금 원천징수의 액수가 나와있는 양식 SSA-1042S를 귀하에게 보낼 것입니다. 귀하가 미국 거주 외국인이였던 기간과 비거주 외국인이였던 기간 중에 받은 혜택에 대한 내역서를 따로 받지는 않습니다. 따라서 이 액수의 기록물을 유의하여 보관하는 것은 중요합니다. 세금 신고서를 제대로 작성하고 납부해야할 세액을 정확히 산정하기 위해 이 정보가 필요할 것입니다.
귀하가 비거주 외국인이였던 기간에 철도 퇴직 혜택을 받았다면, 미국 철도 퇴직 위원회 (RRB)는 귀하에게 양식 RRB-1042S, ‘철도 퇴직 위원회에 의해서 지급되는 비거주 수급자 내역서’와 양식 RRB-1099-R, ‘철도 퇴직 위원회가 지급한 연금 ‘을 보냅니다. 해당 과세연도에 귀하의 법적 거주 국가 또는 세율이 변경되었다면, 한 가지 이상의 양식을 받을 수도 있습니다.
#### 세액공제 및 납부
해당 논의는 이중 신분 외국인에 대한 세액공제와 납부에 대해 다룹니다.
#### 세액공제
이중 신분 외국인으로서 일반적으로 거주 외국인에게 적용되는 같은 규칙을 사용하여 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 여기에 적용될 수 있는 특정 제한 사항이 있을 수도 있습니다. 여기에서는 이러한 제한 사항들에 대해 논하며 개인들이 흔하게 청구하는 세액공제들에 대한 간단한 설명을 함께 제공합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)[1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?") _에서 논한 것 처럼, 귀하가 기혼자이며 미국 시민, 또는 거주 외국인인 배우자와 공동 신고서 제출을 통해 2024년 한해 전체에 거주 외국인으로 간주되기로 선택한 것이 아니라면 교육 세액공제, 근로 소득 세액공제, 고령자 및 장애인 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다._.
**해외 세금 세액공제.**
해외 출처 소득에 대해 해외 국가에 소득세를 납부했거나 납부에 대한 책임이 있다면, 귀하는 해외 세금에 대한 공제를 청구할 수도 있습니다. 
해외 세금 세액공제를 청구한다면 일반적으로 반드시 귀하의 소득세 신고서에 양식 1116을 함께 제출해야 합니다. 더 자세한 내용은 양식 1116의 지침 및 [간행물 514(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-514)를 참고하십시오.
**자녀 및 부양가족 케어 세액공제.**
귀하가 일을 하거나 구직을 할 수 있도록 부양가족인 13세 미만의 적격 자녀 또는 장애가 있는 부양가족, 또는 장애가 있는 배우자를 보살피기 위해 누군가에게 비용을 지불했다면, 이 세액공제에 적격일 수 있습니다. 
[1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?")에서 논한 것처럼 기혼 이중 신분 외국인은 공동 신고서를 제출하기를 선택한 경우에만 또는 그들이 함께 살지 않는 특정 기혼 개인으로 적격인 겨우에만 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
과세연도에 세액공제에 적격인 납세자의 자녀 및 부양가족 비용의 총액은 해당 과세연도에 대한 근로 소득 보다 많을 수 없습니다. 
더 자세한 사항은 [간행물 503(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-503) 및 양식 2441을 참고하십시오.
**은퇴 저축 기여 세액공제**
귀하가 2024년도에 고용주 제공 연금 플랜 또는 개인 연금 제도 (IRA)에 적격 기여를 했다면 이 세액공제 (저축인 세액공제라고도 함)에 적격이 될 수 있습니다. 다음의 경우에 이 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
  * 귀하가 2007년 1월 1일 이후에 태어난 경우,
  * 귀하가 풀타임 학생인 경우,
  * 귀하가 누군가의 2024 세금 신고서에 부양가족으로 청구된 경우, 또는
  * 귀하의 조정총소득이 $38,250을 넘는 경우.


세액공제를 산정하기 위해 양식 8880를 사용하십시오. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 590-A(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-a)를 참고하십시오.
**자녀 세액공제 및 추가 자녀 세액공제.**
자녀 세액공제와 추가 자녀 세액공제의 목적으로 “적격 자녀”란 다음과 같습니다. 
  * 2024년 말에 18세 미만이었습니다,
  * 귀하의 아들, 딸, 의붓 자녀, 적격 입양 자녀, 의붓형제, 의붓자매, 이복형제, 이복자매, 또는 이들의 부양가족 (예를 들어 손자 손녀, 조카 아들, 조카 딸) 입니다,
  * 미국 시민, 미국 국적자, 또는 거주 외국인입니다,
  * 2024년에 본인의 부양 비용을 반 이상을 부담하지 않았습니다,
  * 2024년의 반 이상을 귀하와 함께 살았습니다 (학교, 휴가, 병원 치료, 등 일시적인 부재는 집에서 산 시간으로 간주합니다.),
  * 귀하의 신고서에 부양가족으로 청구되어 있습니다.
  * 자녀는 해당 과세연도에 공동 신고서를 제출하지 않습니다 (또는 납부한 원천 소득세 또는 추정세의 환급만을 신청할 목적으로만 신고서를 제출합니다).


입양 자녀는 항상 본인의 자녀로 여깁니다. 입양 자녀에는 법적 입양을 위해 합법적으로 배치된 아동을 포함합니다.
납세자가 2024년 신고서 기한 또는 그 전 (연장 기한을 포함하여)에 발급된 SSN 또는 ITIN을 갖고 있지 않다면, 원래 2024년 세금 신고서나 수정된 세금 신고에서 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
귀하의 자녀가 2024년 신고서 제출 마감일 (연장 포함) 전에 발급된 고용에 유효한 SSN을 갖고 있지 않다면 귀하는 해당 자녀에 대한 자녀 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 하지만 해당 자녀에 대해 기타 부양가족에 대한 세액공제가 청구 가능할 수도 있습니다. 아래에서 _[기타 부양가족 세액공제](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100016482 "기타 부양가족을 위한 세액공제")_ 를 참고하십시오.
이 세액공제 산정을 위해 스케줄 8812 (양식 1040)를 사용하십시오.
**기타 부양가족을 위한 세액공제**
기타 부양가족을 위한 세액공제는 부양가족이 있는 사람들 중 자녀 세액공제에 신청할 수 없는 사람들을 위한 것입니다. 적격 부양가족은 반드시 미국 시민, 미국 국적자, 또는 미국 거주 외국인여야하며 반드시 2024년 신고서 제출 마감일 (연장 기한 포함) 이전에 발급된 SSN, ITIN 또는 ATIN를 소지하고 있어야 합니다. 스케줄 8812 (양식 1040) 및 이에 대한 지침에서 더 많은 정보를 참고하십시오.
**입양 세액공제.**
적격 자녀를 입양하기 위해 지불한 적격 비용에 대해 $16,810까지 세액공제를 받을 자격이 될 수도 있습니다. 이 액수는 적격 비용이 있는지에 상관없이 특수한 보살핌이 필요한 자녀 입양을 위해 허용될 수도 있습니다. 입양 세액공제 청구를 위해 양식 8839을 미국 소득세 신고서와 함께 제출하십시오.
기혼인 이중 신분 외국인은 1장에서 논의한 것처럼 [거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자") 신분을 선택했을 경우 또는 별거하는 특정 기혼 개인 (양식 8839에 대한 지침에 있는 _공동 신고를 하지 않은 기혼자_)으로 적격한 경우에만 이 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다.
#### 납부
납부한 세금이나 납부한 것으로 고려된 또는 소득에서 원청징수 된 특정 세금을 미국 소득세 채납에 대한 납세액으로써 신고할 수 있습니다. 여기에는 다음이 포함됩니다.
  * 미국에서 벌어들인 급여로부터 원천징수된 세금,
  * 급여 외에 미국 원천의 다양한 항목의 소득에서 원천징수된 세금,
  * 양식 1040-ES 또는 양식 1040-ES (NR)와 함께 납부한 추정세 그리고
  * 미국에서 출국 시에 양식 1040-C와 함께 납부한 세금.


#### 제출할 양식
이중 신분 외국인으로서 제출해야 하는 미국 소득세 신고서는 귀하가 해당 과세연도 말에 거주 외국인인지 비거주 외국인인지 여부에 따라 다릅니다.
**연도 말에 거주자.**
한 해 동안에 거주 외국인이였으며 해당 과세연도 마지막 날에 미국 거주자인 이중 신분 납세자는 반드시 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출해야 합니다. “Dual-Status Return” (이중 신분 신고서)를 소득세 신고서의 상단에 기제하십시오. 귀하의 소득 신고서에 증명서를 첨부하여 귀하가 비거주자였던 해당 연도의 기간에 소득을 보여주십시오. 양식 1040-NR을 증명서로 사용할 수 있지만 “Dual-Status Statement” (이중 신분 증명서)라고 상단에 분명히 기제하십시오. 
**연도 말에 비거주자.**
본인이 해당 연도에 거주를 포기했으며 해당 과세연도 말에 미국 거주자가 아닌 이중 신분 납세자라면 반드시 양식 1040-NR을 제출해야 합니다. “Dual-Status Return” (이중 신분 신고서)를 소득세 신고서의 상단에 기제하십시오. 귀하의 소득 신고서에 증명서를 첨부하여 귀하가 거주자였던 해당 연도의 기간에 소득을 보여주십시오. 양식 1040-NR을 증명서로 사용할 수 있지만 “Dual-Status Statement” (이중 신분 증명서)라고 상단에 분명히 기제하십시오. 
귀하가 2024년에 국적을 포기했거나 거주를 종료했다면, 세금 신고서와 함께 국적포기 증명서 (양식 8854)의 제출이 요구됩니다. 자세한 내용은 4장에서 [_국적포기세_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222368 "국적포기세")를 참고하십시오.
**증명서.**
증명서에 반드시 본인의 이름, 주소 그리고 TIN을 기제해야 합니다. 귀하의 신고서에 있는 서명은 증빙 서류 및 스케줄에도 적용이 되기 때문에 개별 증명서 또는 스케줄에 따로 서명할 필요가 없습니다.

만약 차압 고지서가 발급된다면, 세율은 고지서가 발급된 날로부터 최소 10일 후에 시작되는 첫 번째 달의 시작에 1%까지 증가합니다. 즉시 납부 요구 청구서가 발급되면, 세율은 안내문과 청구서가 발급된 날 이후에 시작되는 첫 번째 달의 시작에 1%까지 증가합니다. 
이 과징금은 미납 세금의 25%이상일 수 없습니다 귀하가 제 시간내에 세금을 납부하지 않은 타당한 이유를 갖고 있다는 것을 증명할 수 있다면 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 됩니다. 
**결합된 과징금.**
만약 미신고 과징금와 미납 과징금 (앞서 논의된) 둘다 같은 달에 적용된다면, 5% (또는 15%) 미신고 과징금은 미납 과징금에 의해 감소됩니다. 하지만 기한 일 또는 연장된 기한에서 60일 이상 경과후에 세금 신고서를 제출했다면, 최소 과징금은 $510 또는 미납 세금의 100% 중에서 더 적은 금액이 됩니다. 
**정확성 관련 과징금.**
다음의 이유로 세금을 과소 납부한다면, 정확성 관련 과징금을 납부해야 할 수도 있습니다. 
  * 귀하가 과실 또는 규칙, 또는 규정을 무시했을 경우,
  * 소득세를 상당히 과소 신고했을 경우,
  * 경제적으로 실체가 없는 거래에 대한 세금 혜택을 청구하거나, 또는
  * 해외 금융 자산을 공개하지 않았을 경우.


과징금은 과소 납부액의 20%와 같습니다. 과징금은 비공개된 비경제적 실체 거래 또는 비공개 해외 자산 거래에 기인한 과소 납부액의 40%입니다. [사기 과징금](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222625 "사기.")에 부과된 과소 납부액에 대해서는 이 과징금을 산정하지 않습니다. 뒤에서 다시 논합니다. 
_**과실 및 무시.**_
용어 “과실”은 세법을 준수하려는 합리적인 노력을 하지 않았고 신고서를 작성할때 일반적이고 합리적인 주의를 기울이지 않은 것을 포함합니다. 과실에는 또한 장부 및 기록물을 보관하지 않은 것도 포함됩니다. 귀하가 취한 입장에 대한 합리적인 이유가 있거나 또는 합리적인 사유를 증명할 수있고 성실하게 행동했을 경우, 과실 과징금을 납부하지 않아도 될 것입니다. 
용어 “무시”는 부주의, 무모한 또는 의도적인 무시를 포함합니다. 
_**충분한 공개.**_
귀하가 최소한의 합리적인 기준이 있는 입장을 신고서에 적절하게 공개한다면, 규칙 또는 규정 무시 과징금을 피할 수 있습니다. 이후의 [_공개 진술서_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222621 "공개 진술서.")를 참고하십시오. 
조세 회피에 기인한 항목에는 이 예외가 적용하지 않습니다. 추가적으로, 귀하가 적절할 장부 또는 기록물을 보관하지 않았거나 항목들을 증빙하지 못하면 이 예외는 적용하지 않습니다
_**상당한 소득세 축소.**_
귀하의 신고서에 나타난 세금이 정확한 세금보다 적다면, 세금을 축소한 것입니다. 만약 정확한 세금의 10%나 $5,000 중에 더 큰 액수가 축소됬다면 이 축소가 상당한 것입니다. 하지만 다음의 이유로 축소된 경우에는 축소된 액수를 경감합니다. 
  1. 실질적 권한, 또는
  2. 충분한 공개와 합리적인 기준. 
  3. 합리적인 사유와 성실성.


신고서의 항목이 조세 회피에 기인한 것이라면 충분한 공개에 대한 감면은 없습니다. 하지만 실질적 권한을 가진 입장에 대해서는 감면이 있습니다. 하지만 귀하가 세금 항목의 취급이 적절한 세금 항목의 취급일 가능성이 높다고 합리적으로 믿고 있었던 경우에만 해당됩니다.
_**상당한 권한.**_
해당 항목의 세무 처리에 대한 상당한 권한이 있거나 있었는지는 여부는 사실과 정황에 의거합니다. 법원 의견, 재무부 규제, 세무 통칙, 국세 절차 그리고 귀하의 상황과 같거나 비슷한 정황을 포함한 IRS 및 IRS 관보에서 발행한 안내 및 알림 등이 고려됩니다. 
_**공개 진술서.**_
항목의 조세협정에 관한 관련 사실을 충분히 공개하려면 양식 8275, ‘공개 진술서’를 사용하십시오. 귀하가 취급했던 항목에 대한 합리적인 기준이 있어야 합니다.
상당한 축소의 경우, 오직 [IRS.gov/irb/2024-52_IRB#REV-PROC-2024-44(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2024-52_IRB#REV-PROC-2024-44)에 나와있는 국세 절차 2024–44의 요건 (또는 후임)에 그에 맞는 항목들만 신고서에 충분히 공개된 것으로 고려됩니다. 
국세 절차 2024-44는 2024년 12월 31일 이후에 시작되는 과세연도에 발효된 세법 변경의 실효를 고려하지 않습니다. 이 국세 절차에서 언급하는 줄이 이러한 변경에 영향을 받았으며 추가적인 신고가 요구된다면 요건을 준수하기 위한 규제 또는 다른 지침이 발표되기 전까지는 양식 8275 또는 양식 8275-R, ‘규제 공개 증명서’를 제출해야 합니다. 
적절한 연도의 스케줄 UTP (양식 1120), ‘불확실한 세무 입장’에 나온 완전하고 정확한 세무 입장의 공개는 법인이 세무 입장에 대해 양식 8275 또는 양식 8275-R을 제출한 것과 같이 간주합니다. 하지만 양식 8275 또는 양식 8275-R의 제출은 법인이 스케줄 UTP (양식 1120)를 제출 한 것으로 간주하지는 않습니다.
양식 8275-R을 사용하여 규제와는 다른 항목 또는 입장을 공개합니다. 
_**경제적 실체가 부족한 거래.**_
경제적 실체에 대한 자세한 정보는 섹션 7701(o)를 참고하십시오.
_**해외 금융 자산.**_
해외 금융 자산 공개에 대한 자세한 정보는 6662(j) 를 확인하거나 양식 8938의 지침을 참고하십시오.
_**합리적인 사유.**_
만약 귀하가 타당한 사유 (합리적인 사유)를 증명한다면 항목을 취급한 방식에 대해 과징금을 낼 필요가 없습니다. 반드시 성실하게 행동했음을 증명해야 합니다. 이는 경제적 실체가 부족한 거래에는 적용되지 않습니다.
**오류적 환급 또는 세액공제의 청구.**
귀하가 잘못된 세액공제나 환급을 신청했다면, 과징금을 지불해야할 수도 있습니다. 귀하가 청구서를 제출한 합리적인 사유가 있다는 것을 증명할 수 없다면 과징금의 금액은, 불허된 청구 총액의 20%가 됩니다. 하지만, 경제적 실체가 부족한 거래로 인해 불허된 액수는 타당한 사유로 인한 것이라고 여겨지지 않습니다. 정확성 관련 또는 사기 과징금이 적용되는 불허된 청구 금액에 대해서는 이 과징금을 산정하지 않을 것입니다.
**경솔한 세금 제출.**
만약 경솔한 세금 신고서를 제출하거나 다른 경솔한 제출물이 있었다면 귀하는 $5,000의 과징금을 납부해야할 수도 있습니다. 경솔한 세금 신고서는 올바른 세금을 산정하기 위한 충분한 정보를 포함하지 않았거나 귀하가 신고한 세금이 상당히 부정확하다는 것이 분명히 증명되는 정보가 포함되는 경우입니다. 경솔한 세금 신고서, 경솔한 제출물 그리고 경솔한 것으로 판명된 입장의 목록에 대한 더 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov/irb/2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/irb/2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33) (또는 후속)을 참고하십시오.
귀하가 경솔한 입장에 기반을 둔 또는 연방 세법의 행정 지연 또는 교란을 목적으로 이런 종류의 신고서 또는 문서들을 제출했다면 과징금을 납부해야 합니다. 여기에는 귀하의 서명을 위해 제공한 공간 위에 기제된 언어를 바꾸거나 삭제하는 것도 포함됩니다. 
이 과징금은 법적으로 부과되는 다른 과징금에 추가됩니다. 
**사기.**
귀하의 신고서에 사기적인 세금의 과소 납부가 있다면, 사기에 기인한 과소납부의 75%의 과징금이 귀하의 세금에 추가될 것입니다. 
**TIN 미제공.**
신고서, 진술서, 또는 다른 서류에 필수적인 SSN 또는 ITIN 또는 다른 사람의 SSN이나 ITIN을 포함하지 않는다면, 각각의 미제공에 대해 $50의 과징금에 적용될 수 있습니다. 신고서, 증명서 등의 증명서에 필수적인 SSN 또는 ITIN을 다른 사람에게 알려주지 않으면 $50의 과징금이 적용될 수 있습니다. 
예를 들어, 이자가 붙는 은행 계좌를 소유하고 있다면, 본인의 SSN 또는 ITIN을 은행에 제공해야 합니다. 은행에서 귀하에게 보내는 양식 1099-INT 또는 기타 증명서에 이 번호들이 나타나야 합니다. 만약 은행에 SSN이나 ITIN을 제공하지 않으면, 귀하에게 $50의 과징금이 적용될 것입니다. (귀하는 또한 소득세의 예비 원천징수 대상이 될 수 있습니다.) 
귀하가 미제공에 대한 사유가 타당하며 의도적인 과실이 아니라는 것을 증명할 수 있다면 과징금을 납부할 필요가 없습니다. 
#### 형사 처벌
다음과 같은 행동에 대해서 형사 기소 (재판에 회부) 대상이 될 수 있습니다.
  1. 탈세,
  2. 고의적 세금 신고서 미제출, 정보 미제출 또는, 납부해야할 세금을 납부 하지 않음,
  3. 사기 또는 거짓 증명, 또는
  4. 사기성 세금 신고서 작성 및 제출.


## 8. 원천징수 또는 추정세를 통한 세금 납부
#### 소개
이 장에서는 귀하가 한 해동안 벌었거나 또는 받은 소득에 대한 미국 소득 세금을 납부하는 방법을 논합니다. 일반적으로 연방 소득세는 그때-그때-납부 세금입니다. 두 가지의 지속적 납부 세금 방식이 있습니다.
  1. **원천징수.** 만약 귀하가 직원이라면, 귀하의 고용주는 아마도 귀하의 급여에서 소득세를 원천징수 할 것입니다. 세금은 또한 특정 다른 소득에서도 원천징수 됩니다. 예를 들어, 연금, 보너스, 수수료, 도박 상금 등 각각의 경우 원천징수액은 미국 재무부에 귀하의 이름으로 납부됩니다.
  2. **추정세.** 귀하가 원천징수를 통해 세금을 납부하지 않거나, 원천징수 방식으로 충분한 세금을 납부하지 않았을 경우, 추정세를 납부해야 할 수 있습니다. 본인의 사업에 종사하는 사람은 일반적으로 이 방식으로 세금을 납부합니다. 귀하가 배당금, 이자, 임대료, 로열티 등의 소득을 받으면, 추정세를 납부해야 할 수도 있습니다. 추정세는 소득세 뿐만이 아니라 자영업세와 대체 최저세 납부를 위해서도 사용됩니다.

간행물 및 양식을 얻기 위한 정보는 [12장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100051142 "세금 관련 도움을 받는 방법")을 참고하십시오.
#### 외국인 신분 고지
귀하는 반드시 고용주에게 본인이 거주 외국인인지 비거주 외국인인지 알려서 고용주가 귀하의 급여에서 올바른 액수의 세금을 원천징수 할 수 있게 해야 합니다.
1장에서 논한 규칙에 따라 귀하가 [거주자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222118 "거주 외국인")이면, 반드시 양식 W-9 또는 비슷한 서류를 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. 이러한 규칙하에 귀하가 [비거주 외국인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222116 "비거주 외국인")이라면 반드시 고용주에게 양식 8233 또는 양식 W–8BEN을 제출하여 본인이 외국인 인것을 증명하거나 양식 W-4를 제출하여 귀하의 급여가 거주 외국인 또는 미국 시민과 같은 세율인 차등 세율 원천징수에 적용된다는 것을 증명하면 됩니다.
귀하가 거주 외국인이며 미국 내 출처로부터 급여 외에 소득을 받았다면 (배당금, 로열티 등) 양식 W-9 또는 비슷한 진술서를 원천징수 대리인 (일반적으로 급여 제공자)에게 제출하여 대리인이 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정)세율로 소득에 대한 세금을 원천징수 하지 않도록 합니다. 비거주 외국인으로서 이러한 유형의 소득을 받았다면, 양식 W-8BEN을 원천징수 대리인에게 제출하여 대리인은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율로 소득에 세금을 원천징수 하도록 합니다. 하지만, 소득이 미국 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결됐었다면, 대신 양식 W–8ECI를 제출하십시오.
#### 보수에서 원천징수
다음의 논의는 일반적으로 비거주 외국인에게만 적용됩니다. 거주 외국인의 세금은 미국 시민과 동등한 방식으로 원천징수됩니다.
직원으로서 수행한 서비스에 대해 비거주 외국인에게 지급된 급여 및 다른 보수는 거주 외국인 또는 미국 시민과 같은 세율로 차등 세율의 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 따라서, 귀하의 보수는 “급여”라는 용어가 법적으로 제외되거나, 또는 협정에 의해 면제가 아니면, 차등세율로 원천징수가 적용됩니다.
#### 급여에서 원천징수
귀하가 직원이며 차등 세율 원천징수에 적용되는 급여를 받는다면, 양식 W-4을 작성하도록 요구될 것입니다. 또한 양식 8233 ( [_조세협정 혜택에 자격이 있는 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222677 "조세협정 혜택에 자격이 있는 소득")에서 후에 설명할)에서 조세협정 원천징수 면제를 청구하지 않은 과거 또는 현재의 급여, 미래 서비스 그리고 장학금 또는 연구 지원금에 대해 양식 W-4를 작성하십시오. 이는 직원으로 그리고 장학금 또는 지원금 (또는 학비 감면)을 받는 조건으로 귀하에게 시행하도록 요구되는 서비스입니다.
비거주 외국인은 미국에서 비독립 개인 서비스를 시행한 직원으로서 받은 보수에 대한 양식 W-4 작성 시에 [공지 1392(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/notice1392)에 있는 특별 지침을 따라야 합니다. 비독립 개인 서비스에 대한 급여는 월금, 연봉, 요금, 보너스, 수수료, 보수성 장학금, 지원금 소득 및 이와 유사한 직원으로서 지급 받은 금액을 포함합니다.
귀하가 원천징수를 높이거나 낮추어야 할 필요가 있는지 확인하려면 [세금 원천징수 추정기](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator)를 사용하십시오.
만약 귀하가 서비스에 대한 보수가 아닌 미국 출처 장학금 또는 연구 지원금을 받았다면, 양식 W-4를 작성하는 방법에 대해 이후에 [_장학금 및 연구 지원금에 대한 원천징수_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222665 "장학금 및 연구 지원금에 대한 원천징수")를 참고하십시오.
**인도 출신 학생 및 기업 훈련생.**
미국-인도 소득세 협정 21(2)조의 혜택에 적격이라면, 귀하는 표준 공제에 대해 추가 원천징수 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
**가사 관리 직원.**
귀하가 가사 관리 직원으로 일했다면, 고용주는 소득세를 원천징수할 필요는 없습니다. 하지만, 귀하는 양식 W-4를 고용주에게 제출하여 소득세를 자발적으로 원천징수하는 것에 동의할 수 있습니다. 귀하의 고용주가 원천징수 시작함으로써 동의서를 받아들이면 동의서는 효력이 있습니다. 귀하와 고용주는 서면으로 서로에게 고지함으로써 동의를 종료할 수 있습니다. 
**농업 근로자.**
귀하가 H-2A 비자를 가진 농업 근로자인 경우 귀하의 고용주는 소득세 원천징수를 하지 않아도 됩니다. 하지만, 귀하와 고용주가 원천징수에 동의했을 경우에만 고용주가 소득세를 원천징수할 것입니다. 이 경우에 올바르게 작성된 양식 W-4를 고용주에게 제출해야 합니다. [IRS.gov/ForeignAgriculturalWorkers(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-agricultural-workers)에서 세금이 원천징수 되지 않도로 하는 것에 대한 더 많은 정보를 찾을 수 있습니다.
#### 원천징수로부터 면제된 급여
소득세 협정하에 미국 소득세로부터 면제되는 급여는 일반적으로 원천징수로부터 면제됩니다. 원천징수 면제 신청 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 [_조세협정 혜택에 자격이 있는 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222677 "조세협정 혜택에 자격이 있는 소득")을 참고하십시오.
미국 영토 사모아, 캐나다, 멕시코, 푸에르토리코 또는 미국 버진 아일랜드의 거주자인 외국인에게 지급된 급여는 원천징수에서 면제가 될 수 있습니다. 다음 단락에서 이 면제에 대해 설명합니다.
**수송 관련 직종에 종사하는 캐나다 또는 멕시코의 거주자**
자주 미국을 입국 또는 출국을 했던 특정 캐나다 또는 멕시코의 거주자들의 급여는 원천징수에 적용되지 않습니다. 이러한 사람들은 또한: 
  * 미국과 캐나다 또는 멕시코 사이에서 수송 서비스 임무를 수행하거나, 또는
  * 미국과 캐나다 사이에 접경 또는 미국과 멕시코 사이의 접경을 건너거나 접경에 의해서 지나는 건축, 정비, 또는 수로, 고가교, 댐, 교각의 건설에 연결된 임무 수행하는 사람들 입니다. 


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이러한 업종은 이 서비스가 철도를 위해 수행된 것이 아니라면 사회보장과 메디케어 세금의 원천징수에 적용을 받습니다._.
과세연도에 원천징수로부터 면제에 적격이기 위해, 캐나다 또는 멕시코의 거주자는 반드시 고용주에게 이름, 주소 그리고 TIN, 그리고 아래와 같이 선언하는 복사본 진술서를 제출해야 합니다. 
  * 미국 시민 또는 거주자가 아님,
  * 캐나다, 또는 멕시코 둘중 하나의 거주자입니다. 그리고
  * 해당 과세연도에 이전에 묘사된 의무를 시행할 것으로 기대합니다.


진술은 어떤 형식도 상관 없습니다. 하지만 반드시 직원의 서명과 날짜가 있어야 하며 위증할 경우 위증죄 처벌을 따르겠다는 자필 선언문을 포함해야 합니다. 
**미국 영토 사모아 및 푸에르토리코의 거주자.**
귀하 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코의 거주자이며 비거주 외국인 직원이면, 미국 또는 미국 영토 사모아 또는 푸에르토리코에 위치한 미국 기관의 직원이 아닌 이상, 미국 영토 사모아와 푸에르토리코에서 수행한 서비스에 대한 급여는 일반적으로 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다.
**미국 버진아일랜드의 거주자.**
미국 버진 아일랜드 실제 거주자인 비거주 외국인은 미국에서 일시적으로 고용되어 벌어들인 소득에 대해서 미국 세금의 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다. 그 이유는 이 사람들은 미국 영토 버진아일랜드에 소득세를 납부하기 때문입니다. 미국에서 번 소득의 원천징수를 피하려면, 미국 버진 아일랜드의 실제 거주자는 본인이 미국 영토 버진아일랜드의 실제 거주자이며 모든 소득에 대한 세금을 미국 버진 아일랜드에 납부할 것으로 예상한다는 내용의 편지를 복사본으로 고용주에게 보내야 합니다. 
#### 연금에 대한 원천징수
귀하가 미국으로부터 퇴직 연금 분배금을 받았다면, 이 분배금에는 일반적으로 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율의 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 하지만 1986년 이후에 미국에서 서비스의 수행으로부터 발생한 연금의 부분은 차등 세율로 원천징수 될 수 있습니다. 귀하에게 소득이 지급되거나 적립되기 전에 반드시 양식 W-8BEN 또는 양식 8233를 작성하여 원천징수 대리인 또는 지급인에게 제출해야 합니다.
#### 팁소득에 대한 원천징수
현 과세연도에 미국에서 수행한 서비스에 대해 받은 팁은 미국 소득세가 적용됩니다. 과세 대상 소득에 이를 포함시키십시오. 추가적으로, 한명의 고용주를 위해 일하는 동안 받은 팁이 한 달에 $20 이상에 이르면 차등 세율의 원천징수가 적용됩니다.
#### 독립 계약자
귀하와 귀하가 서비스를 제공하는 사람의 관계가 직원-고용주가 아니라면, 귀하의 급여에는 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율의 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 하지만, 과세연도에 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사한다면, 독립 계약자로서 개인 서비스에 대한 귀하의 (독립 개인 서비스)의 보수는 귀하가 IRS와 요구되는 원천징수액에 합의하면 완전히 또는 부분적으로 원천징수에서 면제될 수 있습니다. 독립 개인 서비스 보수의 원천징수에 대한 IRS과의 합의는 실질적으로 모든 당사자에 의해 동의가 된 후에 동의서에서 다루고 있는 지급금에 대한 효력을 가집니다. 귀하는 반드시 현 과세연도의 소득세 신고서를 적시에 제출할 것을 동의해야 합니다.
**중앙 원천징수 동의서 (CWA).**
만약 귀하가 미국에서 연예인이거나 체육 행사에 참가 또는 참여하는 운동선수인 비거주 외국인이며, 특정 요건들에 부합한다면 감소된 원천징수를 위해 IRS와 CWA 합의를 할 수 있습니다. 그 어떤 상황에서도 이러한 원천징수 합의는 예상되는 소득세 채무 총액 보다 원천징수된 세금을 낮출 수는 없습니다. 
양식 13930를 사용하여 역년의 현재 시점까지 미국 총 소득이 $10,000 이상인 비거주 외국인 연예인이나 운동선수에 대한 CWA를 신청하십시오. 양식 13930을 866–715–150 로 팩스를 보내거나 아래에 나온 주소로 우송해야 합니다. 
Central Withholding Agreement Program Internal Revenue Service 25520 Commercentre Dr. Lake Forest, CA 92630–8884
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_IRS는 CWA를 신청할 때 사용할 양식에 대한 소득 요건을 일시적으로 면제했습니다. 양식 13930-A는 현재 사용 불가능합니다. 면제 효력이 있는 동안, $10,000 미만의 소득을 가진 개인들은 양식 13930, ‘중앙 원천징수 동의서 신청 방법에 대한 지침'을 사용하여 CWA 신청을 해야 합니다. CWA 신청 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 양식 13930를 참고하십시오. 더 자세한 사항은_[IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Central-Withholding-Agreements(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/international-taxpayers/central-withholding-agreements)_를 방문하십시오._.
투어가 시작하거나 첫 번째 행사가 발생하기 전에 제대로 시행되는 것을 분명히 하기 위해 합의서가 효력을 발생시키기 45일 전에 CWA 요청이 반드시 IRS에 접수 되어야 합니다. 그리고 지침에 명시된 대로 모든 증빙 서류들이 반드시 포함되야합니다. 그렇지 않다면, CWA 합의를 고려를 하지 않을 것입니다. 예외는 상황에 따라 고려됩니다.
**최종 납부 면제.**
귀하의 독립 개인 서비스에 대한 과세연도의 마지막 지급금은 완전히 또는 부분적으로 원천징수에서 면제될 수 있습니다. 이 면제는 귀하의 과세연도 동안에 오직 한번 사용가능하며 보수의 최대 $5,000까지 적용됩니다. 이 면제의 (급여에는 적용되지 않음) 자격을 얻으려면, 귀하 또는 귀하의 대리인은 반드시 아래와 같은 진술서와 정보를 IRS 청장 또는 청장의 위임자에게 반드시 제출해야 합니다.

  * 귀하가 서명하고 그리고 위증시 처벌을 따르겠다는 조건을 증명하고 제출한 정보는 사실이며 납세자가 아는 한 어떤 관련 정보도 삭제하지 않았다는 진술.


만약 이 정보가 충분하다면, IRS는 해당 연도의 미국에서의 거래 또는 사업에 실질적으로 연결된 총 소득에 대해 잠정적인 소득세의 액수를 결정할 것입니다. 일반적이고 필수적인 사업 비용은 IRS청장이나 IRS청장의 위임자가 충족하도록 증명하였다면 고려대상이 됩니다.
IRS청장 또는 IRS청장의 위임자는 원천징수 대리인에게 원천징수에서 예외인 급여의 최종 지급의 액수와 면제에 의해 귀하에게 지불할 수 있는 액수를 보여주는 서신을 귀하에게 보낼 것입니다. 귀하는 반드시 이 편지 사본 두장을 원천징수 대리인에게 보내고 면제의 효력이 있는 과세연도에 대한 소득세 신고서에 편지의 사본을 첨부해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 515(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-515)를 참고하십시오.

**거주 외국인에게 지급된 사회보장 혜택에서 요류로 원천징수된 세금의 환급.**
법적 영주권자 (그린카드 소유자)에게 지급된 사회보장 혜택은 30% 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다. 미국 소득세의 목적으로, 그린카드 소유자는 그들의 법적 영주권 신분이 이민 법에 의해 박탈되거나 행정적으로 법적으로 취소되기로 결정되지 않는 한 계속해서 거주 외국인이 됩니다. 1장의 [_그린카드 테스트_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222120 "그린카드 테스트")를 참고하십시오. 귀하가 그린카드 소유자이고 해외 주소를 가지고 있기 때문에 사회보장 혜택에서 오류로 세금이 원천징수되었다면 원천징수된 세금은 IRS에서 환급됩니다. 환급을 받기 위해서, 반드시 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출해야 합니다. 납세자가 환급에 자격이되는지 확인하기 위해서 다음 주소로 신고서를 보내십시오.
Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Center Austin, TX 73301
또한 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 다음을 첨부해야만 합니다.
  * 양식 SSA-1042S, ‘사회보장 혜택 내역서'의 사본.
  * 그린카드 사본.
  * 다음의 내용이 포함된 서명된 진술서: “The SSA should not have withheld income tax from my social security benefits because I am a U.S. lawful permanent resident and my green card has been neither revoked nor administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned. I am filing a U.S. income tax return for the tax year as a resident alien reporting all of my worldwide income. I have not claimed benefits for the tax year under an income tax treaty as the resident of a country other than the United States.” (내가 미국의 법적 영주권자이고 나의 그린카드가 박탈되거나 행정적으로 또는 법적으로 취소되었다고 결정된 적이 없기 때문에 사회보장국 (SSA)은 사회보장 혜택으로부터 소득세를 원천징수하지 않았어야 합니다. 나의 모든 전세계 소득을 신고 한 거주 외국인으로서 해당 과세연도에 미국 소득세 신고서를 제출합니다. 저는 미국 외의 나라의 거주자로서 소득 조세협정에 따라 과세연도에 혜택을 신청하지 않았습니다.)


#### 기타 소득의 원천 징수
30% (또는 더 낮은 협정 세율)의 원천징수가 적용되는 기타 소득은 일반적으로 [4장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222302 "외국인 소득의 과세 방식")에서 논한 이자 (포트폴리오 이자가 아닌), 배당금, 퇴직연금, 연금 분배, 특정 매각과 교환으로부터의 소득이 포함됩니다. 또한 비거주 외국인에게 지급되는 사회보장 혜택의 85%가 포함됩니다.
**30% (또는 더 낮은 협정 세율)의 원천징수가 적용되지 않는 기타 소득.**
귀하가 소득의 제공자에게 W-8ECI를 제출하면 다음의 소득은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정 세율)의 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다.
  * 미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 소득 (보수 외). 
  * 귀하가 미국의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 것으로 간주되기로 선택한 부동산 소득. 이 선택에 대한 구체적인 사항은 4장에서 [_부동산 소득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222359 "부동산 출처 소득")을 참고하십시오.


파트너쉽 소득, 장학금, 연구 지원금에 대한 원천징수에 대한 특별 규칙은 다음에서 설명합니다.
#### 파트너쉽 소득에 원천징수된 세금
귀하가 미국 또는 해외 파트너쉽의 해외 파트너이면, 파트너쉽은 ECTI에 대한 귀하 지분의 세금을 원천징수 합니다. 귀하의 파트너쉽은 특정 파트너 레벨 공제를 고려하여 귀하의 지분의 원천징수를 감소 시킬 수 있습니다. 일반적으로, 이를 목적으로 귀하는 반드시 양식 8804-C를 제출해야 합니다. 더 많은 정보는 [양식 8804-C의 지침(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/Form8804c)을 참고하십시오.
실질적으로 연결된 소득중 귀하 지분의 원천징수 세율은 섹션 1에서 명시하고 있는 일반적으로 가장 높은 세율 (37%)입니다. 하지만, 귀하가 파트너쉽에 적절한 문서를 제출한다면 귀하에게 할당된 소득의 특정 타입에 대해 적용하는 가장 높은 세율로 원천징수 할 수 있습니다. 장기 자본 이득은 가장 높은 세율을 적용하는 특정 소득의 유형의 예입니다. 2024년 양식 1040-NR에 원천징수된 세금을 납부액으로 청구할 수있습니다.
파트너쉽은 원천징수된 세금을 증명하는 양식 8805의 내역서를 귀하에게 보낼 것입니다. 상장 거래 파트너쉽은 실질적으로 연결된 소득의 실제 분배에 대해 세금을 원천징수할 것입니다. 이런 경우에 파트너쉽은 양식 1042-S에 내역서를 귀하에게 보낼 것입니다.
**특정 파트너쉽 지분의 매각 및 교환 이익에 대한 세금 원천징수.**
귀하가 미국내에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사하는 (또는 종사하는 것으로 간주되는) 미국 또는 해외 파트너쉽의 직접 또는 간접 해외 파트너이며 이에 대한 지분의 직접 또는 간접적인 처분에 대한 이득이 있다면, 2017년 후에 발생한 양도의 경우, 양수인은 일반적으로 판매에서 실현된 액수의 10%에 준하는 세금을 원천징수해야 하며 귀하를 대신해서 IRS에 이를 납부할 것입니다. 해당 원천징수 및 납부 규칙은 미국 부동산 지분 판매의 규칙과 유사합니다. 귀하는 원천징수액을 반영한 양식 8288-A를 받을 것이며 이를 양식 1040-NR의 라인 25f에 신고하며 이득에 대해 납부해야 할 세금에 대한 세액공제로서 청구할 수 있습니다. 양수인에게 특정 정보를 제공하여 원천징수를 감소 시키거나 이를 제거할 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어 국세법의 비인식 조항이 양도에 의해 실현된 모든 이득에 적용되는 경우, 비인식 조항의 적용을 설명하는 통지를 제공한다면, 양수인은 원천징수를 하지 않아도 됩니다. 귀하가 원천징수를 하지 않은 양수인이라면, 섹션 1446(f)(4)에 따라, 파트너쉽은 귀하의 배당금에 대한 귀하가 원천징수를 하지 않은 금액의 세금과 동일한 금액의 (해당된다면 이자 추가 ) 세금을 원천징수 할 의무가 있습니다.
2020년 11월 30일에 재무부와 IRS는 [T.D. 9926(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2020-51_IRB#TD-9926)에서 (85 FR 76910), 비PTP 및 PTP 지분의 양도에 대한 섹션 1446(f) 하의 최종 규정을 발표했습니다. 이 최종 규정은 섹션 1446(f)에 따라, 원천징수에 대한 예외가 적용되지 않은 한, 파트너쉽 지분 (특정 PTP 지분이 아닌) 양도에서 실현된 금액의 10%와 같은 금액의 세금을 양수인이 원천징수 하도록 요구합니다. 이 규정들은 일반적으로 2021년 1월 29일 이후에 발생한 양도에 적용됩니다. 그러나, 공지 2021–51, 2021–36 국세관보 361에 따르면, 섹션 1446(f)(4) 하의 원천징수, 그리고 PTP 지분의 양도에 대한 규칙은 2023년 1월 1일 당일 혹은 이후에 발생한 양도에 적용됩니다. 추가적으로, 이 최종 규정은 재무부 규정 섹션 1.1446-4에 있는 PTP 분배에 대한 섹션 1446(a)하의 원천징수의 특정 조항을 개정했습니다. 또한, 공지 2021–51을 따르면, 이 개정들은 2023년 1월 1일 당일 혹은 이후에 발생한 PTP 분배에도 적용됩니다. 공지 2018–8 및 2018–29는 최종 규정의 효력 시작일 이전에 발생한 양도에 적용되거나, 혹은 이전에 설명된 것과 같이, 납세자가 이 기간동안 비PTP 지분의 양도에 대해 발의된 규정을 적용할 수 있습니다.
섹션 1446(f) 규정과 연관된 특정 사안에 대한 추가 지침은 [Notice 2023-8(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2023-02_IRB#NOT-2023-8)를 참조하십시오.
#### 장학금 및 연구 지원금에 대한 원천징수
[학위 수여 예정자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222295 "학위 예정자.")가 받은 적격 장학금에 대한 원천징수는 없습니다. 3장을 참고하십시오.
“F,” “J,” “M,” “Q” 중 하나의 비자를 가진 비거주 외국인 학생 또는 지원금 수령자이며 완전 면제가 아닌 미국 출처 지원금 또는 장학금을 받았다면 원천징수 대리인은 (보통은 장학금의 수여자) 서비스에 대한 급여가 아닌 지원금 및 장학금의 과세 대상 부분에 대해 14% (또는 더 낮은 협정 세율)로 원천징수합니다. 하지만, 귀하가 학위 예정자가 아니고 연구 지원금이 특정 요건에 맞지 않는다면, 세금은 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정)세율로 원천징수 될 것입니다.
서비스에 대한 급여인 장학금 또는 지원금에는 차등 세율로 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 이는 [_급여에서 원천징수_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222640 "급여에서 원천징수")에서 앞서 논했습니다.
#### 대체 원천징수 절차
원천징수 대리인은 양식 W-4를 작성할 것을 요청하여 대체 절차를 사용할 것을 선택할 수 있습니다. 원천징수를 줄일 수 있는 항목들을 아래에서 참고하십시오.
**비용.**
귀하의 신고서에서 공제 가능할 비용을 포함하십시오. 여기에는 5장의 [_공제_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222429 "공제")에서 논한 IRA 공제도 포함됩니다.
**비과세 지원금 및 장학금**
귀하는 미국 법 또는 조세협정에 따라 과세 대상이 아닌 지원금 및 장학금의 일부를 제외할 수 있습니다.
**표준 공제.**
미국-인도 소득세 협정의 21(2)조에 적격인 학생이라면, 표준 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 2024년 표준 공제 금액은 $14,600입니다.
**양식 W-4.**
양식 W-4의 적절한 라인들을 작성하십시오. 서명하고 날짜를 기입한 양식을 원천징수 대리인에게 제공하십시오.
장학금 또는 지원금에 대한 원천징수를 감소 또는 제거하기 위해 양식 W-4를 제출했다면, 이 양식에 청구된 공제가 허용되기 위해서 귀하는 반드시 연간 미국 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. 미국에서 한 과세연도 이상 체류하였다면, 귀하는 반드시 이전 연도에 미국 소득세 신고서를 제출했던 것을 시사하는 진술서를 연간 양식 W-4에 반드시 첨부해야 합니다. 만약 귀하가 신고서 제출이 요구될 만큼 충분히 길게 미국에 체류하지 않았다면, 요구될 경우 미국 소득세 신고서를 제출할 것이라고 진술한 진술서를 양식 W-4에 반드시 첨부해야 합니다.
원천징수 대리인이 귀하의 양식 W-4를 수용한 후에, 장학금 또는 지원금에 대한 세금을 급여에 적용하는 차등 세율로 원천징수합니다. 소득의 총액은 양식 W-4의 해당 금액(들)에 의해 감소하며 원천징수 세금은 나머지에서 산정됩니다.
귀하는 원천징수 대리인 (보통 지원금 수여자)으로부터, 과세대상 장학금 또는 원천징수 공제 금액을 제외한 연구 지원금, 세율, 및 원천징수된 세금을 표기한 양식 1042-S를 받을 것입니다. 연간 미국 소득세 신고서 작성을 위해 이 양식을 사용하십시오.
자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov/FormW4](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4)를 방문하십시오.
#### 조세협정 혜택에 자격이 있는 소득
미국과 귀하의 거주 국가 사이에 조세협정이 존재하며 귀하의 거주 국가가 면세를 제공하거나 또는 특정 소득 항목에 대해 감경 세율을 제공한다면 조세협정 원천징수 면제 혹은 낮은 원천징수 세율을 청구하기위해 귀하는 소득 지급자 (원천징수 대리인)에게 외국인 신분에 대해 고지해야 합니다. 일반적으로, 원천징수 대리인에게 양식 W-8BEN 또는 양식 8233 중 하나를 제출하여 이를 수행합니다.
개인적 서비스 소득이 아닌 소득에 대해 양식 W-8BEN을 제출하십시오. 다음에 논할 개인적 서비스 소득에 대해서는 양식 8233을 제출합니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_조세협정에 의한 면제에 적격이지만 원천징수 면제를 청구하기 위해 양식 8233을 원천징수 대리인에게 제출하지 않았다면 귀하는 여전히 양식 1040-NR을 제출하여 면제 햬택을 받을 수 있습니다. 양식 1040-NR의 라인 1a에 대한 지침을 따르십시오._.
**직원 및 독립 계약자.**
귀하가 직원 또는 독립 계약자로 개인 서비스를 수행했으며 조세협정을 이유로 개인 서비스 소득에 대한 원천징수 면제를 신청한다면, 해당 금액을 받게 될 각 원천징수 대리인에게 양식 8233을 제출하십시오. 
양식 8233을 제출했다고 하더라도, 원천징수 대리인은 귀하의 소득에서 세금을 원천징수해야할 수도 있습니다. 협정 면제가 기초하고 있는 요인들이 과세연도 말 이후까지 결정 가능하지 않기 때문입니다. 이 경우에, 과잉 원천 징수된 세금을 돌려받고 귀하가 협정 면제에 적격이라는 증빙을 IRS에 제공하기 위해 양식 1040-NR을 반드시 제출해야 합니다.
_**학생, 교사, 연구원.**_
학생, 교사 및 연구원들은 간행물 마지막에 있는 [부록 A (학생용)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222821 "부록 A-학생의 조세협정 면제 절차") 또는 [부록 B (교사 및 연구원용)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222839 "부록 B-교사와 연구원의 조세협정 면제 절차")에서 나오는 적절한 진술서를 양식 8233에 첨부하고 원천징수 대리인에게 제출해야 합니다. 부록의 목록에 나와 있지 않은 협정의 경우, 다른 협정에 대한 비슷한 형식의 진술서를 첨부하십시오. 
만약 귀하가 동일 원천징수 대리인으로부터 개인 서비스 소득 뿐 아니라 장학금 또는 지원금을 받았다면, 양식 8233을 사용하여 소득의 모든 두 가지 유형에 대해 조세협정에 기초한 원천징수 면제를 청구하십시오.
### 비고.
오직 귀하가 개인 서비스 소득에 대한 협정 원천징수 면제를 신청하는 경우에만 양식 8233을 장학금 혹은 연구 지원금 (보수가 아닌) 소득에 대한 면제를 신청할 때 사용할 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않다면 양식 W-8BEN을 사용하십시오. 
**특별 행사 및 홍보.**
음악 페스티벌, 권투 홍보, 그리고 기타 연예 및 스포츠 행사의 입장료 (TV 등의 수령액)로써 비거주 외국인 또는 외국 법인에 지급된 금액에 대해 원천징수 대리인이 IRS으로부터 달리 구체적인 안내문 서신을 받지 않았다면 총 30% 세율의 원천징수가 요구됩니다. 미국 총소득이 발생한 역년에 따라서 양식 13930을 사용하여 원천징수 감면을 요청할 수 있습니다. 조세협정의 조항에 의해 해당 소득이 과세 대상에서 제외되는 경우에도 원천징수가 요구될 수도 있습니다. 그 이유 중 하나는 부분 또는 전체적 면제가 일반적으로 과세 연도 마감 이후까지 결정될 수 없는 요인들을 기반으로 하기 때문입니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_IRS는 CWA를 신청할 때 사용할 양식에 대한 소득 요건을 일시적으로 면제했습니다. 양식 13930-A은 현재 사용 불가능합니다. 면제 효력이 있는 동안, $10,000 미만의 소득이 발생한 개인들은, 양식 13930 ‘중앙 원천징수 동의서 신청 방법에 대한 지침'을 사용하여 CWA 신청을 해야 합니다. CWA 신청 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 양식 13930을 참고하십시오. 더 자세한 내용은_[IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Central-Withholding-Agreements(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/international-taxpayers/central-withholding-agreements)_를 방문하십시오._.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_협정 면제를 잘못 신청한 소득에 대해서는 미국 출국 시 미국 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 보수에 적용되는 협정 항목에 대한 구체적인 내용은_[간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)_을 참고하십시오._.
**부동산 매각에 대한 세금 원천징수**
비거주 외국인이며 미국 부동산 지분을 처분했다면 자산의 양수인 (매입자)는 일반적으로 해당 자산의 처분으로 실현된 액수의 15%와 동등한 세금을 반드시 원천징수해야 합니다. 
하지만, 해당 자산이 거주 목적으로 매입자에 의해 취득되었고, 실현된 액수가 $1,000,000을 초과하지 않는다면 원천징수 세율은 10%입니다. 
실현된 액수는 다음의 합입니다.
  * 수령한 현금, 또는 수령할 현금 (원금만),
  * 양도된 또는 양도될 다른 자산의 공정 시장 가격, 그리고
  * 양수인이 수용하는 부채의 금액 또는 양도 직건 및 직후에 자산에 적용되는 모든 부채의 금액.


양도된 자산이 미국과 외국인의 공동으로 소유 자산이였다면, 실현된 금액은 각 양도인의 자본 출자에 기초하여 양도인들에게 배분됩니다.
주주의 미국 부동산 지분 매각 및 교환에 대한 이득으로 취급되는 QIE 분배금에는 21% 원천징수가 적용됩니다. 원천징수는 또한 국내 또는 외국 법인, 파트너쉽, 신탁, 부동산에 의한 특정 분배금 그리고 기타 거래에서도 요구됩니다. 이러한 규칙들은 [간행물 515(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-515)에서 그리고 양식 8288의 지침에서 다룹니다.
미국 부동산 지분 처분의 세금 처리에 대한 정보는 4장에서 [_부동산 이득 및 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222331 "부동산 이득 또는 손실")을 참고하십시오.
귀하가 국내 파트너쉽의 파트너이고 이 파트너쉽이 미국 부동산 지분을 이득에 처분했다면 해당 파트너쉽은 외국 파트너에게 배당되는 이득의 액수에 대한 세금을 원천징수해야 합니다. 귀하 소득 지분 및 원천징수된 세금은 양식 8805 또는 양식 1042-S (PTP 경우에)에 신고됩니다.
다음과 같은 상황에서는 원천징수가 요구되지 않습니다.
  1. 자산이 매입자에 의해 거주 용도로 취득되었고, 실현된 액수가 $300,000을 초과하지 않는 경우.
  2. 어느 한 법인의 어떤 주식의 종류가 기존 증권 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 경우, 처분하는 자산이 해당 국내 법인의 지분일 경우. 하지만, 상당한 양의 상장 법인의 비상장 지분 특정 처분의 경우, 이 예외는 적용하지 않습니다.
  3. 처분한 자산이 확립된 증권 시장에서 정기적으로 거래되는 미국 법인의 지분이 아니며 귀하 (판매자)가 구매자에게 지분이 미국 부동산 지분이 아니라고 증명하는 법인이 발행한 진술서의 사본을 제공했을 경우.
  4. 귀하 (판매자)는 양도자에게 위증죄의 처벌 하에 본인이 외국인이 아니며, 본인의 성명, 미국 TIN 및, 집주소가 포함된 진술서를 제공한 경우.
귀하는 이 증서를 대체인에게 제공할 수 있습니다. 적격 대체자는 구매자에게 위증의 처벌을 따를것이며 증서를 적격 대체인이 소유하고 있다는 진술서를 제공해야 합니다. 이 목적 상 “적격 대체인은” :
    1. 대리인이 아닌 사람으로써 거래를 성사할 책임이 있는 사람 (변호사 또는 타이틀 회사를 포함하여), 또는
    2. 구매자의 대리인.
  5. 구매자가 IRS으로부터 원천징수 증명서를 받았을 경우.
  6. 귀하가 구매자에게 국세법의 비인식 조항 또는 미국 조세협정의 조항으로 인해 양도에 대한 손익을 인식할 의무가 없다는 서면 통보를 제공할 경우. 구매자는 Ogden Service Center, P.O. Box 409101, Ogden, UT 84409로 반드시 이 통보의 사본을 보내야 합니다. 귀하는 이 서면 통보가 진실이라는 증명 및 위증죄의 처벌을 따르겠다는 서명을 해야 합니다.
양도자의 비인식 통보에 대한 자세한 정보는 규제 섹션 1.1445-2(d)(2)를 참고하십시오.
아래에 양도에 대해 귀하는 구매자에게 그 어떤 서면 통보도 제공해서는 안됩니다.
    1. 이득에서 제외되는 귀하의 주거주지의 매각.
    2. 전체적으로 비인식 처리에 적격이 아닌 동종자산 교환.
    3. 구매자가 필수적으로 양식 8288을 제출해야하는 시점까지 완료되지 않은 이연된 동종자산 교환.
대신 귀하는 반드시 원천징수 증명서를 받아야 합니다 (나중에 설명됨). 
  7. 미국 부동산 지분의 양도에서 실현된 금액이 0일때.

  9. 국내 지배 QIE에서 지급한 분배금이며 해당 설립체의 지분이 오직 해당 워시 세일 거래로 인해 처분된 이유로만 미국 부동산 지분의 분배로서 처리될 경우. QIE의 정의는 앞서 논의 했던 부동산 이득 또는 손실에서 [_적격 투자 회사_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222334 "적격 투자 설립체 \(QIE\).")를 참고하십시오. 4장의 _‘부동산 이득 및 손해’_ 에서 [_워시 세일_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222336 "Wash sale \(워시 세일\).")을 참고하십시오.


구매자가 (3)과 (4)에 나온 증명서가 사실이 아니라는 지식이 있거나 판매자 또는 구매자의 대리인 (또는 대체인)으로부터 이 증명서가 사실이 아니라는 통보를 받는다면, 구매자는 (3)과 (4)의 증서를 반드시 무시해야 합니다. 이는 또한 (4)의 적격 대체인의 진술서에도 적용됩니다.
**원천징수 증명서.**
자산의 처분 시에 원천징수가 요구되는 세금은 IRS가 발급한 원천징수 증명서에 의해 감경되거나 면제 받을 수 있습니다. 대부분의 경우 귀하 또는 구매자가 둘다 원천징수 이 증명서를 요청할 수 있습니다.
원천징수 증명서는 다음의 이유로 발급될 수 있습니다.
  1. IRS가 원천징수 감경이 다음과 같은 이유로 적절하다고 판단할 경우:

    2. 감액된 원천징수가 세금 징수를 위협하지 않을 경우.
  2. 실현된 이득의 총액이 미국 세금에서 제외되며 귀하에게 미납 원천징수 책무가 없는 경우.
  3. 귀하 또는 구매자가 세금 납부에 대해 IRS와 합의를 했으며 세금 채무에 대한 담보를 제공할 경우. 


원천징수 증명서를 요청하기 위한 절차에 대한 정보는 [간행물 515(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-515) 및 [IRS.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Withholding-Certificates(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/international-taxpayers/withholding-certificates)를 참고하십시오.
**원천징수된 세금에 대한 세액공제**
양도가 발생한 후 20일 내에 양식 8288을 사용하여 양도 세금을 신고하고 납부해야 합니다. 이 양식은 양식 8288–A 사본 A 및 사본 B와 함께 IRS에 제출됩니다. 이 내역서가 완전하고 귀하의 TIN이 기입되어 있다면 이 증명서의 사본 B는 IRS의 소인이 찍히고 귀하에게 (판매자)에게 반송됩니다. 원천징수 세금에 대한 세액공제를 받기 위해선 반드시 본인의 세금 신고서와 함께 사본 B를 제출해야 합니다.

양식 1042-S, 양식 8288-A, 또는 양식 8805에서 원천징수되고 신고된 세금에 대한 환급 요청을 처리하려면 추가적인 시간이 필요할 수 있습니다. 환급금의 발급은 최대 6개월까지 소요될 수 있습니다.
#### 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금
귀하가 미국에서 직원으로 일했다면, 대부분의 경우에 반드시 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 이 납부한 세금은 미국 사회보장 시스템 하의 귀하의 보장에 기여를 합니다. 사회보장 보험은 은퇴 혜택, 생존자 및 장애인 혜택 그리고 의료보험 (메디케어) 혜택을 특정 적격 요건에 맞는 개인들에게 제공합니다.
대부분의 경우에, 2024년에 미국에서 수행한 서비스에 대해 받은 과세대상 급여의 첫 $168,600에 사회보장 세금이 적용됩니다. 모든 과세 가능한 급여는 메디케어 세금이 적용됩니다. 귀하의 고용주는 이러한 세금을 각 급여에서 공제합니다. 고용주는 귀하가 사회보장 또는 메디케어 혜택에 적격이라고 예상하지 않는다고 하더라도 이 세금을 공제해야 합니다. 한 곳 이상의 직장을 갖고 있으며 그리고 귀하의 2024년 합산 급여에서 공제된 금액이 $10,453.20 이상이라면, 본인의 소득세 신고서에서 과잉 사회보장 세금에 대한 세액공제를 청구할 수 있습니다.
만약 어떤 고용주가 $10,453.20이상 공제했다면, 귀하는 해당 액수에 대한 세액공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 고용주에게 과잉액을 환급받으십시오. 귀하의 고용주가 과잉액을 환급하지 않는다면, 양식 843을 사용하여 환급 청구서를 제출할 수 있습니다.
일반적으로, 직원과 고용주 모두가 미국민이든 거주 외국인이든 상관없이 미국 사회보장과 메디케어 세금은 미국에서 직원으로서 수행한 서비스에 대한 급여의 지급에 적용됩니다. 제한된 상황에서 이러한 세금은 미국 이외의 지역에서 수행된 서비스의 급여에도 적용됩니다. 고용주는 귀하에게 사회보장과 메디케어 세금이 귀하의 급여에 적용되었다는 것을 말해 줄수 있어야 합니다. 귀하가 납부해야 할 세금이 없다면 자진 납세할 수 없습니다.
**추가 메디케어 세금.**
메디케어 세금에서 추가적으로 아래 액수보다 많은 메디케어 급여 또는 RRTA 보수, 자영업 소득에 대해 0.9% (0.009)의 추가 메디케어 세금이 적용됩니다.
  * 부부 공동 신고의 경우 $250,000,
  * 부부 개별 신고의 경우 $125,000, 또는
  * 그 밖의 모든 납세자 구분의 경우 $200,000.


추가 메디케어 세금의 목적으로 비거주 외국인에 대한 특별 규칙은 없습니다. 메디케어 세금이 적용되는 급여, RRTA수당, 자영업 소득에 적용 가능한 한계치의 초과분이 있다면, 이 또한 추가 메디케어 세금이 적용될 수 있습니다.
귀하의 고용주는 $200,000을 초과하는 메디케어 급여 또는 RRTA 보수에 대해 0.9% (0.009)의 추가 메디케어 세금을 원천징수할 의무가 있습니다. 만약 귀하가 공동 신고서를 제출을 할 계획이 있고 귀하 배우자의 개인 급여가 $200,000을 넘지 않을 것으로 예상되지만, 귀하의 급여와 자영업 소득의 합이 $250,000를 넘을 것으로 예상된다면 귀하는 양식 W-4에서 추가 원천징수를 요청하거나 추정세를 납부 할 수 있습니다.
만약 귀하가 양식 1040-NR을 제출한 경우, 급여와 자영업 소득의 총액이 기혼자의 경우 $125,000 (양식 1040-NR의 페이지 원의 상단에 부부 개별 신고 박스를 참고하십시오.), 미혼 또는 적격 생존 배우자의 경우, $200,000 (양식 1040-NR의 페이지 1의 상단에 미혼 또는 적격 생존 배우자 박스를 체크했다면.)이면 추가 메디케어 세금을 반드시 납부해야 합니다.
귀하가 추가 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 하는지 확인하기 위해 양식 8959와 그 지침을 참고하십시오. 추가 메디케어 세금에 대한 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov/ADMTfaqs(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-is-the-additional-medicare-tax)를 방문하십시오.
자영업 개인은 또한 추가 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 할 수도 있습니다. 이후의 [_자영업_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222694 "자영업 세금")을 참고하십시오. 
#### 학생 및 교환 방문자
일반적으로 이민 및 국적 법의 101(a)(15) 조의 하위 항목 (F), (J), (M), 또는 (Q)에 의거 비거주 외국인으로서 일시적으로 미국에서 비이민자 신분으로 수행한 서비스가 미국에서 입국 목적의 수행인 경우 사회보장 프로그램에 의해 보장되지 않습니다. 이는 귀하가 해당 서비스에 대해 받은 급여에는 사회보장 또는 메디케어 세금의 원천징수가 없다는 것을 의미합니다. 이런 유형의 서비스는 매우 제한적이고 일반적으로 학내 근로, 훈련시행, 경제난 고용등이 포함됩니다.
1장에서 논한 것처럼 [거주 외국인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222118 "거주 외국인")으로 고려될 경우 귀하의 이민자 분류가 (“F,” “J,” “M,” “Q”) 변하지 않는다고 하더라도 이러한 서비스에 대한 귀하의 급여에서 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금이 원천징수 됩니다.
“F-2,” “J-2,” “M-2,” “Q-3”의 분류에 속하는 비이민 외국인의 배우자 또는 미성년 자녀에 의해 시행된 서비스는 사회보장제도의 **보장** 을 받습니다.
#### 비거주 외국인 학생
귀하가 학생으로서 일시적으로 미국에 입국을 한 비거주 외국인이라면, 귀하는 미국에 체류하는 동안 일반적으로 급여나 연봉을 받는 일을 하거나 사업에 종사하는 것이 허가되지 않습니다. 어떤 경우에 미국에 “F-1,” “M-1,” “J-1”로 입국한 학생은 근로가 허락됩니다. 사회보장과 메디케어 세금은 학생이 거주 외국인으로 간주되지 않는 한, 급여에서 원천징수 되지 않습니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_학교에 등록됬으며 수업에 정규적으로 출석하는 학생의 학교에서 수행한 서비스에 대한 급여는 사회보장 메디케어 세금이 면제 될 수도 있습니다._.
USCIS는 “F-1” 비자로 온 학생이 미국 거주자의 자리를 박탈하지 않는다면 학내 근로를 허락합니다. “학내 근로”란 학교내에서 하는 일을 의미합니다. 학내 근로에는 교육적으로 학교와 연계된 학외 장소에서 시행된 작업도 포함됩니다. 장학금, 지원금, 조교직을 조건으로하는 학내 근로는 학업의 전체 과정을 듣는 학생의 교육 프로그램의 일부로 간주하며 USCIS가 허가합니다. 사회보장과 메디케어 세금은 학생이 거주 외국인으로 간주되지 않는 한 근로 급여에서 원천징수 되지 않습니다.
만약 비거주 외국인 학생에 의해서 시행된 서비스가 학생이 미국에서 입국한 목적을 시행한 것으로 여겨지지 않는다면, 사회보장과 메디케어 세금은 국세법에 의거하여 제외 되지 않는 한 서비스에 대한 급여로부터 원천징수됩니다.
#### 교환 방문자
교환 방문자는 이민 및 국적 법의 섹션 101(a)(15)(J)에 따라 일시적으로 미국 입국을 합니다. 교환 방문자가 거주 외국인으로 고려되지 않는 이상, 근로 허가를 받았거나 후원자에게서 인증 서신을 받은 교환 방문자가 제공한 서비스에 대한 급여는 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금을 원천징수를 하지 않습니다.
교환 방문자가 수행한 서비스가 방문자의 미국 입국 목적 이행을 위해 수해된 것으로 간주되지 않는 경우, 국세법에 의에 따라 급여가 면제되지 않는 한 서비스에 대한 급여로부터 사회보장과 메디케어 세금이 원천징수됩니다.
이민 및 국적 법의 섹션 101(a)(15)(Q)에 따라 국제 문화 교환 프로그램에 참여자로서 미국에 일시적으로 입국한 비거주 외국인은 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금에서 면제됩니다. 고용주는 외국인이 고용주를 통해 “Q” 비자를 받은 청구인이어야 합니다. 이 외국인이 거주 외국인으로 간주되지 않는 한 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금은 근로 급여에서 원천징수 되지 않습니다.
#### 실수로 원천징수된 세금의 환급
사회보장 또는 메디케어 세금이 적용되지 않는 급여에서 실수로 이 세금이 원천징수 되었다면, 환급을 받기 위해 세금을 원천징수한 고용주에게 연락하십시오. 귀하가 고용주로부터 총액을 환급받을 수 없다면, 양식 843에서 환급 신청서를 IRS에 제출하십시오. 다음 항목들을 양식 843에 첨부하십시오.
  * 원천징수된 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금의 액수를 증명하기 위한 양식 W-2의 1부.
  * 귀하의 비자 사본 1부.
  * 양식 I-94 (또는 출국 및 입국 일짜를 보여주는 다른 문서).
  * J-1 비자라면, 양식 DS-2019 사본 1부.
  * F-1 또는 M-1 비자를 받았다면, 모든 양식 I-20의 사본.
  * 선택적 실전 훈련에 참여했다면 양식 I-766를 첨부.
  * 귀하가 극심한 경제적 필요 사유로 고용에 참여 했다면 미국에서 고용을 허가한다는 것을 보여줄 문서.
  * 귀하의 고용주가 제공한 변제액 그리고 고용주가 청구 또는 귀하의 고용주에게 청구를 위임한 세액공제 및 환급의 액수를 보여주는 고용주의 진술서. 만약 귀하의 고용주로부터 이 증명서를 받지 못하게 되면 귀하는 반드시 본인의 진술서에 이러한 정보를 제공해야하며 고용주로부터 받은 증명서를 첨부할 수 없었던 사유를 설명하거나 또는 고용주가 환급을 해주지 않는다고 주장하는 양식 8316을 제출해야 합니다.
  * 그 해의 일부 기간동안만 사회보장 및 메디케어세에서 면제되었다면, 제외 기간에 납부한 세금을 증명하는 진술서를 제출해야 합니다.

#### 농업 근로자
H-2A 비자로 일시적으로 미국 체류를 하는 농업 근로자는 H-2A 비자와 관련되어 수행한 서비스에 대해 받은 급여는 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금이 면제됩니다. [IRS.gov/ForeignAgriculturalWorkers(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Agricultural-Workers)에서 세금을 원천징수하지 않게 하는 정보를 확인할 수있습니다.
#### 자영업 세금
자영업 세금은 자영업을 하는 개인에 대한 사회보장 및 메디케어 세금입니다. 비거주 외국인은 효력이 있는 국제적 사회보장 협정의 자영업 세금이 미국 사회보장 시스템에서 보장된다고 결정되지 않는 한 적용되지 않습니다. 이 목적으로 미국 영토 버진아일랜드, 푸에르토리코, 괌, CNMI, 또는 미국 영토 사모아의 거주자들은 미국 거주자로 고려되어 자영업 세금이 적용됩니다. [국제 사회보장 협정](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222699 "국제 사회보장 협의")에 대한 정보는 뒤에 설명합니다.
거주 외국인은 미국 시민에게 적용되는 같은 규칙에 따라 반드시 자영업 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 하지만, 국제 기관에서 고용한 거주 외국인, 외국 정부 또는 외국 정부가 전부 소유한 대행 기관에서 고용된 거주 외국인이 미국에서 벌어들인 소득에는 자영업 세금을 적용하지 않습니다.
귀하가 거주 외국인인 동안 받은 자영업 소득은 비거주 외국인으로서 수행한 서비스에 대한 소득이라도 자영업 세금에 적용됩니다.
**예시.**
빌 존스는 작가입니다. 빌이 외국의 시민 그리고 거주자 일때 몇 종의 책을 해당 국가에서 출간했습니다. 2024년 빌은 미국에 거주 외국인으로 입국하였습니다. 미국 거주자가 된 후에 그는 계속해서 해외 출판사로부터 로열티를 받고 있습니다. 빌은 본인의 소득과 비용을 현금 기준으로 신고했습니다 (소득을 받았을때 및 비용을 지출했을때 이를 세금 신고서에 신고함). 비록 빌이 비거주 외국인이였던 때에 출판된 책이지만 미국 거주자가 된 후에 받은 로열티는 2024년 자영업 소득에 포함됩니다. 이 로열티에는 자영업 세금이 적용됩니다.
**자영업 세금 신고.**
스케줄 SE (양식 1040)을 사용하여 자영업 세금을 산정 및 신고하십시오. 그런다음 스케줄 2 (양식 1040), 라인 4에 이 세금을 입력하십시오. 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)를 양식 1040, 1040-SR, 또는 1040-NR에 첨부하십시오.
**추가 메디케어 세금.**
자영업 개인은 반드시 (본인의 납세자 구분에 기초하여) 다음의 한계 액수 중 하나를 초과한 자영업 소득에 대해 0.9% (0.009) 추가 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 합니다.
  * 부부 공동 신고 — $250,000, 
  * 부부 개별 신고의 경우 — $125,000, 또는 
  * 미혼, 세대주, 또는 적격 생존 배우자 —$200,000.


만약 귀하가 급여와 자영업 소득이 둘 다 있다면, 추가 메디케어 세금이 적용된 급여액에 의해 자영업 소득에 적용되는 추가 메디케어 세금의 최대 액수가 감소합니다 (하지만 0 아래는 아닌). 자영업 손실은 이 세금의 목적으로 고려되지 않습니다.
만약 귀하가 양식 1040-NR을 제출한 경우, 급여와 자영업 소득의 총액이 기혼자의 경우 $125,000 (양식 1040-NR의 페이지 1의 상단에 부부 별도 박스를 체크) 미혼 또는 적격 생존 배우자의 경우 $200,000 (양식 1040-NR의 페이지 1의 상단에 미혼 또는 적격 생존 배우자 박스를 체크)이면 추가 메디케어 세금을 반드시 납부해야 합니다. 
귀하가 추가 메디케어 세금을 납부해야 하는지 판단하기 위해 양식 8959와 그 개별 지침을 참고하십시오. 추가 메디케어 새금에 대한 자세한 정보는 [IRS.gov/ADMTfaqs(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/what-is-the-additional-medicare-tax)를 방문하십시오.
**자영업 세금의 고용주 동일 부분에 대한 공제.**
귀하가 자영업 세금을 납부해야 한다면, 조정총소득을 산정할 때 납부한 자영업 세금의 일부를 공제할 수 있습니다. 이 공제는 스케줄 SE (양식 1040)에서 산정합니다. 
### 비고.
추가 메디케어 세금의 전액은 자영업 세금으로 공제되지 않습니다.
**추가 정보.**
자영업 세금 대한 자세한 정보는 [간행물 334](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-334)를 참고하십시오.
#### 국제 사회보장 협의
미국은 한 국가에서 커리어의 모든 또는 일부 기간에 고용된 직원의 사회보장 보험과 과세를 조정하기 위해 일반적으로 “Totalization agreement” (합산 협정) 이라고 하는 사회보장 협정을 해외 국가들과 체결하고 있습니다. 이 협의에 따라 같은 직업에 대한 이중 보험과 이중 기여 (세금)이 제거됩니다. 이 협정은 일반적으로 사회보장 세금 (자영업 세금 포함)이 오직 한 나라에만 납부되도록 명시하고있습니다.
현행 국제 사회보장 협정의 목록을 보려면 [SSA.gov/international/status.html(영어)](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/international/status.html)를 방문하십시오. 추가 국가와의 협정이 시행되면, 이 웹사이트에 올라올 것입니다. 국제 사회보장 협정에 대한 자세한 정보는 [SSA.gov/international/totalization_agreements.html(영어)](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/international/totalization_agreements.html)를 방문하십시오.
**직원.**
일반적으로 이 협의 하에, 사회보장 세금은 오직 귀하가 일했던 국가에서만 적용됩니다. 하지만 귀하가 같은 고용주를 위해 일하도록 일시적으로 미국에 파견되었고 귀하의 급여가 일반적으로 두 나라의 사회보장 세금에 모두 적용된다면, 대부분의 협정은 귀하를 파견한 국가의 사회보장 시스템에 의해 보장되도록 허용합니다.
협정 하에 귀하의 급여가 오직 해외 사회보장 세금에만 적용되고 미국 사회보장 세금 (메디케어 세금을 포함한)으로부터 면제라는 것을 성립하기 위해, 귀하 또는 귀하의 고용주는 적절한 해외 국가의 기관으로부터 특정 보장 증서를 요청해야 합니다. 일반적으로 해당 기관은 귀하 또는 귀하의 고용주가 해외 사회보장 세금을 납부한 같은 기관일 것입니다. 해당 해외 기관은 증명서를 발급하기 위해 어떤 정보가 필요한지 말해 줄 수 있을 것입니다. 귀하가 왜 미국 사회보장 세금에 예외인지를 여부를 증명하기위해 귀하의 고용주는 증서 1부를 보관하여야 합니다. 협정의 효력이 있는 날짜에 또는 이후에 받은 급여만 미국 사회보장 세금에서 면제될 수 있습니다.
### 비고.
미국과 협의를 맺은 일부 국가들은 보장 증서를 발급하지 않습니다. 이 경우에 귀하 또는 귀하의 고용주가 귀하의 급여에는 미국 사회보장 시스템에 의해 보장되지 않는다는 진술서를 요청해야 합니다. 보장 증서에 대한 더 자세한 내용과 신청방법을 보려면 [SSA.gov/international/CoC_link.html(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/international/CoC_link.html)을 방문하십시오. 
**자영업 개인.**
대부분의 협정 하에 자영업 개인은 본인이 거주하고 있는 국가의 사회보장 시스템에 의해 보장됩니다. 하지만, 일부 협정 하에, 만약 귀하가 일시적으로 사업 활동을 미국으로 또는 미국에서부터 이전한다면, 미국 자영업 세금이 면제 될 수도 있습니다.
만약 귀하의 자영업 소득이 오직 미국에 자영업 세금에만 적용된다고 생각하며 해외 사회보장에서 면제된다고 믿는다면 미국 SSA 에서 보장 증서를 요청할 수 있습니다. 위의 _비고_ 에서 링크를 참고하십시오. 이 증서는 귀하가 해외 사회보장 세금으로부터 면제된다는 것을 입증할 것입니다.
귀하의 자영업 소득이 오직 외국 사회보장세의 대상이며, 미국 자영업세의 대상이 아니라는 사실을 성립하려면, 적절한 외국 기관으로부터 보장 증서를 요청하십시오.
### 비고.
미국과 협의를 맺은 일부 국가들은 보장 증서를 발급하지 않습니다. 이 경우에 귀하의 자영업 소득이 미국 사회보장 시스템에 의해 보장되지 않는다는 진술서를 요청해야 합니다. 보장 증서에 대한 더 자세한 내용과 신청방법을 보려면 [SSA.gov/international/CoC_link.html(영어)](https://www.ssa.gov/international/CoC_link.html)을 방문하십시오.
면제가 되는 해마다 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 증명서의 사본을 첨부하십시오. 또한 “‘Exempt, see attached statement’” (면제됨, 첨부된 진술서 참조)를 자영업세 라인에 기입하십시오.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_협정의 보장 규칙에 대한 질문이 있다면, 410-965-7306으로 전화하십시오._.
#### 추정세 양식 1040-ES (NR)
귀하에게 미국 세금이 전혀 원천징수 되지 않은 소득이 있을 수 있습니다. 혹은, 원천징수된 세금의 액수가 그 해 말에 귀하가 납부할 것으로 추정했던 소득세보다 적을 수도 있습니다. 그렇다면 귀하는 추정세를 납부해야할 수도 있습니다.
일반적으로, $1,000 이상의 세금 납부가 예상되거나 원천징수와 특정 환급 가능한 세액공제가 아래의 액수보다 적을 것이라고 예상한다면 반드시 2025년에 대한 추정세를 납부해야 합니다.
  1. 2025년 소득세 신고서에 나타날 세금의 90% (0.90), 또는
  2. 2024년 소득세 신고서에 나타난 세금의 100% (1.00) (해당 연도의 12개월 모두가 포함되는 귀하의 2024년 신고서)


귀하의 2024년 조정총소득이 $150,000 이상이며 (2024년 납세자 구분이 부부 개별 제출이면 $75,000) 농업 또는 어업에 종사하지 않는다면, 위의 (2)에 100% (1.00) 대신 110% (1.10)를 적용하십시오. 2024년 신고서를 제출하지 않는다면 항목 (2)는 적용되지 않습니다. 
비거주 외국인은 양식 1040-ES (NR)를 사용해 추정세를 산정하고 납부해야 합니다. 수표로 납부하면, “United States Treasury” (미국 재무부)를 수취인으로 해야 합니다.
**2025년에 대한 세금을 추정하는 방법.**
2024년 세금을 양식 1040-NR로 신고했으며 2025년에 대한 소득과 총 공제가 거의 같다고 예상된다면, 2024년 신고서를 가이드로 사용하여 양식 1040-ES (NR) 지침의 추정세 작업표 작성을 하십시오. 2024년 소득세 신고서를 제출하지 않았거나 소득, 공제, 또는 세액공제가 2025년에 달라질 것이라면, 이 액수를 반드시 추정해야만 합니다. 2025년 양식 1040-ES (NR) 지침에 있는 세율 스케줄을 사용하여 본인의 납세자 구분에 맞는 추정세를 산정하십시오.
### 비고.

**수정된 추정세.**
귀하가 추정세를 납부한 후에 소득 또는 예외의 변화의 이유로 추정세가 상당히 증가했거나 감소했다면, 남아 있는 추정세 납부를 조정할 수 있습니다. 이를 위해서는 양식 1040-ES (NR) 지침 및 [간행물 505(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-505)를 참고하십시오.
**추정 소득세 미납에 대한 과징금.**
귀하는 특정 상황을 제외하곤 과소 납부 된 추정세의 분할 납부금에 대해 과징금이 적용될 것입니다. 양식 2210에서 이런 상황들에 대해 설명합니다. 
## 9. 조세협정 혜택
#### 소개
미국과 소득세 협정을 맺은 국가 출신의 비거주 외국인 (그리고 특정 거주 외국인)은 특정 혜택에 적격일 수 있습니다. 대부분 협정에서는 비거주 외국인이 협정 국가의 거주자여야 혜택이 청구되는 해에 자격을 갗출 수 있다고 규정합니다. 하지만 일부 협정에서는 특정 학생, 훈련생, 교사 또는 연구원의 경우에 해당 비거주 외국인이 미국에 입국하기 직전에 협정 국가의 거주자여야 한다고 요구합니다.
**조세협정표.**
[IRS.gov/TreatyTables(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/individuals/international-taxpayers/tax-treaty-tables)를 방문하여 조세협정 표에 접속할 수 있습니다. 미국 소득세 협정, 보충 협정, 세금 정보 교환 협정 (TIEA)을 체결한 텍스트 그리고 재무부 조세협정 기술 설명이 공개되면 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한 [Home.Treasury.gov/Policy-Issues/Tax-Policy/International-Tax(영어)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/treaties.aspx)에서 미국 모델 소득세 협정도 사용할 수 있습니다.

#### 협정 소득
비거주 외국인의 협정 소득은 조세협정에 의해 세금이 제한되는 총 소득입니다. 협정 소득에는 예를 들면 15%를 초과하지 않는 협정 세율의 세금이 적용되는 미국 출처의 배당금이 포함됩니다. 비협정 소득은 해당 조세협정에 의해 세금이 제한되지 않는 비거주 외국인의 총소득입니다.
감경된 협정 세율이 적용되는 소득 항목에 대한 세금을 산정하려면, 협정에 따른 해당 항목에 적용되는 감경된 세율로 각 개별 소득 항목에 대한 세금을 산정하십시오.
감경된 조세협정 세율이 적용되는 소득의 항목에 대한 세금을 산정하려면, 소득이 미국 내의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 소득인지 아닌지에 여부에 따라 30% 세율 또는 차등 세율로 세금을 산정하십시오.
귀하의 세금채무 금액은 협정 소득에 대한 세금 총액에 비협정 소득을 합한 금액입니다. 하지만 조세협정의 효력이 없는 것으로 산정했을 때의 세금채무 금액을 넘지는 않습니다.
**예시.**
아서 뱅크는 미혼이며 미국과 조세협정을 채결하지 않은 국가의 거주자인 비거주 외국인입니다. 그는 해당 과세연도에 미국 출처로부터 다음과 같은 항목으로 구성된 총소득 $25,900를 받았습니다.
조세협정에 의해 세금이 15% 세율로 제한되는 배당금 | _$1,400_  
---|---  
조세협정으로 제한되지 않는 개인 서비스에 대한 급여 | _24,500_  
**전체 총 소득** | **$25,900**  
아서는 해당 과세연도 동안에 미국에서 사업에 종사하였습니다. 아서의 배당금은 이 사업체와 실질적으로 연결이 없습니다. 아서는 공제가 없습니다.
조세협정이 실행되지 않았다는 가정하에, 사어의 세금채무는 $3,128로 산정됩니다. 다음과 같이 결정됩니다.
총급여 | _$24,500_  
---|---  
빼기: 공제 | _0_  
**과세 대상 소득** | **$24,500**  
차등 세율로 결정된 세금 (미혼 납세자에 대한 세금표) | _$2,708_  
더하기: 총 배당금의 세금 ($1,400 ×(0.30)) | _420_  
**협정이 시행되지 않았다는 가정하에 결정된 세금** | **$3,128**  
아서의 세금 채무금액은 조세협정에 의해 제공된 배당금 소득에 감소한 세율을 고려하여 산정하면 $2,930이며 다음과 같이 결정딥니다.
차등 세율로 결정된 세금 (위의 산정과 같음 ) | _$2,708_  
---|---  
더하기: 총배당금에 대한 세금(($1,400 × 15%) | _210_  
**급여와 배당금에 대한 세금** | **$2,918**  
아서의 세금 채무금액은 따라서 배당금에 대해 조세협정을 사용하여 산정된 채무금액인 $2,918으로 한정됩니다.
#### 전형적인 조세협정 혜택
다음 단락에서는 개인 서비스 소득, 송금액, 장학금, 지원금, 그리고 자본 소득 수익에 대한 조세협정 하에 제공되는 면제들에 대해 간단하게 설명합니다. 예외를 청구하기 위한 조건은 각 조세협정에 따라 다릅니다. 특정 조세협정의 조건에 대한 자세한 정보를 보려면 [IRS.gov/Businesses/International-Businesses/United-States-Income-Tax-Treaties-A-to-Z(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z)에서 미국 조세협정의 전체 문서를 다운로드하십시오. 다수의 해당 협정들에 대한 법적 설명 또한 이 웹사이트에서 제공됩니다. 또한 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)을 참고하십시오.
조세협정 혜택에는 또한 배당금, 이자, 임대료, 로열티, 퇴직 연금, 연금 분배가 포함됩니다. 이런 유형의 소득은 미국 세금이 면제되거나 감경된 세율이 적용될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)을 참고하십시오.
#### 개인 서비스
대부분의 소득세 협정하에 미국에서 서비스를 수행하기 위해 일시적으로 체류하고 있는 협정 국가 출신 비거주 외국인 및 협정 국가와의 타이브레이커 규칙에서 우위에 있는 이중 신분 거주자 ([1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?")을 참고)들은 이들에게 적용되는 협정 조항의 요건에 맞는다면 미국 세금으로부터 개인 서비스 소득의 일부 또는 전부를 면제할 수 있는 자격이 있을 수 있습니다.
**고용 소득.**
대부분 소득세 협정에는 “고용 소득" 또는 때때로 “비독립 개인 서비스"라고 불리우는 조항이 있습니다. 이는 협정 국가의 거주자가 다음의 모든 요건을 충족한다면, 미국에서 직원으로 벌어들인 소득을 미국 세금으로부터 제외하도록 허용합니다. 
  * 그들은 12개월 기간 동안에 183일 이하로 미국에 체류하는 경우. 
  * 해당 소득이 해외 고용주에 의해 지급된 경우. 
  * 해외 고용주의 미국 영구 시설에 의한 것이 아닌 경우.


일부 소득 조세협정에는 다른 최대 체류 기간과 같은, 다른 요건들이 포함되어 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)을 참고하십시오.
**독립 개인 서비스.**
일부 소득세 협정은 “독립 개인 서비스" 조항을 포함합니다. 이 조항은 미국에서 특정 일수를 초과하여 체류하지 않았고 정기적으로, 고정된 본부가 미국에 정기적으로 없었다면 협정 국가의 거주자들은 독립 계약자 또는 자영업 개인으로서 얻은 소득에 대해 미국 세금 면제가 허용됩니다.
### 비고.
일부 협정에는 독립 개인 서비스 조항이 없습니다. 이러한 협정들에 따라, 독립 개인 서비스 소득에 대해 사업 이익 조항이 적용될 수 있습니다. 사업 이익 조항에 따라 일반적으로 개인이 사업 이익이 기인한 영구적인 시설을 미국에 갖고 있지 않다면 사업 이익을 미국 세금에서 제외할 수 있습니다. “고정된 본부" 그리고 “영구적 시설물“이라는 용어의 정의를 포함한 더 자세한 내용은 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)을 참고하십시오.
#### 교사, 교수 및 연구원
여러 소득세 협정에 따라 대학에서 또는 다른 인증된 교육 기관에서 강의가 주된 목적으로 일시적으로 미국을 방문한 비거주 외국인 교사 또는 교수는 미국에 도착한 후에 첫 2-3년 동안 강의로 받은 보수에는 미국 소득세가 적용되지 않습니다. 또한 여러 협정들은 연구에 종사하는 경우에도 면제를 제공합니다.
일반적으로 교사 또는 교수는 반드시 미국에 가르치거나, 강의, 강연, 또는 연구에 종사를 주된 목적으로 미국에 체류해야 합니다. 개인의 시간의 대부분을 이러한 의무에 기울여야 합니다. 교사 또는 교수의 일반적인 의무는 정기적으로 계획된 강의, 시현, 또는 다른 학생의 참여 활동 등이 포함되는 공식적인 교실 근로 뿐 아니라 또한 비격식적인 세미나 또는 다른 비격식 단체에서 실험에 공동 참여 등에서의 아이디어 제시등이 포함이 됩니다.
귀하가 미국에 비거주 외국인으로 입국했지만 이제 거주 외국인이라면, 협정 면제가 여전히 적용될 수도 있습니다. 이후에 _거주 외국인_ 에서 [_거주자가 된 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222734 "거주 외국인이 된 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원")을 참고하십시오.
#### 외국 정부의 직원
모든 협정들에는 외국 정부의 특정 직원들의 소득에 대한 면제 조항이 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 혜택의 자격 대상에 관하여 협정들 사이에는 차이가 존재합니다. 여러 협정하에 미국 거주자인 외국인은 자격 대상이 아닙니다. 대부분의 협정하에 국적자가 아니거나 해외 국가의 시민이 아닌 외국인은 적격이 될 수 없습니다. 외국 정부의 직원은 관련 협정을 숙지하여 본인들이 혜택에 적격인지 판단해야 합니다. [10장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222746 "외국 정부 및 국제기구의 직원")에는 외국 정부의 직원에 대한 정보가 나와있습니다.
#### 학생, 훈련생, 및 수습 직원
일부 소득세 협정하에, 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원이 연구와 정비를 위해 받은 송금액은 세금으로부터 면제됩니다. 또한 일부 협정하에, 학생, 훈련생, 수습 직원이 받은 장학금, 지원금 그리고 제한된 수당의 액수는 세금이 면제됩니다. 귀하가 미국에 비거주 외국인으로 입국했지만 현재 거주 외국인이라면, 협정 면제가 여전히 적용될 수 도 있습니다. _거주 외국인_ 에서 이후에 [_거주 외국인이 된 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222734 "거주 외국인이 된 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원")을 참고하십시오.
#### 자본 이득
대부분의 협정은 개인적인 자산의 매각 및 교환에 대한 이득의 면제를 제공합니다. 일반적으로 미국에 위치한 부동산의 판매 및 교환에 대한 이득은 과세 대상입니다.
#### 거주 외국인
거주 외국인은 아래에 설명된 상황에서 조세협정 혜택에 대한 자격이 있을 수 도 있습니다.
#### 거주 외국인에 대한 일반적인 규칙
대부분의 조세협정은 마치 조세협정이 효력이 없다는 가정하에 미국의 시민과 거주자에게 세금을 부과할 수 있는 미국의 권리를 보존 또는 “저장"하는 “저장 조항"을 갖고 있기 때문에 거주 외국인은 일반적으로 조세협정 헤택을 받을 자격이 없습니다. 그러나, 여러 조세협정들에는 거주 외국인이 지속적 협정 혜택을 청구할 수 있는 저장 조항에 대한 예외가 있습니다.
일부 저장 조항에 대한 예외는 모든 거주 외국인들에게 적용됩니다 (예를 들어, 미국— 중국 협정에 따라). 그 밖의 조항들은 미국의 법적 영주권자 (그린카드 소유자)가 아닌 거주 외국인들에게만 적용됩니다.
특정 경우, 협정에 따라미국 세금에서 면제된 이유로, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 소득을 신고할 필요가 없습니다. 그러나 양식 W-2, 양식 1042, 양식 1099, 또는 그밖의 정보 신고서에 소득 항목이 과세 대상 소득으로 신고되었다면, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 적절한 라인에 신고해야 합니다. (예를 들어 양식 W-2, 박스 1에 신고된 임금 혹은 급여의 경우, 라인 1a). 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 청구하는 협정 혜택의 금액을 괄호안에 기입하십시오. “Exempt income,” (면제 소득) 협정 국가, 및 면제를 제공하는 협정 조항을 입력하십시오.
면제 대신, 협정에 따라 감소된 세율이 적용되는 소득의 경우, 감소된 세율로 산정된 세금, 협정 국가의 이름, 감소된 세율 적용을 허용하는 협정 조항이 나와있는 진술서를 양식1040 또는 1040-SR에 첨부하십시오. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 16에 세금을 입력하십시오. 박스 3을 체크하고 "Tax from attached statement." (첨부된 진술서의 세금)라고 입력하십시오.
**예시.**
미국-프랑스 소득 조세협정의 4조에 따라 미국의 거주자인 자크 두보아는 프랑스의 사회보장 혜택을 받습니다. 협정의 18(1)조항에 따라 , 프랑스 사회보장 혜택은 미국에서 과세 대상이 아닙니다. 18(1)조항에 의해 부여된 혜택은 협정의 29(3)조항하의 저장 조항으로부터 제외됩니다. 자크는 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 본인의 프랑스 사회보장 혜택을 신고할 필요가 없습니다.
#### 캐나다와 독일 사회보장 혜택에 대해 특별한 규칙
캐나다와 독일과의 소득세 협정에 따라, 미국 거주자가 캐나다 또는 독일에서 사회보장 혜택을 받는 경우, 이 혜택은 미국 소득세 목적상 미국 사회보장법에 따라 수령한 것 처럼 취급됩니다. 만약 캐나다와 독일로 부터 사회보장 혜택을 받는다면 과세 대상 금액을 결정해서 이를 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 6b에 신고하기 위한 목적으로 양식 1040 및 1040-SR 지침의 사회보장 혜택 작업표의 라인 1에 이 사회보장 혜택을 포함시켜야 합니다. 해당 혜택에 대해 양식 8833을 제출할 필요가 없습니다.
#### 거주 외국인이 된 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원
미국에서 연구 및 유지를 위해 해외로부터 송금을 받은 장학금, 지원금, 그리고 연구 지원금, 그리고 급여 및 기타 개인 서비스에 대한 수당에 대한 조세협정 면제를 청구하기 위해, 일반적으로 귀하는 반드시 비거주 외국인 학생, 훈련생, 수습직원, 교사, 교수, 연구원이어야 합니다. 거주 외국인이 되면, 일반적으로 더이상 그 소득에 대한 조세 협정 면제를 청구할 수 없습니다.
그러나, 미국에 비거주 외국인으로 입국했었지만 현재 미국 세금 목적상 거주 외국인이며, 협정의 저장 조항 (앞서 설명함)이 면제를 제공하며 귀하가 그 외 협정 면제 요건을 충족한다면 (아래에서 설명, [협정 면제 청구 기한](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222736 "협정 면제 청구 기한.") 적용) 협정 면제는 지속적으로 적용됩니다. 1장에서 설명한 것 처럼, 귀하가 [공동 신고서 제출을 선택한 비거주 외국인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")이라도 마찬가지로 적용됩니다.
만약 귀하가 협정의 구제 조항의 예외에 적격이라면, 귀하는 급여 제공자에게 양식 W-9 지침에서 요구하는 진술서와 함께 양식 W-9를 제출하여 소득 세의 원천징수를 피할 수 있습니다.
**협정 면제 청구 기한.**
여러 협정들은 협정 면제를 청구할 수 있는 연도 횟수에 제한을 두고 있습니다. 학생, 훈련생, 수습 직원의 경우 기한은 보통 4-5년, 교사 및 교수, 연구원의 경우 보통 2-3년입니다. 일단 귀하가 한도에 도달하면, 더이상 협정 면제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 협정 또는 적용되는 기한은 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)을 참고하십시오.
**세금 신고서에 소득을 신고하는 방법.**
특정 경우, 협정하에 미국 세금에서 면제된 이유로, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에 소득을 신고할 필요가 없습니다. 그러나, 양식 W-2, 양식 1042, 양식 1099, 또는 그 밖의 정보 신고서에 소득 항목이 과세 대상 소득으로 신고되었다면, 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 적절한 라인에 신고해야 합니다. (예를 들어 양식 W-2, 박스 1에 신고된 금액의 경우에 라인 1a). 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 청구하는 협정 혜택의 액수를 괄호안에 기입하십시오. “Exempt income,” (면제 소득) 협정 국가, 및 면제가 제공된 협정 조항을 입력하십시오.
**예시.**
중국의 시민인 거주 외국인 학생은 2020년 1월 1일 미국에 입국했습니다. 이 학생은 2024년까지 비거주 외국인이였고 미국과 중국— 소득세 협정의 20조항에 따라 그동안 미국 세금에서 장학금을 면제 받을 수 있었습니다. 2025년 1월 1일, 이 학생은 미국에 5년을 초과하여 체류하였기 때문에 상당한 체류 테스트에 따라 거주 외국인이 되었습니다. 이 학생이 이제 거주 외국인라고 하더라도 1984년 4월 30일짜 미-중 협정의 원안 2단락의 저장 조항에 대한 예외로 인해 20조의 조항들이 여전히 이 학생에게 적용됩니다. 이 학생은 양식 1042–S 또는 양식 1098–T에 표기된 장학금 소득을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 입력해야 합니다. “Exempt income,”(면제 소득), 협정 국가 및 면제가 제공된 협정 조항을 입력해야 합니다.
#### 청구한 협정 혜택 신고하기
국세법의 조항보다 우선 시 되거나 국세법의 조항을 변경하는 협정 혜택을 청구하여, 귀하의 세금이 감소하거나 또는 감소될 수 가능성이 있다면, 완전하게 작성한 양식 8833을 귀하의 세금 신고서에 첨부해야 합니다. 아래의 [_예외_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222741 "예외.")에서 양식 8833을 제출하지 않아도 되는 경우를 참고하십시오.
**양식 8833 제출 요건.**
다음의 협정 혜택 중 하나를 청구한다면 미국 세금 신고서와 양식 8833을 반드시 제출해야 합니다.
  * 협정에 기초하여 미국 부동산 지분의 처분 손익에 대해 과세표준 감경 또는 조정을 청구하는 경우.
  * 국세법에 의해 허용되지 않을 해외 세금 세액공제에 대해 특정 해외 세금에 대한 세액공제를 청구한 경우.
  * 귀하가 총액 $100,000을 초과하는 지급금 또는 소득 항목을 수령했으며 [1장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222114 "비거주 외국인인가 아니면 거주 외국인인가?")에서 논한 거주 규칙이 아닌 협정에 따라, 본인의 거주 국가를 결정했을 경우.


이는 양식 8833이 요구되는 흔한 경우입니다. 추가적인 조항은 양식 8833의 지침을 참고하십시오.
**예외.**
다음과 같은 경우에는 양식 8833을 제출할 필요가 없습니다. 
  1. 원래는 30% 세율이 적용되는 이자, 배당금, 임대료, 로열티, 또는 다른 FDAP 소득에 대해 협정에 따라 감경된 원천징수 세율을 청구할 경우.

## 10. 외국 정부 및 국제기구의 직원
#### 소개
외국 정부 직원 (외국 정부의 정치 구역 포함)은 다음 한 요건을 충족한다면 외국 정부의 급여를 미국 세금에서 면제할 수도 있습니다.
  1. 다자간 외교 관계에 대한 비엔나 협정에서 적용 가능한 조항, 다자간 영사 관계에 대한 비엔나 협정 또는 양자 영사 협정, 중 하나가 미국과 해당 외국 국가 간에 존재하는 경우,
  2. 미국과 외국 국가간에 양자 조세협정에 적용 가능한 조항이 존재하는 경우, 또는
  3. 외국 정부 임금에 대한 미국 소득세 면제 요건이 미국 세법에 규정되어 있는 경우.


국제기구를 창설한 국제 협정에 면제 조항이 존재하거나, 미국 세법에 따라 해당 임금에 대한 면제를 받기 위한 요건을 충족함으로써 임금을 면제할 수 있습니다.
“국제기구 ”란 국제기구 면제 법에서 제공하는 특혜, 예외, 면책의 자격이 있으며, 미국 대통령의 행정 명령을 통해 지정된 기구입니다.
이 장에서 논하는 면제는 외국 정부 또는 국제기구에 제공한 공식 서비스에 대해 받게 되는 급여에 대해서만 적용됩니다. 이 면제에 적격인 사람의 기타 미국 출처 소득은 완전히 과세 대상이거나 또는 해당 조세협정 항목에 따라 우호적인 취급을 받을 수 있습니다. 이런 종류의 소득 (이자, 배당 등)의 올바른 취급은 이 간행물의 앞에서 다루었습니다.

#### 외국 정부의 직원
**비엔나 협정 또는 양자간 영사 협정에 따른 면제.**
비엔나 협정 또는 양자간 영사 협정에 세금 면제 조항이 하나라도 있다면 귀하의 급여가 이 조항에 의해 미국 소득 세금 면제에 적격 여부를 알아봐야 합니다. 귀하가 미국 신민 또는 거주자라면, 일반적으로 비엔나 협정 또는 양자간 영사 협정하의 소득세 면제의 자격 대상이 아닙니다. 비엔나 협정과 양자 영사 협정에 대한 자세한 정보를 알아보려면 해외 영사관 주 사무소의 부서 이메일 OFMAssistants@state.gov(영어)로 보내십시오.
**조세협정에 따른 면제.**
만약 납세자가 비엔나 협정이나 양자간 영사 협정에서 제공하는 면제에는 적격하지 않지만, 미국과 조세협정을 맺은 나라의 출신이라면 납세자는 미국 세금으로부터 급여를 면제로 하는 조항이 있는지 찾기 위해 해당 조세협정을 확인해야 합니다. 만약 귀하가 외국 정부를 위해 미국에서 일하는 미국 시민이거나 거주자라면 귀하의 급여는 면제되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 [간행물 901(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/forms-pubs/about-publication-901)에서 _‘외국 정부가 지급한 급여 및 퇴직연금’_ 을 참고하십시오.
**미국 세법에 따른 면제.**
비엔나 협정, 양자간 영사 협정, 또는 조세협정의 어느 세금 면제 조항에도 적격이 아닌 외국 정부의 직원은 미국 세법에 따라 급여 면제를 받는 다음의 요건을 충족한다면 외국 정부 급여가 미국 소득세에서 면제될 수도 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_미국 세법 하의 면제는 오직 현재 외국 정부 직원에게만 적용되고 이전 직원에게는 적용되지 않습니다. 미국에 살고 있는 외국 정부의 전 직원이 받고 있는 퇴직 연금은 여기에서 논하는 면제에 적격이 아닙니다._.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이 면제는 독립 계약자에게 적용되지 않습니다. 귀하가 직원인지 아니면 독립 계약자인지를 결정할때 관습법 규칙이 적용됩니다._[간행물 1779(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1779.pdf)_, 그리고_[간행물 15-A(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-15-a)_를 참고하십시오._.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_만약 귀하가 “규제되는 상업 설립체”에 의해 고용되었거나 또는 본인의 서비스가 주로 외국 정부의 (미국 내외의) 상업 활동과 연관이 있다면 귀하의 급여는 미국 세법에 따른 면제에 대해 적격이 아닙니다. 규제되는 상업 설립체는 외국 정부가 50% (0.50)이상 소유한 미국 국내외에서 상업적인 활동에 종사하는 설립체입니다._.
**요건.**
귀하가 미국 시민이 아니며 (또는 미국 시민이지만 또한 필리핀 국민이라면) 미국 내에서 외국 정부를 위해 일한다면, 귀하의 외국 정부 급여는 다음과 같은 경우 미국 소득세로부터 면제됩니다.
  1. 귀하가 외국 정부에서 미국 정부의 직원에 의해서 시행되는 것과 비슷한 특성의 서비스를 수행할 경우, 그리고
  2. 귀하의 외국 정부 고용주의 국가가 해당 국가에서 비슷한 서비스를 시행한 미국 정부 직원에게 동등한 세금 면제를 수여할 때. 


이 면제의 적격성에 영향을 줄 수 있는 특별한 규칙을 알아보려면, [_이민자 (법적 영주권) 신분을 유지하고 있는 외국인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100078101 "이민자 신분 \(법적 영주권자\)을 유지하고 있는 외국인.")을 이후에 참고하십시오.
세금 면제를 청구하려면, 귀하가 반드시 반드시 미국 세법 요건을 모두를 충족 시키고 있다는 것을 증명할 수 있어야 합니다.
**증서.**
유사한 서비스 및 동등한 세금 면제 요건을 충족했으나 미국 세금 법 면제에 적격할 필요가 없다는 것을 확립할 가장 간단한 방법은 국무부 증서를 발급을 받는 것입니다. 증서 발급 여부 및 이 증서가 현재 유효하고 귀하에게 적용 가능 여부를 알아보려면, OFMAssistants@state.gov(영어)로 해외 업무 국무부실에 이메일을 보내십시오.
유효한 증서가 존재하지 않는 경우, 외국에서 미국 정부의 직원이 수행하는 임무와 비슷한 성격의 임무를 수행했다는 것과 외국 정부 고용주의 국가가 해당 국가에서 유사한 임무를 수행한 미국 정부 직원에게 동등한 면제를 부여 했다는 것을 다룬 서면 증거로 입증해야 합니다.
####  국제기구의 직원
**국제기구 협정에 따른 면제.**
국제기구를 설립한 많은 협정들은 미국 소득세로부터 귀하의 급여를 면제할 수 있다는 조항을 포함하고 있습니다. 만약 귀하가 미국 내의 국제기구에 고용 되었다면, 우선 본인이 일하는 국제기구를 설립한 국제 협정에 이러한 조항이 있는지 여부와 이에 본인이 적격인지 여부를 확인해야 합니다. 일반적으로 이런 조항들은 미국 시민과 거주자 직원의 급여는 면제하지 않습니다.
**미국 세법에 따른 예외.**
만약 본인이 일하는 국제기구를 설립한 국제 협정이 세금 면제 조항을 포함하지 않으며 귀하가 미국 시민이 아니라면 (또는 미국 시민이지만 또한 필리핀 국민이라면), 미국 세법에 따라 급여가 면제될 수도 있습니다. 이 면제의 적격성에 영향을 줄 수 있는 특별한 규칙을 알아보려면, [_이민자 신분 (법적 영주권)을 유지하고 있는 외국인_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink100078101 "이민자 신분 \(법적 영주권자\)을 유지하고 있는 외국인.")을 이후에 참고하십시오.

면제를 청구하기 위해, 반드시 본인이 국제기구 협정 항목이나 미국 세법 항목의 요건을 충족한다는 것을 증명할 수 있어야 합니다. 존재한다면, 국제기구 협정 세금 예외 조항의 번호 그리고 국제기구로서 해당 기구를 지정한 행정 명령의 번호를 알아야 합니다. 
**이민자 신분 (법적 영주권자)을 유지하고 있는 외국인.**
합법적인 영주권 신분 (그린 카드) 을 유지하기 위해 이민 및 국적법 (USCIS 양식 I-508) 섹션 247 (b) 에 규정된 포기조항에 서명하는 경우, 포기 조항 신고일로부터 더 이상 미국 세법에 따라 면세 혜택을 받을 수 없습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_영주권을 소지한 외국 정부 또는 국제기구의 직원인 경우, 미국 세법에 따라 면제를 신청하려면, USCIS 양식 I-508을 서명 및 제출하지 않았음을 USCIS로 부터 받은 서면 증거를 통해 증명할 수 있어야 합니다._.
### 비고.
양식 I-508의 제출은 미국 세법의 조항에 적용받지 않는 세금 면제에는 영향을 미치지 않습니다. 귀하가 포기서류를 제출하고 다음의 조건 중 어느 것이라도 충족한다면, 세금 면제가 유지됩니다.
  * 귀하가 외국 정부에서 일하고 있고 미국과 귀하의 외국 정부 고용주 간 소득세 협정, 영사관 협정, 비엔나 협정 또는 그 밖의 국제 협정에 따라 미국 세금으로부터 면제인 경우. 
  * 귀하가 국제기구에서 일하고 있으며 해당 국제기구를 설립한 국제 협정에서 외국 직원은 미국 세금에서 면제가 된다는 내용을 제공한 경우. 그러한 조항을 가진 두 개의 국제기구는 국제 통화 기구 (IMF)와 국제 부흥 개발 은행 (세계 은행)입니다.

양식 2063으로부터 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 분리하여 당해 연도 동안에 모든 출국일에 대해 사용할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이후에 IRS가 귀하의 출국으로 소득세 징수가 위태로울 수 있다고 믿는다면 이후의 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 취소할 수도 있습니다.
#### 양식 1040-C
만약 귀하가 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 반드시 받아야 하고 양식 2063의 제출에 적격하지 않다면 반드시 양식 1040-C를 제출해야 합니다.
일반적으로, 과세연도 동안에 출국일까지 (출국일 포함) 받은 모든 소득 또는 합리적으로 받을 거라고 예상되는 소득은 반드시 양식 1040-C에 신고되야 하며 이에 대한 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 양식 1040-C에 나온 세금을 납부했고 이전 연도의 모든 신고서를 제출했으며 납부해야 할 모든 세금을 납부했다면, 귀하는 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 받을 것입니다. 하지만, IRS는 귀하가 특정 연도 세금 납부하는 대신 납부를 보증할 채권 제공을 허가할 수 있습니다. 이후에 논의할 [_납부 보증 채권_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222787 "납부 보증 채권")을 참고하십시오. 이 단락의 조건에 따라 발급된 출항 또는 출국 허가증은 발급된 특정 출국에 대해서만 적용됩니다.
**미국으로 돌아오기.**
귀하가 미국에 돌아올 의향이 있다는 것과 귀하의 출국이 세금 징수를 저해하게 하지 않을 것이라는 점을 증명할 수 있는 IRS가 충족할 정보를 제공하면, 귀하는 양식 1040-C를 제출하여 이 양식에 나온 세금을 납부하지 않고 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 받을 수 있습니다. 하지만, 아직 제출하지 않은 모든 필수 소득세 신고서를 제출해야만 합니다. 그리고 이런 신고서에 납부하도록 하는 모든 소득 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 
귀하의 양식 1040-C에는 출국 연도 전체 동안 벌어들인 또는 합리적으로 벌어들일 것으로 예측하는 모든 소득을 반드시 포함해야 합니다. 양식 1040으로 발급 받은 출항 또는 출국 허가증은 당해 년도 전체에 모든 출국에 대해 사용될 수 있습니다. 하지만 이후에 IRS가 귀하의 출국으로 소득세 납부가 위태저해로울 수 있다고 보인다면 이후의 출항 또는 출국 허가증을 취소할 수도 있습니다. 
**양식 1040-C 공동 신고서.**
출국하는 비거주 외국인 부부는 공동 신고서 제출을 할 수 없습니다. 하지만 다음과 같은 경우 두 배우자 둘다 거주 외국인이라면 양식 1040-C를 공동으로 제출할 수 있습니다. 
  * 두 배우자가 일반적인 과세연도의 말에 공동 신고서를 제출이 적격일 것이라고 합리적으로 예측할 수 있는 경우, 그리고
  * 두 배우자의 과세연도가 같은 기간에 끝나는 경우.


#### 세금 납부 및 환급 받기
담보가 제공될 경우 또는 IRS가 귀하의 출국이 소득세 징수가 저해된지 않는다고 확신할 때를 제외하곤 양식 1040-C 제출 시에 나온 모든 세금 책무를 반드시 납부해야 합니다. 과거 연도에 대한 미납 세금을 모두 납부해야 합니다. 양식 1040-C에 세금 산정의 결과가 과다납부라면, 신고서 제출시에 납부해야 할 세금은 없습니다. 하지만 IRS는 출국시에 환급을 제공할 수 없습니다. 만약 귀하에게 받을 환급이 있다면, 과세연도 말에 양식 1040-NR을 반드시 제출해야 합니다. 
#### 납부 보증 채권
일반적으로 양식 1040-C 제출시에 해당 양식에 나온 세금 책무를 반드시 납부해야 합니다. 하지만 이전 연도에 납부해야 할 모든 세금을 납부했고, 양식 1040–C 또는 세금 신고서 제출 마감일이 만료되지 않았다면 이전 연도의 세금 신고서에 대한 세금을 납부하는 대신 납부 보장 채권을 제공할 수 있습니다.
이 채권은 반드시 납부 일까지 IRS가 산정한 세금 및 이자와 동일해야 합니다. 채권 및 이에 대한 담보 양식에 대한 정보는 TAC 사무소에서 받을 수 있습니다.
#### 연간 미국 소득세 신고서 제출
양식 1040-C는 연간 미국 소득세 신고서가 아닙니다. 양식 1040-C는 이미 제출되었다고 하더라도 소득세 신고서가 법적으로 요구된다면 반드시 소득세 신고서를 제출해야 합니다. [5장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222401 "세금 산정하기 ") 및 [7장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222581 "신고 정보")에서 연간 미국 소득세 신고서 제출에 대해 논합니다. 양식 1040-C에 대해 납부된 세금은 귀하의 연간 미국 소득세 신고서의 전체 연도의 세금채무에 대한 세액공제로 취급해야 합니다.

|  **세금 목적상 거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인의 차이는 무엇입니까?**  
|  세금 목적으로 외국인은 미국 시민이 아닌 사람입니다. 외국인은 거주 외국인과 비거주 외국인으로 분류됩니다. 거주 외국인은 미국 시민과 똑같이 전세계로부터의 소득이 과세 대상입니다. 비거주 외국인은 미국 출처 소득 그리고 미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결된 특정 외국 출처 소득만 과세됩니다. 이 두 범주의 차이점은 실질적으로 연결된 소득은 허용 공제 후에 차등 세율에 따라 과세된다는 점 입니다. 이는 미국 시민과 거주자에게 적용되는 세율과 같습니다. 실질적으로 연결되지 않은 소득은 고정 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율로 과세됩니다. 용어 “면제 개인”은 미국 세금으로부터 면제 대상인 사람을 의미하지 않습니다. 미국에서 F 비자로 학생으로서 일시적으로 체류했던 이유로 [상당한 체류 테스트](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222128 "상당한 체류 테스트")에 따라서 귀하가 거주 외국인인지 여부를 판단하기 위해 처음 5년동안은 학생으로 미국에 체류였던 일수를 산정 할 필요가 없기 때문에 “면제 개인”으로 불립니다. 1장을 참고하십시오. 일반적으로, 거주 외국인으로서 조세협정 혜택을 청구할 수 없습니다. 하지만 예외가 있습니다. 1장에 [_조세협정의 효력_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222158 "조세협정의 효력")을 참고하십시오. 또한 9장의 일부 전형적인 조세협정 혜택에서 [_거주자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222729 "거주 외국인")를 참고하십시오. 귀하가 미국에서 거래 또는 사업에 종사했거나 또는 원천징수된 액수에 의해 세금이 완전히 납부되지 않은 미국 출처 소득을 갖고 있다면 반드시 양식 1040-NR을 제출해야 합니다. 귀하는 지난 해에 이중 신분 외국인이였습니다. 귀하가 미국에서 183일 이상 체류했기 때문에, 일반적인 규칙에 따라, 상당한 체류 테스트를 충족하여 거주 외국인으로써 과세됩니다. 그러나 미국에 체류하지 않았던 기간 동안에는 비거주 외국인입니다. 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR를 제출하십시오. “Dual-Status Return” (이중 신분 세금 신고서)를 상단에 가로질러 입력하십시오. 해당 연도에 비거주 외국인이였던 기간 동안의 미국 출처 소득을 보여주는 내역서를 첨부하십시오. 양식 1040-NR을 이 내역서로 사용할 수있습니다. 상단에 “Dual-Status Return” (이중 신분 세금 신고서)라고 기입하십시오. 귀하의 거주지를 결정하기 위한 규칙에 대해서는 1장에서 [_거주 첫 해_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222164 "거주 첫 해")를 참고하십시오. 귀하가 직원이고 미국 소득세 원천징수가 적용되는 급여를 받는다면, 귀하는 반드시 일반적으로 과세연도 종료 이후 4번째 개월의 15일까지 제출해야 합니다. 2024 역년에 대한 신고서를 제출한다면 신고서 제출 마감일은 2025년 4월 15일 입니다. 귀하가 미국 소득세 원천징수가 적용되는 급여를 받는 직원이 아니라면, 일반적으로 과세연도 종료 이후 6번째 달의 15일까지 반드시 제출해야 합니다. 2024역년에 대한 신고서를 제출한다면 2025년 6월 16일까지 세금 신고서를 제출하십시오. 신고 시기와 제출처에 대한 자세한 내용은 [7장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222581 "신고 정보")에서 [신고 시기](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222595 "신고 시기") 및 [제출처](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222600 "제출 주소")를 참고하십시오. 사회보장 번호는 세금 신고서, 진술서 그리고 기타 세금 관련 서류에 반드시 제공되야 합니다. 귀하의 배우자가 SSN을 갖고 있지 않거나 SSN을 받을 자격이 없다면, 개인 납세자 식별 번호 (ITIN)를 반드시 신청해야 합니다. 귀하가 미국 시민이거나 거주자이며 공동 세금 신고서 제출을 위해 본인의 비거주 배우자를 거주자로 간주하기로 선택했다면 이 배우자는 SSN 또는 ITIN이 필요합니다. 부양가족으로 청구된 외국인 배우자 또한 SSN 또는 ITIN을 제공하도록 요구됩니다. 자세한 정보는 5장에서 [_식별 번호_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222405 "식별 번호")를 참고하십시오. 과세연도 도중 배우자 중 한명이라도 비거주 외국인이였다면 일반적으로 귀하는 부부 공동 신고를 할 수 없습니다. 하지만 미국 시민 또는 거주자와 결혼한 비거주 외국인은 미국 거주자로 간주되기로 선택을 할 수 있으며 공동 신고서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 이 선택에 대한 자세한 정보는 1장에서 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")를 참고하십시오. 두명 모두가 전년도 전체 동안 이 비자를 갖고 있다고 가정할때, 귀하가 거주 외국인일 경우, 귀하의 배우자가 학생 신분으로 5년 이상 미국에 살지 않았다면 배우자는 비거주 외국인입니다. 만약 배우자가 전체 연도에 대해 거주자로 간주되기로 선택했다면 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 공동 신고서로 제출할 수 있습니다. 1장에서 [_거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222193 "거주자로 간주하는 비거주 배우자")를 참고하십시오. 만약 귀하의 배우자가 이 선택을 하지 않았다면, 귀하는 반드시 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR를 개별로 제출해야 합니다. 배우자는 반드시 양식 1040-NR을 제출해야 합니다. 아니오. 이중 거주 납세자는 각각의 국가의 세금법 하에, 미국 그리고 또 다른 국가 거주자인 사람입니다. 1장에서 [_조세협정 효력_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222158 "조세협정의 효력")을 참고하십시오. 귀하가 동일 연도에 거주 외국인이며 비거주 외국인이였다면 [이중 신분 외국인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222162 "이중 신분 외국인")입니다. 이중 신분 과세연도에 대한 미국 소득세를 판단하기 위한 정보는 [6장](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222522 "이중 신분 과세연도")을 참고하십시오. 배당금과 자본 이득이 미국 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결되지 않았다면 다음 규칙을 적용하십시오.

  * 배당금은 일반적으로 30% (또는 더 낮은 협정) 세율로 과세됩니다. 배당금의 중개 회사 또는 지급인은 이 세금을 출처에서 원천징수 해야 합니다. 올바른 세율로 세금이 원천징수되지 않았다면, 귀하는 환급을 받거나 추가로 내야할 세금을 납부하기 위해 양식 1040-NR을 반드시 제출해야 합니다.

만약 자본 이득과 배당금이 미국의 거래 또는 사업과 실질적으로 연결되었다면, 이에 대하여 미국 시민과 거주자에게 적용되는 같은 규칙과 같은 세율에 따라 과세됩니다. 귀하가 비거주 외국인이라면 세금이 면제되거나 더 낮은 협정 세율에 적용되지 않는다면 미국 사회보장 혜택의 85% (그리고 1급 철도 퇴직 혜택과 동등 부분)는 고정 30%의 세금이 부과됩니다. 4장에서 [_30% 세금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222345 "30% 세금")을 참고하십시오. 비거주 외국인이며 미국 출처가 아닌 장학금을 받았다면, 미국 세금이 적용되지 않습니다. 2장에서 [_장학금, 지원금, 상금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222235 "장학금, 지원금, 상금 및 공로상금")을 참고하여 장학금이 미국 출처 여부를 판단하십시오. 만약 장학금이 미국 출처이거나 귀하가 거주 외국인이면, 귀하의 장학금은 다음의 규칙에 따라 미국 세금에 적용됩니다.
  * 만약 귀하가 학위 예정자라면, 귀하가 학비, 요금, 책, 용품, 장비에 사용한 장학금의 일부를 소득으로부터 제외할 수 있습니다. 방이나 기숙사 등 다른 비용을 납부하기 위해 사용한 장학금의 일부는 과세 대상입니다. 자세한 정보는 3장의 [_장학금 및 연구 지원금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519ko#en_US_2024_publink1000222293 "장학금 및 연구 지원금")을 참고하십시오.
