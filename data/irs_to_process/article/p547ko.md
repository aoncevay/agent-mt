# 간행물 547 - 주요 내용
#### 재해
재해는 갑작스럽거나, 예기치 못하거나, 드물게 일어나는 식별 가능한 사건으로 인한 자산의 손상, 파괴, 또는 손실입니다.
  * 갑작스러운 사건은 점진적이거나 진행형이 아닌 신속하게 벌어진 사건입니다.
  * 예기치 못한 사건은 일반적으로 예상치 못했고 의도하지 않은 사건입니다.
  * 비정상적인 사건은 일상적으로 일어나지 않는 사건으로, 관여하고 있는 활동에서 일반적인 일이 아닌 사건입니다.


손실을 입은 과세연도에 재해 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이는 일반적으로 손실이 발생한 과세연도입니다. 그러나 재해가 발생한 다음연도에 재해 손실을 입을 수 도 있습니다. 추후에 [_손익 신고 시기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225399 "손익 신고 시기") 및 [표 3](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225388)을 참고하십시오.
**용어 정의.**
이 간행물에는 세 가지 구체적인 유형의 재해 손실이 설명되어 있습니다.
  1. [연방 재해 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100014701 "연방 재해 손실.").
  2. [재난 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100014702 "재난 손실.").
  3. [적격 재난 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100014703 "적격 재난 손실.").


세 가지 유형의 손실은 모두 연방 선포 재난을 참조하지만, 각 손실에 대한 요건은 다릅니다. 연방 선포 재난은 미국 대통령이 스태포드법에 따라 연방 정부의 지원을 보장하기 위해 결정한 재난입니다. 연방에서 선포한 재난에는 (a) 중대 재난 선포, 또는 (b) 스태포드법에 따른 긴급 선포가 포함됩니다.
_**연방 재해 손실.**_
연방 재해 손실은 연방 정부에서 선포한 재난에서 비롯된 개인 재해 또는 개인 용도 자산의 도난 손실입니다. 재해 손실은 반드시 연방 재난 선포를 받은 주에서 발생해야 합니다. 연방 재해 손실을 입은 경우 재해 손실 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 것이 아닌 개인 용도 자산의 상해 및 도난 손실을 입은 경우, 이는 연방 재해 손실이 아니며, 예외가 적용되지 않는 한 재해 손실 공제를 청구할 수 없습니다. 이익 목적으로 체결한 거래에서 발생한 도난 손일은 여전히 공제대상이 될 수 있습니다. 추후에 _공제 가능 손실_ 에서 [_주의사항_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink10008071)을 참고하십시오.
_**재난 손실.**_
재난 손실은 연방 선포 재난에서 비롯된 손실이며, 대통령 선포에 따른 지원 대상 지역에서 발생한 손실입니다. 재난 손실은 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)이 가능한 카운티에서 발생해야 합니다. 재난 손실은 개인 용도 자산에만 국한되지 않으며, 개인 사업 또는 소득창출 자산에 대해, 그리고 법인, S 법인 및 파트너쉽도 청구할 수 있습니다. 재난 손실을 입은 경우, 재해 손실 공제를 청구할 수 있으며 직전 과세연도의 손실을 청구할 때 사용할 수 있습니다. 추후에 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")에서 참고하십시오.
_**적격 재난 손실.**_
적격 재난 손실에는 다음 사유로 인한 개인의 상해 및 개인 용도 자산의 도난 손실이 포함됩니다.
  * 2016년 스태포드 법 섹션 401에 따라 대통령이 선포한 대형 재난,
  * 허리케인 하비,
  * 열대 폭풍 하비, 
  * 허리케인 어마, 
  * 허리케인 마리아, 
  * 2017년과 2018년 1월 캘리포니아 산불.
  * 스태포드 법 섹션 401에 따라 대통령이 선포한 대형 재난으로, 2018년 및 2019년 12월 21일 이전에 발생했으며 2020년 1월 19일 이후로 지속되지 않음 (사전 완화 조치를 받은 2018년 1월 캘리포니아 산불로 인한 재해 제외), 그리고
  * 2020년 1월 1일부터 2025년 2월 10일의 기간 사이에 대통령이 선포한 대형 재해. 또한 이 재난 발생 기간이 2019년 12월 28일 당일 또는 이후부터 2024년 12월 12일 당일 또는 이전이어야 하며, 반드시 2025년 1월 11일 이전에 종료됐어야 합니다.


### 비고.
적격 재난 손실의 정의는 COVID-19 사유로만 선포된 대형 재난에는 적용되지 않습니다.
적격 재난 손실의 피해를 입은 경우, 재해 손실 공제 청구, 이전 과세연도의 손실 청구 선택 및 스케줄 A (양식 1040)에서 기타 공제들을 항목별로 기재하지 않고 손실을 공제할 자격이 있습니다.
[IRS.gov/DisasterTaxRelief](https://www.irs.gov/ko/newsroom/tax-relief-in-disaster-situations)에서 이러한 재난과 관련된 날짜별 선포 및 자세한 내용을 확인하십시오.
**공제 가능 손실.**
개인인 경우, 2018년부터 2025년까지 과세연도에 대해 개인 용도 자산의 재해 손실은 연방 선포 재난 (연방 재해 손실)에서 비롯된 손실의 범위 내에서만 공제 가능합니다. 개인 용도 자산이란 사업 자산 또는 소득 창출 자산이 아닌 자산입니다. 개인 재해 손실 (연방 선포 재난로 인한 것이 아닌)이 발생하는 사건이 2018년 1월 1일 이전에 발생했지만, 2018년 1월 1일 또는 그 이후까지 손해를 입지 않았을 경우, 개인 재해 손실은 공제할 수 없습니다. 추후에 [_손익 신고 시기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225399 "손익 신고 시기")를 참고하여, 재해 손실을 입은 시기에 대한 자세한 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.
**예시.**
폭풍으로 인해, 2022년 12월 귀하의 집에 나무가 쓰러졌고, 귀하는 $5,000의 피해를 입었습니다. 대통령은 이 폭풍을 연방 선포 재난으로 선포하지 않았습니다. 귀하는 보험사에 보험금을 청구했으며, 청구한 전체 금액이 보험사로부터 지급될 것이라고 합리적으로 예상했습니다. 2024년 1월, 귀하의 보험 회사는 $3,000을 지급했으며 청구한 금액에서 나머지 $2,000을 지급하지 않는다고 판단했습니다. 2022년에 태풍이 발생했음에도 불구하고 2024년에 $2,000의 재해 손실을 입었습니다. $2,000는 연방 재해 손실이 아니므로 새로운 제한에 따라 재해 손실로 공제할 수 없습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_개인 재해 이득이 있는 경우, 개인 재해 및 도난 손실에 대한 공제를 연방 재해 손실로 제한하는 규칙의 예외가 적용됩니다. 이 경우, 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서 연방에서 선언한 재난에서 비롯되지 않은 개인 재해 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다._.
재해 손실은 다음과 같은 여러 가지 원인으로 인해 발생할 수 있습니다. 
  * 자동차 사고 (하지만 다음 [_공제 불가 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225204 "공제 불가 손실.")에서 예외 참고). 
  * 지진.
  * 화재 (하지만 다음 [_공제 불가 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225204 "공제 불가 손실.")에서 예외 참고). 
  * 홍수.
  * 재난으로 인해 사용하기 안전하지 않은 주택의 정부 명령 철거 또는 이전 (추후 _[재난 지역 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")_ 에서 참고하십시오). 
  * 갱도 붕괴. 
  * 난파선. 
  * 음속 폭음. 
  * 태풍 (허리케인 및 토네이도 포함). 
  * 테러 공격.
  * 기물파손. 
  * 화산 폭발.


**공제 불가 손실.**
다음과 같은 이유로 인해 손상 또는 파괴가 발생한 경우, 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서도 재해 손실이 공제되지 않습니다. 
  * 정상적인 조건에서 유리 제품 또는 도자 제품과 같은 물품이 실수로 파손. 
  * 반려동물 (아래 설명 참고). 
  * 고의적 방화 또는 다른 사람에게 교사해서 발생한 화재. 
  * 귀하의 고의적인 과실 또는 고의적인 행위로 인해 발생한 자동차 사고. 귀하를 대신해 행동하는 사람의 고의적인 행위 또는 과실이 사고를 일으킨 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 
  * 점진적 악화 (아래 설명 참고). 그러나 추후에 [_부식성 건식 벽체 손상에 대한 특별 절차_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000251014 "부식성 건식 벽체 손상에 대한 특별 절차")를 참고하십시오.


_**반려동물.**_
반려동물이 입힌 손상으로 인한 자산 손실은 앞서 [_재해_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225200 "재해")에서 논의한 요건이 충족되지 않는 한 재해 손실로 공제할 수 없습니다.
**예시.**
골동품 중동 양탄자는 귀하의 아직 길들여지지 않은 강아지에 의해 손상되었습니다. 이 손상이 예상치 못했던 것이 아니였고 비정상적이 아니였기 때문에, 이 손실은 재해 손실로 공제할 수 없습니다. 
_**점진적 악화.**_
점진적 악화로 인한 자산 손실은 재해 손실로 공제할 수 없습니다. 이는 피해가 갑작스러운 사건이 아닌 꾸준히 작동하는 원인 또는 정상적인 과정에 대한 결과이기 때문입니다. 다음은 점진적 악화에 따른 손상에 대한 예시입니다. 
  * 정상적인 바람과 기상 조건으로 인한 건물의 지속적인 약화.
  * 폭발하는 온수기의 열화와 손상. 그러나, 온수기의 터짐으로 인한 러그와 커튼의 녹과 물 손상은 재해 피해로 인정됩니다. 
  * 대부분의 자산 손실이 가뭄에 의한 경우. 공제가 가능하려면 일반적으로 가뭄 관련 손실이 거래 또는 사업 또는 이익을 위해 체결된 거래에서 발생했어야 합니다. 
  * 흰개미 또는 나방 피해. 
  * 곰팡이, 질병, 곤충, 벌레 또는 유사한 해충에 의한 나무, 관목 또는 기타 식물의 손상 또는 파괴. 그러나, 예상치 못한 또는 특이한 딱정벌레 또는 다른 곤충의 감염으로 인한 갑작스러운 파괴는 재해 손실을 초래할 수 있습니다. 


#### 부식성 건식 벽체 손상에 대한 특별 절차
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_이 특별 절차에 따라 청구된 개인 재해 손실은 연방에서 선언한 재난에서 비롯되지 않았기 때문에, 해당 손실이 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서만 공제받을 수 있습니다._.
특별 절차에 따라 2001년에서 2009년 사이에 집에 설치된 특정 수입 건식 벽체의 영향으로 자산 손실을 입은 경우, 부식성 건식 벽체로 인한 집과 가전제품의 손상을 복구하기 위해 지불한 금액을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이 절차에 따라, 수리를 위해 지불한 금액을 지급 연도의 재해 손실로 처리합니다. 예를 들어, 2024년 수리비로 지불한 금액은 2024년 세금 신고서에서 공제 가능하며, 2023년에 수리비로 지불한 금액은 2023년 세금 신고서에서 공제 가능합니다.
### 참고.
2024년 이전에 수리 비용을 지불했고 이 특별 절차를 따르기로 선택한 경우, 이전 연도의 신고서를 수정하기 위해 양식 1040-X, ‘수정된 미국 개인 소득세 신고서’를 제출하고, 해당 연도에 작성된 양식 4684를 첨부하십시오. 해당 연도의 양식 4684는 IRS.gov에서 찾을 수 있습니다. 일반적으로, 1040-X 양식은 최초 신고일로부터 3년 이내 또는 세금이 납부된 날로부터 2년 이내 중 더 늦은 날까지 제출해야 합니다.
**부식성 건식 벽체.**
이 특별 절차의 목적상, “부식성 건식 벽체”는 소비자 제품 안전 위원회 (CPSC) 및 주택 도시 개발부 (HUD)가 개정한 2010년 1월 28일 자 임시 지침에 CPSC 및 HUD가 게시한 2단계 식별 방법에 따라 문제성 건식 벽체로 식별된 건식 벽체를 의미합니다. 개정된 식별 지침 및 개선 지침은 [CPSC.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Drywall-Information-Center(영어)](https://cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Drywall-Information-Center)에 나와있습니다.

#### 도난
도난이란 소유자의 자산을 박탈할 의도로 금전이나 재산을 빼앗고 제거하는 것입니다. 재산을 빼앗는 행위는 발생한 주의 법률에 따라 불법이어야 하며, 범죄 목적으로 행해졌어야 합니다. 도난에 대한 유죄 판결을 보여줄 필요가 없습니다.
도난에는 다음과 같은 방법으로 금전이나 자산을 빼앗는 것이 포함됩니다.
  * 협박.
  * 빈집털이.
  * 횡령.
  * 강요.
  * 몸값을 노린 납치.
  * 절도.
  * 강도.


사기나 허위 진술을 통해 금전이나 자산을 빼앗는 것이 주 또는 지역 법률에 따라 불법인 경우 도난입니다. 
**도난 손실 공제 제한.**
개인인 경우, 2018년부터 2025년까지 과세연도에 대해, 개인 용도 자산의 재해 및 도난 손실은 연방 선포 재난 (연방 재해 손실)에서 비롯된 손실의 범위 내에서만 공제 가능합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_개인 재해 이득이 있는 경우에는 개인 재해 및 도난 손실에 대한 공제를 연방 재해 손실로 제한하는 규칙의 예외가 적용됩니다. 이 경우, 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서 연방 선언 재해에서 비록되지 않은 개인 재해 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다._.
**예시.**
마틴과 그레이스는 2024년에 다수의 개인 재해를 경험했습니다. 그레이스의 다이아몬드 목걸이를 도난당해 $15,500의 재해 손실이 발생했습니다. 마틴과 그레이스는 낙뢰로 캠핑카도 손실했습니다. 캠핑카에 신가보험을 가지고 있었기 때문에, $13,000의 이득을 보았습니다. 마지막으로, 그들은 연방 정부가 공식 재난으로 선포한 홍수로 인해 차를 잃었고, 그 결과로 재해 손실이 $25,000이 되었습니다. 마틴과 그레이스는 신가보험의 결과로 $13,000의 개인 재해 이득을 보았기 때문에, 그 이득을 도난된 목걸이로 인한 손실의 일부로 상쇄하고 총 연방 재해 손실로 $25,000을 $100 및 10% AGI 삭감을 적용한 후 청구할 수 있습니다.
**주식의 시장가치 하락.**
투자를 위해 주식시장에서 취득한 주식을 발행한 법인의 임원 또는 이사의 분식회계 또는 기타 불법행위로 인해 시장가치가 하락한 경우, 시가총액 하락을 도난 손실로 공제할 수 없습니다. 그러나 주식이 판매 또는 교환되거나 완전히 무가치하게 되는 경우 스케줄 D (양식 1040)에서 자본 손실로 공제할 수 있습니다. 주식 매도, 무가치 주식 및 자본 손실에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 550의 4장을 참고하십시오. 
**잘못 둔 또는 분실 자산.**
돈이나 자산이 단순하게 사라진 것은 도난이 아닙니다. 그러나 갑작스럽거나, 예기치 못하거나, 드물게 일어나는 식별 가능한 사건으로 인한 우발적인 자산의 손실이나 소실은 재해로 인정될 수 있습니다. 갑작스럽고, 예기치 못하며, 특이한 사건은 이전의 [_재해_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225200 "재해")에 정의되어 있습니다.
**예시.**
자동차 문이 실수로 손에 부딪혀 다이아몬드 링의 세팅이 깨집니다. 다이아몬드는 반지에서 떨어졌으며 발견되지 않습니다. 다이아몬드의 손실은 재해입니다. 
**폰지형 투자방식으로 인한 손실.**
IRS는 폰지형 투자방식으로 인한 손실의 피해자인 납세자를 돕기 위해 다음과 같은 지침을 발표했습니다.
  * 국세 통칙 2009-9, 2009-14 I.R.B. 735 ([IRS.gov/irb/2009-14_IRB#RR-2009-9(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/irb/2009-14_IRB#RR-2009-9)에서 제공).
  * 국세 절차 2009-20, 2009-14 I.R.B. 749 ([IRS.gov/irb/2009-14_IRB#RP-2009-20(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/irb/2009-14_IRB#RP-2009-20)에서 제공).
  * 국세 절차 2011-58, 2011-50 I.R.B. 849 [IRS.gov/irb/2011-50_IRB#RP-2011-58(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/irb/2011-50_IRB#RP-2011-58)에서 제공).


만약 국세 절차 2009-20 (국세 절차 2011-58에 의해 수정됨) 사용 자격이 있고 절차를 따르기로 선택한 경우, 먼저 양식 4684의 섹션 C을 작성하여 섹션 B, 라인 28에 입력할 금액을 결정하십시오 . 라인 19~27을 건너뛰되, 해당되는 경우 섹션 B, 라인 29~39를 작성해야 합니다. 양식 4684의 섹션 C는 국세 절차 2009-20에서 부록 A를 대체합니다. 부록 A를 작성할 필요가 없습니다. 자세한 내용은 위의 국세 통칙 및 국세 절차, 양식 4684에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
만약 국세 절차 2009-20 (국세 절차 2011-58에 의해 수정됨)을 따르지 않기로 선택한 경우, 도난 손실은 섹션 B, 라인 19~39를 적절하게 작성하여 청구할 수 있습니다.
2018년부터 2025년까지 과세연도에 대한 개인 용도 자산 제한은 폰지형 투자 계획 손실과 같은 소득창출 자산 손실에는 적용되지 않습니다.
#### 예금 손실
예금 손실은 은행, 신용 조합, 금융 기관이 부도가 나거나 파산할 때 발생합니다. 이러한 유형의 손실이 발생한 경우 다음 방법 중 하나를 선택하여 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다.
  * 개인 재해 손실 (개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서).
  * 비사업 대손상각.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_부도 또는 파산 금융 기관의 예금에 대한 경상 손실 공제를 포함하여 기타 항목별 공제를 더 이상 청구할 수 없습니다._.
**재해 손실.**
부도 또는 파산한 금융 기관에서 예금 손실액을 합리적으로 추정할 수 있는 모든 연도의 예금 손실을 재해 손실로 공제하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 귀하가 신고서 제출한 해당 연도에 이러한 선택을 할 수 있으며, 해당 금융 기관의 해당 연도에 대한 귀하의 모든 예금 손실에 적용됩니다. 만약 손실을 재해 손실로 취급한다면, 실제로 모든 가치를 상실하게 되었을 때 이와 똑같은 손실액을 비사업 대손상각으로 취급할 수 없습니다. 단, 손실액이 재해 또는 경상 손실로 공제된 예상 금액을 초과하는 경우 비사업 대손상각 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 선택한 후에는 IRS의 허가 없이는 변경할 수 없습니다. 
_**재해 손실 한도.**_
귀하가 개인인 경우, 개인 용도 자산의 재해 손실은 연방 선포 재해에서 비롯된 손실인 경우에만 공제 가능합니다. 개인 재해 및 도난 손실에 대한 공제를 연방 재해 손실로 제한하는 규칙의 예외는 개인 재해 이득의 경우에 적용됩니다. 예금 손실은 연방에서 선언한 재해에 기인하지 않기 때문에, 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서만 개인 재해 손실로 예치금 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다.
**비사업 대손상각.**
손익의 상쇄를 목적으로 손실을 재해 손실로 청구하지 않는 경우, 실제 손실이 결정되는 해까지 기다려야 하며 그해에 손실을 비사업 대손상각으로 공제해야 합니다.
**신고 방법.**
예금 손실에 대해 선택한 공제의 종류는 손실을 신고하는 방법을 결정합니다. [표 1](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000143513 "표 1. 예치금 손실 신고        ")을 참고하십시오.
#### 표 1.**예치금 손실 신고**
**손실을 아래와 같이 신고하기로 선택한 경우** |  | **아래에 신고하십시오.**  
---|---|---  
재해 손실 ([_재해 손실 한도_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink10008100 "재해 손실 한도.")를 _예금 손실_ 에서 참고) |  | 양식 4684와 스케줄 A (양식 1040).  
비사업 대손상각 |  | 양식 8949와 스케줄 D (양식 1040).  
**추가 정보.**
자세한 내용은, 간행물 550에서 _파산 금융기관 예치금_ 을 참고하십시오.
**공제한 손실의 회수.**
이전 해에 손실로 공제된 금액을 회수한 경우, 회수 연도의 소득에 회수된 금액을 포함해야 할 수 있습니다. 기존 공제액이 이전 연도에 세금을 줄이는 데 전혀 사용되지 않았다면, 복구된 금액을 소득에 포함시킬 필요가 없습니다. 자세한 내용은, 간행물 525에서 _회수_ 를 참고하십시오. 
#### 손실 증명
재해 또는 도난 손실을 공제하려면, 재해 또는 도난이 발생했었음을 반드시 증명할 수 있어야 합니다. 또한 공제 받은 금액을 증명할 수 있어야 합니다.
**재해 손실 증명.**
재해 손실에 대해, 다음 모든 사항을 보여줄 수 있어야 합니다. 
  * 귀하가 자산의 소유자이거나 또는 다른 사람으로부터 자산을 임대한 경우, 그 손해에 대해 소유자에게 계약상의 책임이 있다는 것. 
  * 재해의 유형 (자동차 사고, 화재, 폭풍 등) 및 발생 시기. 
  * 재해 발생의 직접적인 결과로 손실이 발생했었음.
  * 복구에 대한 합리적인 기대가 있는 경우, 상환 청구가 존재하는지 여부. 


**도난 손실 증명.**
도난 발생 시, 다음 모든 사항을 보여줄 수 있어야 합니다. 
  * 본인이 자산의 소유자임.
  * 본인의 자산이 도난당했음.
  * 자산이 누락된 것을 발견한 시기.
  * 복구가 합리적으로 예상되는 경우, 상환 청구의 존재 여부. 


.![This is an Image: files.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/files.gif)_공제를 증명할 수 있는 기록이 있는 것이 중요합니다. 공제를 증빙할 실제 기록이 없는 경우, 이를 뒷받침할 다른 충분한 증거를 사용할 수 있습니다._.
#### 손실 파악
재해 또는 도난 손실에 대한 공제를 결정하려면, 먼저 손실을 파악해야 합니다.
**손실액.**
다음 단계를 사용하여 손실 금액을 계산하십시오. 
  1. 재해나 도난 사고가 발생하기 전에 자산에 대한 조정된 기초가액을 결정합니다.
  2. 재해 또는 도난의 결과로 감소된 자산의 공정 시장 가치 (FMV)를 결정합니다.
  3. 수령했거나 수령할 것으로 예상하는 보험 또는 기타 상환금을 (1)과 (2)에서 결정한 금액 중 적은 금액에서 차감합니다.


개인 용도 자산의 경우, 나중에 논의되는 [공제 한도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225293 "공제 한도")를 적용하여 공제 가능한 손실 금액을 결정하십시오.
_**상환로 인한 이득.**_
상환액이 조정된 자산 원가보다 많으면 이득이 생깁니다. 자산의 FMV 감소가 조정된 원가보다 작더라도 마찬가지입니다. 이익이 있는 경우, 이에 대한 세금을 내야 할 수도 있고, 이익 신고를 연기할 수도 있습니다. 추후에 [_이득 파악_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225344 "이득 파악")을 참고하십시오. 
_**사업 또는 소득창출 자산.**_
임대 자산과 같은 사업용 또는 소득창출 자산을 보유하고 있으며, 자산이 도난당하거나 완전히 파괴된 경우 FMV의 감소는 고려되지 않습니다. 손실은 다음과 같이 측정됩니다. 
| 자산의 조정된 기초가액 |   
---|---|---  
| 빼기 |   
| 모든 잔존 가치 |   
| 빼기 |   
| 총 보험금 또는 기타 상환액 (받거나 받을 것으로 예상되는 금액) |   
_**재고자산 손실.**_
고객에게 판매하기 위해 보유한 품목을 포함하여, 재고자산의 재해 또는 도난 손실을 공제할 수 있는 두 가지 방법이 있습니다. 
한 가지 방법은 기초재고액과 기말재고를 적절히 신고하여 재고원가 비용의 증가를 통해 손실을 공제하는 것입니다. 이 손실을 재해 또는 도난 손실로 다시 청구하지 마십시오. 재고원가 비용의 증가를 통해 손실을 공제하는 경우, 모든 보험 또는 기타 상환액을 총소득에 포함하십시오. 
다른 방법은 손실을 개별적으로 공제하는 것입니다. 개별적으로 공제하는 경우, 기초재고액 또는 매입액을 하향 조정하여 재고원가 비용에서 영향을 받는 재고자산 항목을 제거하십시오. 받은 상환금만큼 손실액을 줄이십시오. 총소득에 상환액을 포함하지 마십시오. 연말까지 상환금을 수령하지 못할 경우, 합리적인 복구 전망이 있는 범위 내에서는 손실을 청구할 수 없습니다.
_**임차 자산.**_
임대한 자산의 재해 피해에 대한 책임이 있는 경우, 손실액은 자산을 수리하기 위해 지불해야 하는 금액에서 수령하거나 수령할 것으로 예상되는 모든 보험 또는 기타 상환액을 뺀 금액입니다. 
**개별 계산.**
일반적으로, 한 건의 재해 또는 도난에 두 항목 이상의 자산이 포함된 경우, 각 항목의 손실을 반드시 별도로 파악해야 합니다. 그런 다음 손실을 합산하여 해당 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 총 손실을 결정하십시오. 
_**개인 용도 자산에 대한 예외.**_
개인 용도의 부동산에 대한 재해 손실을 파악할 때, (건물, 나무, 관목과 같은 모든 개선 사항을 포함한) 전체 부동산은 하나의 항목으로 취급됩니다. 다음 중 더 작은 값을 사용하여 손실을 계산하십시오. 
  * 전체 자산의 FMV 감소.
  * 자산 전체의 조정된 기초원가.


추후에 [_부동산_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225328 "부동산.")을 _공제 파악_ 에서 참고하십시오. 
#### FMV의 감소
FMV는 구매자와 판매자에게 판매하거나 구매해야 할 필요가 없고 둘 다 관련 사실을 모두 알고 있을 때 기꺼이 구매자에게 자산을 판매할 수 있는 가격입니다.
재해 또는 도난 손실의 금액을 파악하는 데 사용되는 FMV의 감소는 재해 또는 도난 직전과 직후 자산의 FMV 차이입니다.
**도난당한 자산의 FMV.**
도난 직후 자산의 FMV는 더 이상 보유한 자산이 아니기 때문에 0으로 간주됩니다. 
**예시.**
몇 년 전, 귀하는 액면가 $150에 은화를 구입했습니다. 자산의 조정된 기초원가는 이 금액입니다. 올해 은화를 절도 당했습니다. 동전의 FMV는 도난당하기 직전에 $1,000였으며 보험은 이를 보상해주지 않았습니다. 도난 손실은 $150입니다.
**도난당한 자산의 복구.**
도난당한 자산의 복구는 도난당했다가 나중에 복구한 자산입니다. 이미 도난 손실 공제를 한 후 자산을 복구한 경우, [조정된 기초가액](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225261 "조정된 기초가액") (나중에 설명) 또는 도난 직전부터 복구된 시점까지의 FMV 감소 중 더 적은 금액을 사용하여 손실을 다시 파악해야 합니다. 이 금액을 사용하여 손실이 공제된 연도의 총 손실을 다시 파악하십시오. 
재파악된 손실이 공제된 손실보다 작은 경우, 일반적으로 그 차액을 복구 연도의 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 하지만 세금 감면 효과가 있는 손실액까지만 신고하십시오. 신고할 금액에 대한 자세한 내용은, 간행물 525에서 ’ _복구_ ’를 참고하십시오. 
#### FMV 감소 파악 - 고려할 항목
재해 또는 도난으로 인한 FMV의 감소를 파악하려면 일반적으로 유능한 감정이 필요합니다. 그러나 특정 감소를 확립하기 위해 다른 조치를 사용할 수도 있습니다. 아래의 [_감정_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225244 "감정."), [_청소 또는 수리 비용_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225247 "청소 또는 수리 비용.") 및 [_특별 절차-재해 및 도난 손실 판정을 위한 피난처 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100079115 "특별 절차-재해 및 도난 손실 판정을 위한 피난처 방법")을 참고하십시오.
**감정.**
재해 또는 도난 직전과 직후 부동산의 FMV의 차이를 파악하기 위한 감정은 유능한 감정사가 수행해야 합니다. 감정사는 재해와 함께 발생할 수 있는 일반적인 시장 하락의 영향을 반드시 인식해야 합니다. 이 정보는 자산 손상으로 인한 실제 손실로 공제를 제한하는 데 필요합니다. 
감정의 정확성을 평가하는 데 중요한 몇 가지 요소는 다음과 같습니다. 
  * 귀하 자산의 재해 또는 도난 발생 전후에 대한 감정사의 숙지.
  * 이 지역의 비슷한 자산 매매에 대한 감정사의 지식.
  * 재해 발생 지역의 상태에 대한 감정사의 지식.
  * 감정인의 감정방법. 


.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_연방에서 선포한 재난의 결과로 연방 대출 (또는 연방 대출 보증)을 받기 위해 사용한 감정서를 사용하여 재난 손실 금액을 확립할 수 있습니다. 재난에 대한 자세한 내용은 추후에_[재난 지역 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실") _을 참고하십시오._.
**청소 또는 수리 비용.**
파손된 자산을 수리하는 데 드는 비용은 재해 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 재해 후 청소 비용도 포함되지 않습니다. 그러나 다음 조건을 모두 충족하는 경우 FMV 감소의 척도로 재해 후 청소 또는 수리 비용을 사용할 수 있습니다. 
  * 수리가 실제로 이루짐.
  * 자산을 재해가 발생하기 전의 원래 상태로 되돌리기 위해 수리가 필요함.
  * 수리를 위해 지출한 금액이 과하지 않음.
  * 수리는 손상만 해결함.
  * 수리로 인해, 수리 후의 자산의 가치가 재해 발생 전의 자산의 가치보다 더 높지 않음.


_**조경.**_
재해 후 원래 상태로 조경을 복원하는 비용은 FMV의 감소를 나타낼 수 있습니다. 다음에 대한 지출에 따라 손실을 측정할 수 있습니다. 
  * 훼손되거나 손상된 나무 및 관목의 제거 빼기 모든 잔존 가치.
  * 훼손된 나무와 관목을 보존하기 위한 가지치기 및 기타 조치.
  * 재해가 발생하기 전에의 대략적인 자산 가치를 복원하는 데 필요한 재묘목. 


**자동차 가치.**
다양한 자동차 조직들에서 발행하는 자동차 제조업체 및 모델을 나열하고 있는 책자들은 자동차의 가치를 파악하는 데 유용할 수 있습니다. 책자에 기재된 차량의 소매 가치를 사용하고 주행 거리 및 차량 상태와 같은 요인에 따라 수정하여 차량의 가치를 결정할 수 있습니다. 공식적인 가격은 아니지만, 가격을 결정하고 해당 지역의 현재 판매 및 매물과 비교하기 위한 상대적인 가격을 제안하는 데 유용할 수 있습니다. 차량이 책자에 등록되지 않은 경우 다른 출처에서 차량의 가치를 확인하십시오. 새 차에 대한 거래로서 딜러의 트레이드 인에 대한 귀하의 차량의 제시금액은 일반적으로 진정한 가치를 나타내는 것이 아닙니다.
#### 특별 절차-재해 및 도난 손실 판정을 위한 피난처 방법
재해 및 도난 손실 금액을 파악하려면 일반적으로 유능한 감정을 사용하여 손실 또는 손상된 자산의 FMV의 실제 감소 또는 실제 수리 비용을 결정해야 합니다. 하지만 국세 절차 2018-08, 2018-2 I.R.B. 286에 있는 특별 피난처 방법을 통해 다른 방법으로 FMV의 감소를 결정할 수 있습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_개인의 경우, 개인 용도 자산의 재해 손실은 연방 선포 재해에서 비롯된 손실인 경우에만 공제 가능합니다. 개인 재해 및 도난 손실에 대한 공제를 제한하는 규칙에 대한 예외는 개인 재해 이득이 발생했을 경우에 적용됩니다. 이러한 경우, 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서 귀하는 연방에서 선언한 재해에 기인하지 않은 개인 재해 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다._.
**일반적으로 재해 및 도난 손실을 결정하기 위한 특수 절차.**
국세 절차 2018-08, 2018-2 I.R.B. 286 ([IRS.gov/irb/2018-02_IRB#RP-2018-08(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/ko/irb/2018-02_IRB#RP-2018-08)에서 제공)은 개인 용도 주거 부동산 및 개인 소지품의 재해 및 도난 손실 금액을 파악하는 데 사용할 수 있는 피난처 방법을 제공합니다. 국세 절차 2018-08에 설명된 피난처 방법을 사용하고 자격을 충족하는 경우, IRS는 귀하의 결정에 이의를 제기하지 않을 것입니다. 국세 절차 2018-08에 설명된 피난처 방법의 사용은 의무 사항이 아닙니다.
**개인 용도 주거 부동산 피난처 방법.**
개인 용도 주거 부동산은 일반적으로 재해 손실을 입은 개인이 소유하고 있으며 적어도 하나의 개인 주거지가 포함되어 있는 개선 사항이 포함된 부동산입니다. 개인 주거지의 일부가 임대 자산으로 사용되거나 거래 또는 사업 또는 이익을 위한 거래에 사용된 주택 사무소가 포함된 경우 개인 주거지는 포함되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 국세 절차 2018-08을 참고하시기 바랍니다.
국세 절차 2018-08에서 사용할 수 있는 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 피난처 방법은 다음과 같습니다.
  * 예상 수리비 방법.
  * 최소허용기준 방법.
  * 보험 방법.
  * 연방 선포 재난 방법—도급업자 피난처.
  * 연방 선포 재난 방법-재난 대출 감정.


_**예상 수리비 방법.**_
예상 수리 비용 피난처 방법을 사용하면 개별적 그리고 독립된 면허소지 두 도급업자가 준비한 두 가지 수리 견적 중 적은 것을 사용하여 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 FMV 감소를 산정할 수 있습니다. 견적서는 자산을 피해가 발생하기 직전의 상태로 복원하기 위한 항목별 비용을 상세히 설명해야 합니다. 예상 수리 비용 피난처 방법은 $20,000이하의 재해 손실로 제한됩니다.
_**최소허용기준 방법.**_
최소허용기준 피난처 방법을 사용하면 재해 발생 직전의 상태로 자산을 복원하는 데 필요한 수리 비용에 대한 서면 선의의 추정치를 기반으로 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 FMV 감소를 파악할 수 있습니다. 예상 손실 금액을 어떻게 구했는지 보여주는 서류를 보관해야 합니다. 최소허용기준 피난처 방법은 $5,000이하의 재해 손실에 대해 사용할 수 있습니다.
_**보험 방법.**_
보험 피난처 방법을 사용하면 주택 소유자 또는 홍수 보험 회사가 작성한 보고서의 예상 손실을 기반으로 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 FMV 감소를 파악할 수 있습니다. 이러한 보고서는 자산 피해 또는 파괴로 인해 귀하가 입은 예상 손실을 명시해야 합니다.
_**연방 선포 재난 방법— 도급업자 피난처.**_
재해 지역에서 발생한 손실이 연방에서 선포한 재해로 인한 것일 경우, 도급업자 피난처 방법 또는 재난 대출 감정 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다. 도급업자 피난처 방법에 따라, 귀하는 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 FMV 감소를 결정하기 위해 독립 유자격 도급업자가 준비한 계약서에 명시된 수리에 대한 계약 가격을 사용할 수 있습니다. 귀하와 도급업자가 서명한 구속력 있는 계약의 적용을 받고, 또한 도급업자가 개인 사용 주거 부동산을 재해가 발생하기 직전의 상태로 복원하기 위한 항목별 비용을 명시하지 않는 이상 이 피난처 방법은 적용되지 않습니다.
_**연방 선포 재난 방법-재난 대출 감정.**_
재난 대출 감정 피난처 방법에 따라 연방에서 선언한 재난으로 인한 예상 손실을 식별하는 연방 기금 대출 또는 연방 정부의 대출 보증을 받기 위해 준비된 감정평가를 사용하여 개인 용도 주거 부동산의 FMV 감소를 결정할 수 있습니다.
**개인 소지품 피난처 방법.**
개인 소지품에는 일반적으로 재해 또는 도난 손실을 입은 개인이 소유한 유형 개인 자산으로 거래나 사업용으로 사용되지 않은 품목이 포함됩니다. 개인 소지품에는 시간이 지남에 따라 가치를 유지하거나 증가시키는 물품이나 특정 유형의 자산이 포함되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 국세 절차 2018-08을 참고하시기 바랍니다. 개인 소지품에 대한 피난처 방법은 최소허용기준 방법과 연방에서 선언한 재난에 대한 교체 비용 피난처 방법입니다. 
_**최소허용기준 방법.**_
최소허용기준 방법에 따라 개인 소지품의 FMV 감소를 선의로 추정할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 영향을 받는 개인 소지품과 손실을 추정하는 방법론을 설명하는 기록을 유지해야 합니다. 이 방법은 $5,000이하의 손실로 제한됩니다.
_**연방 선포 재난에 대한 교체 비용 피난처 방법.**_
연방 선포 재난에 대한 교체 비용 피난처 방법을 사용하면 연방에서 선포한 재난 직전에 재난 지역에 위치한 개인 소지품의 FMV를 결정하여 재해 또는 도난 손실 금액을 파악할 수 있습니다. 교체 비용 피난처 방법을 사용하려면 먼저 개인 소지품을 새것으로 교체할 현재 비용을 결정한 다음 개인 소지품을 소유한 해마다 해당 금액을 10%씩 줄여야 합니다. 국세 절차 2018-08의 개인 소지품 평가표를 참고하십시오. 교체 비용 피난처 방법을 사용하는 경우, 국세 절차 2018-08에 명시된 특정 예외를 제외하고 모든 개인 소지품에 해당 방법을 사용해야 합니다.
이러한 피난처 방법에는 각각 추가 규칙 및 예외가 적용됩니다. 추가적인 정보는 국세 절차 2018-08을 참고하십시오.
**피난처 손실 금액의 감소.**
피난처 방법을 통해 결정된 손실에서 제삼자가 무료로 제공한 수리의 가치 (예: 자원 봉사자가 수행하거나 기부를 통해 수행한 작업)를 차감해야 합니다. 또한 보험, 상환 또는 기타 보상 금액만큼 손실을 차감하십시오.
**양식 4684의 신고 요건.**
양식 4684에 귀하가 국세 절차 2018-08을 사용하여 재해 손실 금액을 결정했다는 진술서를 첨부하십시오. 사용되는 특정 피난처 방법도 포함하십시오. 양식 4684를 작성할 때 각 자산에 대해 라인 5 또는 라인 6 에 금액을 입력하지 마십시오. 대신, 관련 피난처 방법에 따라 결정된 FMV의 감소를 라인 7에 입력하십시오.

#### FMV 감소 파악 - 고려하지 않는 항목
일반적으로 자산의 FMV 감소를 설립할 때 다음 항목을 고려해서는 안 됩니다.
**보호 비용.**
재해 또는 도난으로부터 자산을 보호하는 데 드는 비용은 재해 또는 도난 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 보험에 가입하거나 폭풍에 대비해 집을 수리하는 데 드는 비용은 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 해당 자산이 사업용 자산인 경우, 이러한 경비는 사업 경비로 공제됩니다. 
재해 또는 도난으로부터 보호하기 위해 자산을 영구적으로 개선한다면, 개선 비용을 자산의 기초가액에 추가하십시오. 침수 방지를 위한 방벽 비용을 예로 들 수 있습니다.
_**예외.**_
적격 재해 경감 지급금과 관련하여 지출한 비용에 대해 자산의 기초가액을 증가시키거나 사업비용으로 공제할 수 없습니다 (다음의 _[재난 지역 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")_ 에서 논의).
**관련 비용.**
재해 또는 도난으로 인한 부대 비용 (예: 개인 재해 치료비, 임시 숙소, 렌트 차량 비용 등)은 재해 또는 도난 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 그러나, 손상되거나 도난당한 자산이 사업 자산인 경우, 이러한 자산은 사업 경비로 공제될 수 있습니다. 
**교체 비용.**
도난 또는 파괴된 자산을 교체하는 데 드는 비용은 재해 또는 도난 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 
**예시.**
4년 전, $300에 새 의자를 샀습니다. 지난 4월에는 홍수로 인해 의자가 파손되었습니다. 교체에 $500이 소요될 것으로 예상합니다. 홍수 전에 의자를 판매했었다면, 구매 후 4년이 지났기 때문에 $100만 받을 수 있었을 것으로 추정합니다. 의자를 보헙에 들지 않았습니다. 손실은 홍수 전 의자의 FMV인 $100입니다. 교체 비용인 $500이 아닙니다.
**감성적 가치.**
손실을 결정할 때 감성적 가치를 고려하지 않습니다. 가족의 초상화, 가보 또는 보관물이 손상, 파손 또는 도난된 경우, 손실은 자산의 조정된 기초가액에 의해 제한되는 FMV를 기반으로 해야 합니다. 
**재해 발생 지역 또는 인근 지역 자산의 시장가치 하락.**
자산 피해가 발생한 지역 또는 그 근처에 있거나 자산 피해가 다시 발생할 수 있는 지역이기 때문에 발생한 자산 가치 감소는 고려하지 않습니다. 자산의 실제 피해에 대한 손실만 고려합니다. 단, 주택이 연방 선포 재난 지역에 있는 경우 추후에 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")을 참고하십시오. 
**사진 및 감정 비용.**
재해 발생 후 촬영된 사진은 훼손된 자산의 상태와 가치를 파악하는 데 도움이 될 것입니다. 수리, 복원 또는 교체 후의 자산 상태를 보여주는 사진도 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
감정은 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 FMV의 감소를 파악하는 데 사용됩니다. 감정에 대한 자세한 내용은 앞의 [_감정_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225244 "감정."), _(FMV 감소 파악 - 고려할 항목)_ 에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
재해로 인해 손상된 자산의 가치와 상태에 대한 증거로 사용되는 사진과 감정 비용은 손실에 포함되지 않습니다. 그 비용은 세금 채무를 결정하는 데 드는 비용입니다. 2018년부터 2025년까지 과세연도에 대해 더 이상 기타 항목별 공제로 공제할 수 없습니다.
#### 조정된 기초가액
소유한 자산에 대한 투자의 척도는 그 기초가액입니다. 자산을 구입할 때, 기초가액은 대개 이에 대한 비용입니다. 상속하거나, 증여로 받거나, 비과세 교환으로 받는 등 다른 방법으로 취득한 자산의 경우 간행물 551에서 설명한 것과 같이 다른 방식으로 기초가액을 파악해야 합니다.
**상속된 재산과 섹션 1022 선택.**
2010년에 사망한 사람으로부터 재산을 상속받았으며 이 사망자 유산의 집행자가 양식 8939, ‘사망자로부터 취득한 자산의 기초가액 증가 할당액’을 사용해 섹션 1022 선택을 했다면 기초가액에 대한 특별 규칙이 적용될 것입니다
2010년에 사망한 사망자의 유산의 집행자는 사망자로부터 취득한 자산에 대해 조정된 이연 기초가액을 적용하도록 선택할 수 있습니다.
섹션 1022 선택에 관한 더 자세한 내용은 [IRS.gov/irb/2011-35_IRB#NOT-2011-66(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2011-35_IRB#NOT-2011-66)에 있는 공고 2011-66, 2011-35 I.R.B. 184를 참고하십시오. 섹션 1022에 따른 선택적 피난처 지침에 대한 정보는, [IRS.gov/irb/2011-35_IRB#RP-2011-41](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2011-35_IRB#RP-2011-41)에 있는 국세 절차 2011-41, 2011-35 I.R.B. 188를 참고하십시오.
**기초가액 조정 사항.**
자산을 소유하고 있는 동안에는 다양한 사건의 발생으로 인하여 기초가액이 변경될 수 있습니다. 기초가액은 자산에 대한 추가 또는 영구적 개선과 같은 일부 사건으로 인해 증가합니다. 기초가액은 이전 재해 손실 및 감가상각비차감 등으로 인해 감소합니다. 기초가액에 증가분을 더하고 기초가액에서 감소분을 뺀 결과가 조정된 기초가액입니다. 자산 기초가액 파악에 대한 자세한 정보는 간행물 551을 참고하십시오. 
#### 보험금 및 기타 상환
보험금 또는 기타 유형의 상환을 받는 경우 손실을 파악할 때 상환금을 차감해야 합니다. 상환을 받은 범위 내에서는 재해나 도난 손실이 없습니다.
재해가 발생한 해에 상환 청구에 대한 합리적인 회복 전망이 있는 경우, 그러한 상환을 받을 수 있는지를 합리적으로 확실하게 알기 전까지는 손실이 지속되지 않습니다. 손실의 일부 또는 전부를 상환받을 것으로 예상되는 경우, 손실을 파악할 때 예상 상환금을 차감해야 합니다. 나중에 세금을 납부할 때까지 대금을 받지 못하더라도 손실을 줄여야 합니다. 추후에 [_손실 공제 후 받은 환급금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225285 "손실 공제 후 받은 상환금")을 참고하십시오.
**상환청구 제출에 실패한 경우.**
자산이 보험에 보장되는 경우, 손실 상환을 위해 보험금 청구서를 적시에 제출해야 합니다. 보험금을 청구하지 않으면 미회수된 전액을 재해 또는 도난 손실로 공제할 수 없으며, 보험에서 보장하지 않는 손실 부분만 공제받을 수 있습니다. 
일반적으로 보험이 적용되지 않는 손실 부분 (예: 자기부담금— 최소부담금액)은 이 규칙의 적용 대상이 아닙니다.
**예시.**
귀하의 자동차 보험에는 $1,000의 자기부담금이 있는 포괄적인 보장이 포함되어 있습니다. 귀하의 보험은 폭풍으로 인한 첫 $1,000의 손해를 보상하지 않기 때문에, $1,000은 공제 가능합니다 (나중에 논의할 [$100](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225295 "$100 규칙") 그리고 [10%](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225308 "10% 규칙") 규칙 적용). 보험이 자기부담금에 대해 상환해 주지 않기 때문에 보험 청구를 하지 않는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다.
#### 상환의 종류
가장 일반적인 종류의 보상은 도난당하거나 손상된 자산에 대한 보험금 지급입니다. 다른 유형의 보상은 다음에 논의됩니다. 또한 양식 4684에 대한 설명도 확인하십시오.
**고용주 긴급 재난 기금.**
고용주의 긴급 재난 기금으로부터 돈을 받고, 그 돈을 재해 손실 공제를 청구할 자산의 복원 또는 교체에 반드시 사용해야 하는 경우, 그 돈을 재해 손실 공제를 계산할 때 반드시 고려해야 합니다. 파손되거나 손상된 자산을 교체하기 위해 사용한 금액만 고려하십시오. 
**예시.**
토네이도로 인해 귀하의 집이 큰 피해를 입었습니다. 귀하의 보험사로부터 보상받은 후의 손실은 $10,000입니다. 귀하의 고용주는 직원들을 위한 재난 기금을 마련했습니다. 기금에서 돈을 받는 직원은 손상되거나 파괴된 재산을 복원하거나 대체하는 데 사용해야 했습니다. 귀하는 기금에서 $4,000을 받았고 총액을 주택 수리에 사용했습니다. 재해 손실을 파악하려면, 고용주의 기금으로부터 받은 $4000만큼을 상환되지 않은 손실($10,000)을 줄여야 합니다. 귀하의 재해 손실에 [공제 한도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225293 "공제 한도") (나중에 논의)를 적용하기 전 금액은 $6,000입니다.
**현금 선물.**
재해 피해자로서 제외 가능한 현금 선물을 받고 그 금액을 사용할 수 있는 방법에 제한이 없는 경우, 이러한 제외 가능한 현금 선물로 재해 손실을 줄이지 않습니다. 이는 재난으로 손상된 자산에 대한 수리 비용을 지불하기 위해 해당 금액을 사용하는 경우에도 적용됩니다. 
**예시.**
태풍으로 인해 귀하의 집이 피해를 입었습니다. 친척과 이웃이 소득에서 제외 가능한 현금을 선물했습니다. 귀하는 주택 수리를 위해 현금 선물 중 일부를 사용했습니다. 현금 선물 사용에 대한 제한은 없습니다. 제외 가능한 선물이었기 때문에, 귀하가 받아서 주택 수리 비용을 지불하는 데 사용한 돈으로 손상된 주택에 대한 재해 손실을 줄이지 않습니다. 
**생활비에 대한 보험금 지급.**
다음 중 한 상황에서 생활비를 충당하기 위해 받는 보험금으로 재해 손실을 줄이지 않습니다. 
  * 재해로 인해 주 거주지를 사용할 수 없게 됨.
  * 재해 또는 재해의 위험으로 인해 정부 당국이 주 거주지에 대한 접근을 허용하지 않음.


_**소득으로 포함.**_
이러한 보험 지급액이 일시적으로 증가된 생활비보다 많은 경우, 초과 금액을 소득에 포함시켜야 합니다. 이 금액을 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 8z에 신고하십시오. 그러나, 재해가 연방 선포 재난 지역에서 발생한 경우, 그 어떤 보험금도 과세대상이 아닙니다. 추후에 _재난 지역 손실_ 에서 [_적격 재난 지원금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000118408 "적격 재난 지원금.")을 확인하십시오.
일시적으로 증가된 생활비는 귀하가 집을 사용할 수 없는 기간 동안 귀하와 귀하의 가족에게 발생한 실제 생활비와 해당 기간 일반적인 생활비의 차액입니다. 실제 생활비는 주 거주지를 잃어 발생하는 합리적이고 필요한 비용입니다. 일반적으로 이러한 비용에는 다음 금액이 포함됩니다. 
  * 적합한 주택의 임대.
  * 교통비.
  * 음식.
  * 공과금.
  * 기타 서비스.


보통 생활비는 이와 동일한 비용으로 구성되지만, 재해 또는 재해의 위협으로 발생하지 않은 비용입니다. 
**예시.**
태풍으로 인해 한 달 동안 아파트를 비우고 모텔로 이사했습니다. 보통 아파트 임대료로 한 달에 $1,400를 지불합니다. 아파트가 비워진 달에 대한 월세는 청구되지 않았습니다. 이번 달의 모텔 임대료는 $3,000이였습니다. 일반적으로 한 달에 $500의 식비를 지출합니다. 모텔에서 생활한 달의 식비는 $850이였습니다. 생활비로 보험사로부터 $2,200를 받았습니다. 다음과 같이 소득에 포함해야 하는 지급액을 결정하십시오. 
1. | 생활비에 대한 보험금 | $2,200  
---|---|---

주 거주지의 사용을 회복한 연도 또는 나중에 과세대상 부분의 보험금 지급액을 수령하는 연도의 보험금 지급액에 과세대상 금액을 포함해야 합니다. 
**예시.**
2022년 6월 토네이도로 인해 주 거주지가 파괴되었습니다. 2023년 11월에 주택을 다시 이용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 2022년과 2023년에 수령한 보험 지급액은 해당 기간의 일시적 생활비 증가액보다 $1,500이 더 많았습니다. 이 금액을 2023년 양식 1040에서 소득에 포함시킵니다. 2022년과 2023년에 지출한 생활비를 충당하기 위해 2024년에 추가 지급을 받는 경우, 해당 지급액을 2024 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR에서 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**재난 구제.**
음식, 의료 용품 및 기타 형태의 지원은 자산을 잃거나 파괴된 자산을 대체하는 경우를 제외하고는 재해 손실을 줄일 수 없습니다.

#### 손실 공제 후 받은 상환금
예상 상환 금액을 사용하여 재해 또는 도난 손실을 파악한 경우, 실제 상환을 받은 과세연도의 세금 신고서를 조정해야 할 수도 있습니다. 이 섹션에서는 조정해야 할 사항에 대해 설명합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_콘크리트 기초 악화가 있는 개인 주거지 수리를 위해 금액을 지불했으며, 본래 혹은 수정된 신고서에 이 금액을 공제했고 귀하가 (또는 귀하를 대신해 도급업자에게) Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company (CFSIC)에서 상환금을 받았다면, 이 상환금의 일부를 반드시 귀하의 총 소득에 포함 시켜야 합니다. 공표 2020-5, 2020-19 I.R.B. 796을 참고하십시오. (_[IRS.gov/irb/2020-19_IRB#ANN-2020-5(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2020-19_IRB#ANN-2020-5)_에 있음)._.
**실제 상환액이 예상보다 낮음.**
예상보다 낮은 상환금을 받은 경우, 이 차액을 합리적으로 상환을 더 이상 기대할 수 없는 연도에 다른 손실 (있는 경우)과 함께 손실로 포함하십시오.
**예시.**
2023년 다른 차량과 충돌하여 파괴되었을 때 개인 차량의 FMV는 $2,000이였습니다. 이 사고는 다른 운전자의 과실로 인해 발생했습니다. 2023년 말에 다른 차량의 소유자가 전액을 보상할 것이라는 합리적인 전망이 있었습니다. 2023년에는 공제 가능 손실이 없었습니다.
2024년 1월, 법원은 $2,000의 보상 판결을 내립니다. 그러나 7월에 다른 운전자로부터 어떤 금액도 받아낼 수 할 수 없다는 것이 명백해졌습니다. 2024년에 발생한 손실을 (2024년 개인 재해 이득을 초과하지 않는 범위 내에서) [공제 한도](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225293 "공제 한도")를 적용하여 공제할 수 있습니다 (나중에 논의).
**실제 상환액이 예상보다 높음.**
손실에 대한 공제를 신청한 후 예상보다 큰 상환액을 나중에 받는 경우, 상환액을 수령한 해에 추가 상환 금액을 소득에 포함해야 할 수 있습니다. 그러나, 기존 공제액이 이전 연도에 세금을 줄이는 데 전혀 사용되지 않았다면, 상환액의 일부는 소득에 포함시킬 필요가 없습니다. 공제를 신청한 연도에 대한 세금을 다시 계산하지 않습니다. 간행물 525에서 _복구_ 를 참고하여 소득에 포함시킬 추가 상환액에 대해 알아보십시오. 
**예시.**
2023년, 연방 선포 재난이었던 허리케인이 모터보트를 파괴했습니다. 귀하의 손실은 $3,000이며, 귀하는 보험이 $2,500을 보상할 것으로 예상했습니다. 2023년 신고서에서 항목별 공제를 하지 않았으며 표준 공제를 손실 금액만큼 증가시키지 않았습니다. 보험 회사가 손실에 대해 상환하는 경우, 상환액을 소득으로 신고하지 않습니다. 2023년 신고서에서 손실을 공제하지 않았기 때문에 금액이 $3,000 전체에 해당하는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 이 손실이 세금을 줄이지 않았습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_파괴되거나 도난당한 자산의 조정된 기초가액보다 귀하가 받은 모든 상환금의 총액이 더 높다면, 귀하는 재해나 도난에 대한 이득이 발생하게 됩니다. 이미 손실을 공제를 했고 나중에 상환을 받는 경우 나중에 얻은 이득을 나중 연도의 소득에 포함해야 할 수 있습니다. 이전 연도에 세액을 감소시킨 금액만큼의 이득을 경상 소득으로 포함하십시오. 남은 이득에 대한 신고를 나중에_[이득의 연기](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225354 "이득의 연기") _에서 설명한 대로 연기할 수 있습니다._.
**실제 상환액이 예상액과 같음.**
나중에 수령할 것으로 예상했던 상환액과 정확히 같은 금액을 받는 경우, 상환액을 소득에 포함시킬 필요가 없으며 추가 손실을 공제할 수 없습니다. 
**예시.**
2024년 12월, 연방 선포 재난인 홍수로 인해 개인 차량이 손상되었습니다. 차량의 수리 비용은 $950입니다. 귀하는 $100 자기부담금이 있는 종합보험에 가입되어 있습니다. 보험 회사가 나머지 피해에 대해 상환하기로 동의했습니다. 보험사로부터 상환이 예상되는 이유로 2024년에는 재해 손실 공제가 존재하지 않았습니다.
$100 규칙으로 인해, 지불한 $100를 자기부담금로 공제할 수 없습니다. 2025년에 보험사로부터 $850을 받는 경우, 이를 소득으로 신고하지 마십시오.
#### 공제 한도
재해 또는 도난 손실 금액을 파악한 후에는 공제 가능한 손실 금액을 파악해야 합니다.
개인 용도 자산의 재해 및 도난 손실에 대한 공제는 제한됩니다. 2018년부터 2025년까지 과세연도에 대해 개인의 개인 용도 자산의 재해 및 도난 손실은 연방 선포 재난에서 비롯된 경우에만 공제됩니다. 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 개인의 재해 및 도난 손실은 추후 논의되는 재해당 $100 및 10% 규칙의 적용을 받게 됩니다. $100 및 10% 규칙 또한 [_표 2_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225280 "표 2. 개인 용도 자산에 대한 공제 한도 규칙             ")에 요약되어 있습니다.
위의 규칙에 대한 예외로 재해 및 도난 손실 공제를 연방 선언 재난으로 인한 손실로 제한하는 것으로, 과세연도에 개인 재해 소득이 있는 경우 적용됩니다. 이 경우, 귀하는 연방에서 선언한 재난이 원인이 아닌 모든 재해 손실에 대한 귀하의 개인 재해 이득을 줄일 수 있습니다. 초과 이득은 연방 선언한 재해 손실을 줄이는 데 사용됩니다. 10% 규칙은 남아있는 모든 연방 재해 손실에 적용됩니다.
사업 자산과 소득창출 자산에 대한 손실은 이 규칙의 적용을 받지 않습니다. 단, 재해 또는 도난 손실에 사업용으로 사용했거나 임차한 주택이 연루된 경우 공제 손실이 제한될 수 있습니다. 양식 4684 섹션 B에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오. 피동적 활동에 사용된 자산의 상해 또는 도난 손실이 있는 경우, 양식 8582, ‘피동적 활동 손실 제한’ 및 이에 대한 지침을 참고하십시오.
#### $100 규칙
앞서 논의한 [개인 용도 자산](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225224 "손실 파악")에 대한 재해 또는 도난 손실을 파악한 후 이 손실에서 $100을 차감해야 합니다. 이 차감은 개인 재해 이득을 줄이기 위해 적용되는 연방에서 선언한 재해에 기인하지 않은 손실을 포함하여, 총 재해 또는 도난 손실에 각각 적용됩니다. 사건과 관련되어 있는 자산의 갯수는 중요하지 않습니다. $100 차감은 오직 한번만 적용됩니다.
**예시.**
차량에 $750 자기부담금이 있는 충돌 보험이 있습니다. 충돌로 인해 차량이 손상되었습니다. 보험 회사는 $750 자기부담금을 제외하고 피해액을 귀하에게 지불합니다. 재해 손실 금액은 자기부담금 금액만을 기준으로 합니다. 개인 용도의 자산에 대한 재해 손실 중 첫 번째 $100는 공제 대상이 아니기 때문에 재해 손실은 $650 ($750 - 100)입니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_적격 재해 손실에서 반드시 $500을 차감해야 합니다. 추후에_[재난 지역 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실") _에서 자세한 내용을 참고하십시오._.
**단일 사건.**
일반적으로, 원인과 밀접한 관련이 있는 사건은 단일 재해를 야기합니다. 동일한 폭풍으로 인한 풍수해 및 홍수 피해와 같은 두 가지 이상의 밀접한 원인으로 인한 피해가 발생한 경우는 단일 재해입니다. 또한, 주택과 진입로에 주차된 차량에 피해를 주는 토네이도와 같은 단일 재해가 두 개 이상의 자산에 피해를 줄 수 있습니다. 
**예시 1.**
토네이도가 귀하의 유람선을 파괴했습니다. 폭풍으로 일부 보트 장비도 잃었습니다. 손실액은 배가 $5,000, 장비가 $1,200이였습니다. 보험 회사에서 보트 손상에 대해 $4,500을 상환했습니다. 귀하는 장비에 대한 보험이 없습니다. 귀하의 재해 손실은 단일 이벤트로 인해 발생하며 $100 규칙이 한 번 적용됩니다. 먼저 손실을 계산한 다음 [10% 규칙](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225308 "10% 규칙")을 다음과 같이 적용하십시오 (나중에 논의). 
|  | **보트** | **장비**  
---|---|---|---  
1. | 손실  | $5,000 | $1,200  
2. | 보험금 차감 | _4,500_ | _-0-_  
3. | 상환 후 손실 | $500 | $1,200  
4. | 총 손실 | $1,700  
5. | $100 차감 | _100_  
6. | **10% 규칙 적용 전 손실** | **$1,600**  
**예시 2.**
1월에 도둑들이 귀하의 집에 침입해서 반지와 모피 코트를 훔쳤습니다. 반지에 $200, 코트에 $700의 손실을 입었습니다. 이는 단일 절도입니다. $100 규칙은 총 $900의 손실에 적용됩니다.
**예시 3.**
10월에, 허리케인 강풍이 귀하의 집에서 지붕을 날려 버렸습니다. 허리케인으로 인한 홍수로 인해 집이 더 손상되고 가구와 개인 차량이 파괴되었습니다. 이는 단일 재해로 간주됩니다. $100 규칙은 홍수와 바람으로 인한 총 손실에 적용됩니다.
**한 건 이상의 손실.**
과세연도에 두 건 이상의 재해 또는 도난 손실을 입은 경우, 각 손실에서 $100을 차감해야 합니다. 
**예시.**
지난 1월 폭풍우로 인해 가족 차량이 손상되었습니다. 보험 상환 후의 손실은 $75입니다. 지난 2월, 다른 폭풍으로 인해 귀하의 차량이 손상되었습니다. 이번에 보험 상환 후의 손실은 $90입니다. 각각의 개별 재해 손실에 $100 규칙을 적용합니다. $100이 넘는 손실을 입힌 폭풍이 없기 때문에 이 폭풍에 대해 공제를 받을 수 없습니다.
**한 사람 이상.**
두 명 이상의 개인 (공동 신고서를 제출하는 배우자 제외)이 동일한 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 손실이 있는 경우, 각 개인에게 $100 규칙이 따로 적용됩니다. 
**예시.**
허리케인 바람으로 인해 집이 손상되었고 손님의 개인 자산도 손상되었습니다. 손실에서 $100을 차감해야 합니다. 손님은 손실에서 $100를 차감해야 합니다.
_**기혼 납세자.**_
귀하와 배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하는 $100 규칙을 적용함에 있어 한명의 개인으로 취급됩니다. 자산을 공동으로 소유하든 별도로 소유하든 상관없습니다. 
귀하와 배우자가 재해 또는 도난 손실을 입어 별도의 신고를 하는 경우, 각자는 손실을 $100을 줄여야 합니다. 이는 자산을 공동으로 소유하고 있는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 한 명의 배우자가 자산을 소유하고 있는 경우, 해당 배우자만 별도 신고서 제출 시 손실 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
재해 또는 도난 손실이 임차인으로서 전체를 소유한 자산에 있는 경우, 각각 별도의 신고에 대한 손실의 2분의 1만을 공제받을 수 있습니다. 두 사람 모두 별도 신고서에서 손실에 대한 공제를 계산할 수 없습니다. 각각 손실에서 $100을 차감해야 합니다. 
**두 명 이상의 소유자.**
두 명 이상의 개인 (배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우 제외)이 공동 소유 자산에 대한 손실이 있는 경우 $100 규칙이 각각 별도로 적용됩니다. 예를 들어, 두 자매가 공동으로 소유하고 있는 집에서 함께 살고 있으며, 집에 재해 손실이 있는 경우, 자매 각자에게 $100 규칙이 별도로 적용됩니다. 
#### 10% 규칙
귀하의 AGI의 10%만큼 연방 재해 총 손실을 감소시켜야 합니다. 각 손실을 $100 줄인 후 이 규칙을 적용하십시오. 자세한 내용은, 양식 4684의 지침을 참고하십시오. 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 손익이 모두 있는 경우 추후에 이 논의의 뒷부분에서 [_손익_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225318 "손익.")을 참고하십시오.
**예시.**
9월에 연방에서 선언한 재난이었던 열대 폭풍으로 인해 귀하의 집이 손상되었습니다. 보험 상환 후의 손실액은 $2,000입니다. 손실이 발생한 연도의 AGI는 $29,500입니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 재해 손실을 파악하십시오.
1. | 보험 상환 후 손실 | $2,000  
---|---|---  
2. | $100 차감 | _100_  
3. | $100 규칙 후 손실 | $1,900  
4. | AGI $29,500의 10% 차감 | _$2,950_  
5. | **재해 손실 공제** | **-0-**  
손실 ($1,900)이 AGI ($2,950)의 10% 미만이기 때문에 재해 손실 공제가 없습니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_10% 규칙은 적격 재난 손실에는 적용되지 않습니다. 추후에_[재난 지역 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실") _에서 자세한 내용을 참고하십시오._.
**한 건 이상의 손실.**
과세연도에 두 건 이상의 재해 또는 도난 손실을 입은 경우, 각 손실을 모든 상환액 및 $100만큼 줄여야 합니다. 그 다음, 귀하의 AGI의 10%만큼 연방 재해 총 손실을 감소시켜야 합니다. 
**예시.**
3월, 연방 선포 재난인 홍수로 인해 귀하의 차량이 손상되었습니다. 귀하는 차량에 보험이 없어 보험금 상환을 받지 못했습니다. 차량에 대한 손실은 $1,800입니다. 11월, 연방 선포 재난인 또 다른 홍수로 인해 지하실이 손상되었고, 가구, 세탁기, 건조기 및 기타 물품이 완전히 파손되었습니다. 보험사로부터 상환받은 후의 지하실 물품에 대한 손실은 $2,100입니다. 홍수가 발생한 연도에 대한 AGI는 $25,000입니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 재해 손실 공제를 파악합니다. 
|  | **자동차** | **지하실**  
---|---|---|---  
1. | 손실 | $1,800 | $2,100  
2. | 사고당 $100 차감 | _100_ | _100_  
3. | $100 규칙 후 손실 | $1,700 | $2,000  
4. | 총 손실 | $3,700  
5. | AGI $25,000 의 10% 차감 | _2,500_  
6. | **재해 손실 공제** | **$1,200**  
**기혼 납세자.**
귀하와 배우자가 공동 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 귀하는 10% 규칙을 적용함에 있어 한 개인으로 취급됩니다. 자산을 공동으로 소유하든 별도로 소유하든 상관없습니다. 
별도 신고서를 제출하는 경우, 10% 규칙은 손실을 청구하는 각 신고서에 적용됩니다. 
**두 명 이상의 소유자.**
두 명 이상의 개인 (배우자가 공동으로 신고서를 제출하는 경우 제외)이 공동 소유 자산에 대한 손실이 있는 경우 10% 규칙이 각각 별도로 적용됩니다. 
**손익.**
개인 용도 자산에 대한 손실뿐만 아니라 재해 또는 도난 이득이 있는 경우, 총 이득과 총 손실을 비교해야 합니다. 각 손실을 상환금과 $100만큼 감소시킨 후 AGI의 10%만큼 연방 재해 손실을 감소시킨 후 이 작업을 수행합니다. 
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_재해 또는 도난 이득에는 연기하기로 선택한 이득이 포함되지 않습니다. 추후에_[이득의 연기](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225354 "이득의 연기") _를 참고하십시오._.
_**이득보다 손실이 많은 경우.**_
인식한 이득보다 손실이 더 많은 경우 손실에서 이득을 차감하고 AGI의 10%만큼 결과를 감소시킵니다. 나머지는 개인 용도 자산에서 공제할 수 있는 손실입니다. 
연방에서 선포한 재해에 기인하지 않은 손실이 있는 경우 양식 4684의 지침에서 _라인 14_ 를 참고하십시오. 연방에서 선언한 재난에 기인하지 않은 손실은 오직 이득을 상쇄하기 위해서만 사용할 수 있습니다. 
적격한 재난 손실이 있는 경우, 자세한 내용은 양식 4684의 지침에서 _라인 15_ 를 참고하십시오.
**예시.**
상환금과 $100을 차감한 후의 도난 손실은 $2,700입니다. 재해 이득은 $700입니다. 도난 손실은 연방에서 선언한 재난에서 비롯된 것이 아니기 때문에 손실의 $700만 사용하여 $700의 재난 이득을 상쇄할 수 있습니다.
_**손실보다 더 많은 이득을 얻는 경우.**_
인식한 이익이 손실보다 많은 경우 이익에서 손실을 차감합니다. 차액은 자본 이득으로 취급되며 스케줄 D (양식 1040)에 신고해야 합니다. 10% 규칙은 귀하의 이득에 적용되지 않습니다. 연방에서 선포한 재해에 기인하지 않은 손실이 있는 경우 양식 4684의 지침에서 _라인 14_ 를 참고하십시오. 
**예시.**
상환금과 $100을 차감한 후의 도난 손실은 $600입니다. 재해 이득은 $1,600입니다. 이득이 손실보다 많기 때문에 순 이득 $1,000 ($1,600 − $600)를 스케줄 D (양식 1040)에 신고해야 합니다.
_**추가 정보.**_
인식된 이득을 구하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은, 추후에 [_이득 파악_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225344 "이득 파악")을 참고하십시오.
#### 공제 파악
일반적으로 도난, 손상 또는 파괴된 각 품목에 대해 손실을 별도로 파악해야 합니다. 하지만 개인 용도로 소유한 부동산에는 특별한 규칙이 적용됩니다.
**부동산.**
개인 용도로 소유한 부동산에 대한 손실을 파악할 때 모든 개선 사항 (예: 건물 및 조경수 및 개선 사항이 포함된 토지)이 함께 고려됩니다. 
**예시 1.**
6월에 토네이도가 호숫가 별장을 파괴했습니다. 몇 년 전에 $144,800 (토지 $14,500 포함)의 비용이 들었습니다. (귀하의 토지는 손상되지 않았습니다.) 이것은 한 해 동안의 유일한 재해 또는 도난 손실이었습니다. 토네이도 발생 직전 자산의 FMV는 $180,000 (별장은 $14,500, 토지는 $35,000)였습니다. 토네이도 발생 직후의 FMV는 $35,000 (토지 가치)였습니다. 귀하는 보험사로부터 $130,000을 받았습니다. 토네이도가 발생한 연도에 대한 AGI는 $80,000입니다. 재해 손실에 대한 공제액은 $6,700이며, 다음과 같은 방식으로 계산됩니다.
1. | 전체 자산의 조정된 기초가액 (이 예시에서는 비용) | $144,800  
---|---|---  
2. | 토네이도 발생 이전 전체 자산의 FMV | $180,000  
3. | 토네이도 발생 이후 전체 자산의 FMV | _35,000_  
4. | 전체 자산의 FMV 감소 ( 라인 2− 라인 3) | $145,000  
5. | 손실 ( 라인 1 또는 라인 4 중 작은 값) | $144,800  
6. | 보험료 차감 | _130,000_  
7. | 상환 후 손실 | $14,800  
8. | $100 차감 | _100_

**예시 2.**
귀하는 몇 년 전에 집을 샀습니다. 귀하는 $150,000 (토지 $10,000, 주택 $140,000)을 지불했습니다. 조경용으로 $2,000을 추가로 지출했습니다. 올해 허리케인으로 인해 주택이 파괴되었습니다. 허리케인으로 인해 마당의 관목과 나무도 손상되었습니다. 이 허리케인은 한 해 동안의 유일한 재해 또는 도난 손실이었습니다. 유능한 감정가들은 자산 전체를 허리케인이 오기 전에 $175,000으로 평가했지만, 허리케인이 온 다음에는 $50,000으로 평가했습니다. 허리케인 직후, 보험 회사는 손실에 대해 $95,000을 지급했습니다. 이변 연도의 AGI는 $70,000입니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 재해 손실 공제를 파악합니다.
1. | 전체 자산의 조정된 기초가액 (이 예시에서는 대지, 건물, 조경 비용) | $152,000  
---|---|---

**개인 자산.**
개인 자산은 부동산이 아닌 모든 자산입니다. 개인 자산이 도난당하거나 인명 피해가 발생하거나 파괴된 경우 각 자산에 대한 손실을 별도로 파악해야 합니다. 그런 다음 이 별도 손실을 합산하여 총 손실을 계산하십시오. 총 손실에서 $100 및 AGI의 10%를 감소 시켜 손실 공제를 계산하십시오.
**예시 1.**
8월, 연방 선포 재난으로 결정된 폭풍이 귀하가 $18,500으로 구입한 보트를 파괴했습니다. 이것은 한 해 동안의 유일한 재해 또는 도난 손실이었습니다. 폭풍 직전의 FMV는 $17,000이였습니다. 귀하는 보험이 없었지만 배의 모터를 수리하여 $200에 판매할 수 있었습니다. 재해가 발생한 연도의 AGI는 $70,000입니다.
모터는 별도로 판매되었지만, 보트의 일부이며 별도의 자산이 아닙니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 재해 손실 공제를 파악합니다.

귀하는 6월에 자동차 사고에 연루되어 개인 자동차와 골동품 회중시계가 완전히 파괴되었습니다. 귀하는 $30,000에 자동차를 구입했습니다. 사고 직전 차의 FMV는 $17,500였습니다. 사고 직후의 FMV는 $180 (잔존 가치)였습니다. 보험 회사에서 $16,000을 상환했습니다.
시계는 보험에 들지 않았습니다. 귀하는 시계를 $250에 구입했습니다. 사고 직전의 FMV는 $500이였습니다. 같은 해에, 귀하에게는 $2,000의 대해 이득이 생겼고, 별도로 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 $5,000의 손실을 입었습니다. 이 연도에 대한 AGI는 $97,000입니다. 재해 손실 공제는 0이며, 다음과 같이 측정됩니다. 
|  | **자동차** | **시계**  
---|---|---|---  
1. | 조정된 기초가액 (원가) | $30,000 | $250

**부동산과 개인 자산 둘다.**
재해에 부동산과 개인 자산이 둘다 연루된 경우, 반드시 각 유형의 자산에 대해 손실을 별도로 파악합니다. 그러나 총 손실액에 대해 $100을 한번만 감액합니다. 그런 다음 10% 규칙을 적용하여 재해 손실 공제를 파악합니다. 
**예시.**
지난 7월, 연방 선포 재난이었던 허리케인이 토지를 포함해 $164,000을 주고 산 귀하의 집을 손상시켰습니다. 폭풍 직전의 부동산 (건물과 토지)의 FMV는 $170,000이였고 폭풍 직후의 FMV는 $10,000이였습니다. 가재도구도 손상되었습니다. 손상된 각 가재도구에 대한 손실을 별도로 파악하여 총 $600의 손실을 파악하였습니다.
집 손상에 대해 보험사로부터 $50,000을 받았지만, 가재도구에는 보험이 적용되지 않았습니다. 허리케인이 발생한 연도에 대한 AGI는 $65,000입니다. 다음과 같은 방식으로 허리케인에서 귀하의 재해 손실 공제를 파악합니다. 
1. | 부동산의 조정된 기초가액 (이 예시에서는 비용) | $164,000

**일부는 사업 용도, 일부는 개인 용도로 사용되는 자산.**
자산을 일부는 개인적 목적, 일부는 사업 또는 소득창출 목적으로 사용하는 경우, 재해 또는 도난 손실 공제는 개인 사용 부분과 사업 또는 소득창출 부분을 별도로 계산해야 합니다. 이 두 가지 사용으로 인한 손실은 두 가지 다른 방식으로 파악되기 때문에 각 손실을 별도로 파악해야 합니다. 각 손실을 파악할 때, 총비용 또는 기초가액, 재해 또는 도난 손실 전후의 FMV, 보험 또는 기타 상환액을 사업과 개인적 사용 자산에 할당하십시오. $100 규칙과 10% 규칙은 자산의 개인 용도 부분에 대한 재해 또는 도난 손실에만 적용됩니다. 
**예시.**
귀하는 임차한 토지에서 건축한 건물을 소유하고 있습니다. 귀하는 건물의 절반을 사업에 사용하고 나머지 절반에 거주하고 있습니다. 건축 비용은 $400,000이였습니다. 더 이상 개선하거나 추가한 사항이 없었습니다.
3월, 연방 정부가 재난으로 선포한 홍수로 건물 전체가 손상되었습니다. 이 건물의 FMV는 홍수 직전 $380,000, 그 후 $320,000 였습니다. 보험 회사에서 홍수 피해에 대해 $40,000을 보상했습니다. 홍수 이전의 건물의 감가상각은 총 $24,000였습니다. 홍수가 발생한 연도의 AGI는 $125,000입니다.
공제 가능한 사업상 재해 손실이 $10,000입니다. 10% 규칙으로 공제 가능한 개인 재해 손실이 없습니다. 다음과 같이 귀하의 손실 파악합니다. 
|  | **사업 부분** |  | **개인 부분**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1. | 비용 (총 $400,000) | $200,000 |  | $200,000

#### 이득 파악
귀하가 받은 보험금 또는 다른 상환금의 총액이 파괴, 손상 또는 도난당한 자산에 대한 조정된 기초가액보다 많으면, 귀하는 재해나 도난에 대한 이득이 있습니다. 이득은 다음과 같이 측정됩니다.
  * 받는 금액 (다음에 논의됨), 빼기
  * 재해나 도난 사고가 발생한 시점의 자산에 대한 조정된 기초가액. 이전의 [_조정된 기초가액_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225261 "조정된 기초가액")에서 자세한 내용을 참고하십시오.


자산의 FMV 감소가 자산의 조정된 기초가액보다 작더라도 조정된 기초가액을 사용하여 이득을 파악하십시오.
**받은 금액.**
귀하가 받는 금액에는 모든 금액 더하기 받은 자산의 가치에서 상환을 받는 데 발생하는 비용을 뺀 금액이 포함됩니다. 여기에는 손상, 파손 또는 도난된 자산에 대한 저당권 또는 기타 채무를 갚는 데 사용되는 모든 상환액도 포함됩니다. 
**예시.**
허리케인으로 인해 개인 거주지가 파괴되었고 보험 회사에서 $145,000을 보상했습니다. 귀하는 현금으로 $140,000을 받았습니다. 나머지 $5,000은 해당 부동산의 저당권 소유자에게 직접 지불되었습니다. 귀하가 받은 금액에는 담보대출에 지불한 $5,000 상환금이 포함됩니다.
**주 거주지가 파괴됨.**
주 거주지가 파괴되었기 때문에 이득이 있는 경우, 일반적으로 집을 팔거나 교환했을 때처럼, 소득에서 이득을 제외할 수 있습니다. 최대 $250,000의 이득을 제외할 수 있습니다 (부부 공동 신고의 경우 최대 $500,000). 이득을 제외하려면, 일반적으로 파괴된 날짜까지의 5년 중 적어도 2년 동안 주 거주지로서 자산을 소유 및 거주했어야 합니다. 이 예외에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 523을 참고하십시오. 초과 이득이 제외할 수 있는 금액보다 많지만 교체 자산을 구입하는 경우 초과 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 추후에 [_이득의 연기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225354 "이득의 연기")를 참고하십시오.
**이득 신고.**
일반적으로 상환금을 수령한 연도에 이득을 소득으로 신고해야 합니다. 그러나 특정 요건을 충족하고 다음의 _이득의 연기_ 에 설명된 규칙에 따라 이득 신고를 연기하기로 선택한 경우 이득을 신고할 필요가 없습니다. 
이득을 신고하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은, 추후에 [_손익 신고 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225449 "손익 신고 방법 ")을 참고하십시오.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_신고를 연기하기로 선택한 개인 용도 자산에 대한 재해 또는 도난 이득이 있고 (다음의 의 설명처럼) 개인 용도 자산에 대한 또 다른 재해 또는 도난 손실이 있는 경우, 재해 또는 도난 손실 공제를 계산할 때 연기한 이득을 고려하지 마십시오. 이전의 공제 한도 에서_[10% 규칙](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225308 "10% 규칙") _을 참고하십시오._.
#### 이득의 연기
파손 또는 도난된 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련 있는 자산의 형태로 상환을 받는 경우 이득을 신고하지 마십시오. 일반적으로 새 자산의 기초가액은 대체되는 자산의 조정 기초가액과 동일합니다.
금전 또는 다른 종류의 자산을 상환으로 받은 경우, 일반적으로 도난 또는 파괴된 자산에 대한 이득을 신고해야 합니다. 그러나 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있는 자산을 구입하거나, 나중에 논의될 특정 [교체 기간](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225379 "교체 기간") 내에 도난 또는 파손된 자산을 사용하는 경우 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 또한 해당 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있는 자산을 소유한 법인의 지배 지분 (최소 80%)을 구입하는 경우 이득 신고를 연기하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 추후에 [_법인의 지배 지분_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225373 "법인의 지배 지분.")을 참고하십시오.
손상된 자산에 대한 이득이 있는 경우, 상환금을 사용하여 자산을 복원했다면 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다.
모든 이득에 대한 신고를 연기하려면, 귀하의 교체 자산 금액이 최소 귀하가 받은 상환 금액 이상이어야 합니다. 교체 자산 비용이 상환액보다 적은 경우, 미사용 상환액까지 소득에 포함해야 합니다.
**예시.**
1970년, $18,000의 비용으로 개인 용도 바닷가 별장을 구입했습니다. 더 이상 개선하거나 추가한 사항이 없습니다. 1월에 폭풍으로 인해 집이 파손되었을 때, 이 집은 $250,000의 가치가 있었습니다. 귀하는 3월에 보험사로부터 $146,000를 받았습니다. 귀하는 $128,000 ($146,000 − $18,000)의 이득을 얻었습니다.
귀하는 집을 재건축하는 데 $144,000을 썼습니다. 이는 수령한 보험금보다 적기 때문에 소득에 $2,000 ($146,000 - $144,000)을 포함해야 합니다.
**이해관계자로부터 교체 자산 매입.**
[이해관계자](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225359 "이해관계자.") (추후 논의)로부터 교체 자산을 매입하면 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 이득 신고를 연기할 수 없습니다. 이 규칙은 다음 납세자에게 적용됩니다. 
  1. C 법인.
  2. 자본 또는 이득 지분의 50% 이상을 C 법인이 소유한 파트너쉽.
  3. 과세연도의 모든 파손 또는 도난 자산에 대한 총 실현 이득이 $100,000이상인 경우에 해당하는 모든 다른 경우 (개인, 파트너쉽 ((2)의 경우 제외) 및 S 법인 포함).


위 (3)에서 설명한 재해 및 도난의 경우, 총 이득이 $100,000이상인지 여부를 판단할 때 이득은 어떠한 손실로도 상쇄될 수 없습니다. 자산이 파트너쉽의 소유인 경우, $100,000 한도가 파트너쉽과 각 파트너에게 적용됩니다. 해당 자산이 S 법인의 소유인 경우, S 법인과 각 주주에게 $100,000 한도가 적용됩니다. 
_**예외.**_
파손되거나 도난당한 자산을 대체할 수 있는 기간 내에 이해관계자가 이해관계가 없는 사람으로부터 자산을 취득한 경우에는 이 규칙이 적용되지 않습니다. 
_**이해관계자.**_
이 규칙에 따라 이해관계자를 예로 들면, 부모와 자녀, 형제 자매, 사외주의 50% 이상을 소유한 법인 및 개인, 그리고 동일한 C 법인이 자본 또는 이득의 50% 이상을 소유한 두 파트너쉽이 포함됩니다. 이해관계자에 대한 자세한 내용은 _공제 불가 손실_ 을 _간행물 544의 2장, 이해관계자 간 판매 및 교환_ 에서 참고하십시오.
**납세자의 사망.**
납세자가 이득을 얻은 후 교체 자산을 매입하기 전에 사망하는 경우, 피상속인이 이득을 실현한 연도에 대한 이득을 신고해야 합니다. 유산 집행자 또는 재해나 도난으로 자금을 승계한 사람은 교체 자산을 매입하여 이득을 신고하는 것을 연기할 수 없습니다. 
#### 교체 자산
파손되거나 도난당한 자산을 교체할 목적으로 교체 자산을 매입해야 합니다. 증여 또는 상속으로 취득한 자산에는 해당되지 않습니다.
교체 자산을 취득하기 위해 이전 자산에 대한 상환금과 동일한 자금을 사용할 필요가 없습니다. 보험 회사로부터 받은 돈을 다른 목적으로 사용하고, 교체 자산을 구입하기 위해 돈을 빌리는 경우에도 다른 요건을 충족하는 경우 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다.
**선급금.**
파손되거나 도난당한 자산을 대체하기 위해 도급업자에게 미리 돈을 지불하는 경우, 교체 기간이 끝나기 전에 완료되지 않는 한 교체 자산을 구입한 것으로 간주되지 않습니다. 추후에 [_교체 기간_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225379 "교체 기간")을 참고하십시오. 
**서비스 또는 용도와의 유사성 또는 관련성.**
교체 자산은 대체되는 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있어야 합니다. 
_**목재 손실.**_
재해 (강풍, 지진 또는 화산 폭발)로 인해 쓰러진 목재 판매 수익금으로 구입한 입목 (토지 제외)은 교체 자산으로 인정됩니다. 지정된 교체 기간 내에 입목을 구입한 경우 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 
_**소유자-사용자.**_
소유자-사용자인 경우, “유사하거나 관련 있는 서비스 또는 용도”란 교체 자산은 교체되는 자산과 동일한 방식의 기능을 해야 함을 의미합니다. 
**예시.**
귀하의 집은 화재로 파괴되었고 보험금 식료품점에 투자했습니다. 교체 자산이 파손된 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있지 않습니다. 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있으려면, 교체 자산도 귀하가 집으로 사용해야 합니다.
_**재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지.**_
연방에서 선포한 재난 지역에 위치한 경우 주 거주지 (또는 주택 내부 물품)의 손상 또는 파손과 관련된 교체 자산에는 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 자세한 내용은, 나중에 [_재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지에서 실현된 이득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100050957 "재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지에서 실현된 이득")을 참고하십시오.
_**소유자-투자자.**_
소유자-투자자인 경우, “유사하거나 관련 있는 서비스 또는 용도”란, 모든 교체 자산이 대체되는 유사한 서비스 또는 용도 관계를 가져야 함을 의미합니다. 다음 모든 사항을 확인하고 결정합니다. 
  * 자산이 귀하에게 유사한 서비스인지 여부.
  * 자산과 관련된 사업상의 위험성.
  * 관리, 서비스 및 임차인과의 관계에서 자산이 요구하는 사항.


**예시.**
귀하는 제조 회사에 임대한 토지와 건물을 소유하고 있었습니다. 건물이 토네이도로 파손되었습니다. 교체 기간 동안, 귀하는 새 건물을 시공하였습니다. 새 건물을 도매 식료품 창고용으로 임대했습니다. 교체 자산도 임대 자산이기 때문에, 다음 모든 항목에서 유사성이 있는 경우 두 자산은 유사하거나 관련이 있는 서비스 또는 용도로 간주됩니다. 
  * 관리 활동.
  * 임차인에게 제공하는 서비스의 양과 종류.
  * 자산과 관련된 사업상의 위험성.


_**연방 선포 재난 지역에 위치한 사업 또는 소득창출 자산.**_
파손된 사업 또는 소득창출 자산이 연방 선포 재난 지역에 있는 경우, 어떤 사업에서 사용하기 위해 취득한 유형의 교체 자산은 파손된 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련이 있는 것으로 간주합니다. 교체 자산은 연방 선포 재난 지역에 위치할 필요가 없습니다. 자세한 내용은, 나중에 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")을 참고하십시오.
**법인의 지배 지분.**
손상, 파손 또는 도난당한 자산의 서비스 또는 용도와 관련되거나 유사한 자산을 소유한 법인의 지배 지분을 취득하여 자산을 교체할 수 있습니다. 지배 지분을 제공하는 주식 가격이 귀하의 자산에 대해 받은 금액 (상환) 이상인 경우 전체 이득에 대한 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 모든 종류의 의결권 주식 합산 80% 이상과 다른 모든 종류의 주식 총수의 80% 이상을 보유한 주식을 소유하고 있는 경우 지배 지분을 보유하게 됩니다. 
_**법인의 자산의 기초가액 조정.**_
연기된 이득이 있는 경우, 귀하가 지배권을 획득한 시점에 법인이 보유하고 있던 자산의 기초가액을 그 연기된 이득의 금액만큼 감소시켜야 합니다. 법인 주식의 조정된 기초가액 이하로 법인 자산의 기초가액을 줄일 필요가 없습니다. (연기된 이득 금액에 따라 감액한 후 결정). 
이 절감액을 아래와 같은 순서로 다음 자산 등급에 할당하십시오. 
  1. 파손 또는 도난된 자산과 유사하거나 관련이 있는 서비스 또는 용도와 관련된 자산.
  2. (1)에서 차감되지 않은 감가상각 자산.
  3. 다른 모든 자산.


두 개 이상의 자산이 같은 등급에 속하는 경우, 해당 등급 모든 자산의 조정된 기초가액에 비례하여 각 자산에 감소분을 할당하십시오. 단일 자산의 감소된 기초가액은 0보다 작을 수 없습니다. 
**주 거주지 교체.**
주 거주지 파손으로 인해 받은 상환금이 소득에서 제외할 수 있는 금액보다 많은 경우 (이전의 [_주 거주지 파손_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225348 "주 거주지가 파괴됨.")을 _이득 파악_ 에서 참고), 유사하거나 관련이 있는 서비스 또는 용도의 교체 자산을 구입하여 초과 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 초과 이득 총액의 신고를 연기하려면, 교체 자산의 금액이 적어도 파손으로 인해 받은 금액에서 제외된 이득을 뺀 금액이어야 합니다. 
또한, 이 규칙에 따라 이득의 일부를 신고하는 것을 연기하는 경우, 파손된 자산을 소유하고 주 거주지으로 사용한 기간 동안 교체 자산을 소유하고 주 거주지으로 사용한 것으로 간주합니다. 
**교체 자산의 기초가액.**
교체 자산의 기초가액 (비용)을 연기된 이득 금액만큼 줄여야 합니다. 이러한 방식으로, 귀하가 교체 자산을 처분하기 전까지 이득에 대한 과세가 연기됩니다. 
**예시.**
귀하가 한 번도 거주한 적이 없었던 임대 주택이 화재로 파괴되었습니다. 보험 회사는 조정된 기초가액이 $62,000였던 자산에 대해 $67,000을 보상했습니다. 귀하는 이 재해로부터 $5,000의 이득을 얻었습니다. 교체 기간 내에 $110,000에 다른 임대 주택을 건설한 경우 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 새로운 임대 주택에 모든 상환금 (이득 전체 포함)을 재투자하게 됩니다. 새 임대 주택의 기초가액은 $105,000입니다. (비용 $110,000 − 연기된 이득 $5,000).
#### 교체 기간
이득의 신고를 연기하려면 지정된 기간 내에 교체 자산을 구매해야 합니다. 이 기간이 교체 기간입니다.
교체 기간은 자산이 손상, 파손 또는 도난된 날로부터 시작됩니다.
교체 기간은 일반적으로 귀하의 이득의 일부가 실현된 첫 번째 과세연도가 종료된 후 2년 후에 종료됩니다.
**예시.**
귀하는 역년 납세자입니다. 휴가를 보내는 동안, $2,200의 값진 골동품 가구가 집에서 도난당했습니다. 2024년 7월 7일에 집으로 돌아왔을 때 도난을 발견했습니다. 보험 회사가 도난 사건을 조사했지만, 2025년 1월 22일 $3,000을 지급하기 전까지 귀하의 사건을 해결하지 않았습니다. 2025년에 도난 피해 보상을 통해 처음 이득을 얻었으므로, 2027년 12월 31일까지 자산을 교체해야 합니다.
**재난 지역의 주거지.**
주거지 (또는 주택 내부 물품)이 연방 선포 재난 지역에 있는 경우, 교체 기간은 일반적으로 귀하의 이득의 일부가 실현된 첫 번째 과세연도가 종료된 후 4년 후에 종료됩니다. 추후에 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")을 참고하십시오. 
**예시.**
귀하는 역년 납세자입니다. 2024년 9월에 허리케인으로 인해 주택이 파괴되었습니다. 2024년 12월에 보험회사가 귀하 주택의 조정 기초가액보다 $3,000을 더 지급했습니다. 주택이 위치한 지역은 연방 선포 재난 지역이 아닙니다. 2024년에 재해 피해 보상을 통해 처음 이득을 얻었으므로, 2026년 12월 31일까지 자산을 교체할 수 있습니다. 주택이 연방 선포 재난 지역에 있었다면, 2028년 12월 31일까지 자산을 교체해야 합니다.
.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_다른 사건에 대해서는 교체 시기가 다를 수 있습니다. 자산 수용 이후에 교체 시기에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 544의 1장에서 비자발적 전환을 참고하십시오. 기후 관련 매각 혹은 가축의 교환 이후에 교체 시기에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 225의 11장을 참고하십시오._.
**연장.**
교체 기간 연장을 요청할 수 있습니다. 교체 기간 종료 이전에 연장을 요청해야 합니다. 일반적으로, 연장 요청은 교체 기간 또는 연장된 교체 기간이 끝날 때까지 이루어지거나 승인되지 않습니다.
_**연장에 관하여.**_
연장은 보통 1년 이하의 기간으로 제한됩니다. 높은 시장 가치 또는 교체 자산의 희소성은 연장을 허가할 충분한 근거가 되지 않습니다. 교체 자산이 건설 중이고 교체 기간 내에 공사를 완료할 수 없다는 사실을 명확히 입증하는 경우, 해당 기간의 연장을 허가받을 수도 있습니다.
_**요청하기.**_
교체 시기 요청서를 877-477-9193로 팩스로 보내거나, Internal Revenue Service, 985 Michigan Ave., Stop 16, Detroit, MI 48226로 우편으로 보내서 교체 시기를 요청할 수 있습니다. 이를 제출할때는 커버 표지와 함께 다음과 같은 정보가 포함되어야 합니다.
  * 날짜.
  * 귀하의 성명, 직함, 전화번호, 및 주소
  * Attention: SB/SE Field Examination Area Director [Your State]. (받는이: 소규모 사업체/자영업 현장 감사 지역 책임자 [귀하의 주])
  * Subject: 1033 Extension Request for Replacement Period of Involuntarily Converted Property. (제목: 비자발적으로 변경된 자산의 교체 시기 1033 연장 요청)
  * 팩스된 페이지 수 (팩스 커버 표지 포함).


_**요청에 포함해야 할 내용.**_
귀하의 요청서에는 연장이 필요한 이유를 설명하는 모든 세부 정보가 포함되어야 합니다. 다음과 같은 정보를 제공하십시오:
  1. 납세자의 성명, 주소, 납세자 식별 번호,
  2. 전환된 자산에 대한 자세한 설명,
  3. 자산이 전환된 날짜,
  4. 전환된 자산의 조정된 기초가액,
  5. 수령한 돈의 금액과 받은 날짜,
  6. 이득이 발생한 비자발적 전환 및 관련 이득의 연기가 포함된 신고서의 사본, 그리고
  7. 자산을 대체하기 위해 취한 조치에 대한 설명.


_**교체 기간 이후에 제출.**_
다만, 정당한 지연 사유가 있는 경우에는 교체 기간이 종료한 후 합당한 기간 내에 신청서를 제출할 수 있습니다. 교체 기간 내에 교체하지 않은 데 합리적인 이유가 있음을 입증할 수 있는 경우 연장 요청이 승인될 수 있습니다.
#### 재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지에서 실현된 이득
미국 대통령이 재난의 결과로 연방의 지원을 보증하기 위해 선포한 지역에 주 거주지가 위치해 있고, 재난으로 인해 주택이나 내부 물품이 손상되거나 파손된 경우 다음 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이 규칙은 주거지인 임대 주택에서 손상 또는 파손된 자산에 대해 보험금을 받는 세입자에게도 적용됩니다.
  1. 주택 내부 물품 중 일부였던 기록되지 않은 개인 자산에 대해 받은 보험금에 대해서는 어떠한 이득도 인정되지 않습니다.
  2. 주택 또는 그 내부 물품에 대해 수령하는 보험금은 단일 자산 항목에 대해 수령한 것으로 취급되며, 주택 또는 그 내부 물품의 서비스 또는 용도와 유사하거나 관련된 모든 교체 자산은 해당 단일 자산 항목과 유사하거나 관련이 있는 서비스 또는 용도로 취급됩니다. 따라서 해당 단일 자산 항목에 대해 수령한 보험금이 교체 자산 비용을 초과하는 범위 내에서만 이득을 인식하도록 선택할 수 있습니다.
  3. 귀하가 주 거주지 또는 그 내부 물품에 대한 보험금 또는 기타 상환금 수령으로 인한 이득을 연기하기로 선택한 경우, 교체 자산을 구입해야 하는 기간은 이득의 일부가 실현된 첫 과세연도가 종료된 후 4년까지 연장됩니다.


이득을 연기하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은, 추후에 [_이득을 연기하는 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225390 "이득을 연기하는 방법")을 참고하십시오. 
**예시.**
2024년에 연방 선포 재난 지역에서 발생한 토네이도로 인해 주 거주지와 내부 물품이 완전히 파괴되었습니다. 2024년에 주택에 대해 $200,000, 주택 내부에 있었던 예정되지 않은 개인 자산에 대해 $25,000, 보석에 대해 $5,000, 우표 수집품에 대해 $10,000의 보험금을 받았습니다.
예정되지 않은 개인 자산에 대해 받은 $25,000에는 아무런 이득도 실현되지 않습니다.
보석과 우표 수집품은 귀하의 집에 보관되어 있었으며 보험 약관에 따라 예정된 자산이었습니다. 귀하의 주택과 내부 물품의 비자발적 전환에 의한 이득을 인식하는 목적으로 귀하의 주택과 대체 내부 물품은 단일 항목 자산으로 고려됩니다,
나머지 $215,000의 보험금을 대체 주택과 대체 내부 물품에 재투자하는 경우, 귀하의 주택, 보석, 또는 우표 수집품에 대한 이득을 연기하도록 선택할 수 있습니다.
나머지 $215,000의 보험금 보다 적은 금액을 대체 주택과 대체 내부 물품에 재투자하는 경우, 해당 $215,000의 보험금이 대체 주택과 대체 내부 물품에 투자한 금액을 초과하는 범위 내에서 이득을 인식해야 할 수도 있습니다.
간행물 523에서 주거지의 파괴에 대한 보험금 수령을 비롯한 매각에서 제외할 수 있는 이득에 대한 더 자세한 내용을 보십시오.
이득을 연기하려면, 2029년 이전에 교체 자산을 구입해야 합니다. 교체 자산의 기초가액은 비용에서 지연된 이득을 절감한 금액과 같습니다.
#### 이득을 연기하는 방법
귀하는 이득이 있는 연도의 세금 신고서에서 귀하의 선택을 신고함으로써 재해 또는 도난으로 인한 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 귀하는 이득을 초래하는 보험금 또는 기타 상환금을 수령한 연도에 이득이 있습니다.
파트너쉽 또는 법인이 도난당하거나 파손된 자산을 소유한 경우, 오직 파트너쉽 또는 법인만이 이득 신고 연기를 선택할 수 있습니다.
**요구되는 진술서.**
이득이 있는 연도의 신고서에 진술서를 첨부해야 합니다. 이 서류에는 다음 항목들이 포함되어야 합니다. 
  * 재해 또는 도난 날짜와 세부 정보.
  * 재해 또는 도난으로 받은 보험금 또는 기타 상환금.
  * 이득을 산정한 방법. 


_**신고서 제출 전 취득한 교체 자산.**_
이득이 발생한 연도의 신고서를 제출하기 전에 교체 자산을 취득하는 경우, 서류에 다음 모든 항목에 대한 자세한 정보 또한 포함되어야 합니다. 
  * 교체 자산.
  * 연기된 이득.
  * 연기된 이득을 반영한 기초가액.
  * 소득으로 신고하는 모든 이득. 


_**신고서 제출 후 취득한 교체 자산.**_
이득이 발생한 연도의 신고서를 제출 후 교체 자산을 취득할 의사가 있는 경우, 필수 교체 기간 내에 자산의 교체를 선택한다는 내용도 서류에 명시되어야 합니다. 
그런 다음 교체 자산을 취득한 연도의 신고서에 또다른 서류를 첨부해야 합니다. 이 서류에는 교체 자산에 대한 자세한 정보가 포함되어야 합니다.
교체 자산의 일부를 한 연도에 취득하고 나머지를 다른 연도에 취득하는 경우, 연도마다 서류를 작성해야 합니다. 서류에는 해당 연도에 취득한 교체 자산에 대한 자세한 정보가 포함되어야 합니다. 
**교체 자산 대체.**
세금 신고서에 첨부된 서류에서 교체 자산으로 지정한 적격 교체 자산을 취득한 후에는, 나중에 다른 적격 교체 자산으로 대체할 수 없습니다. 교체 기간 내에 다른 자산을 취득하는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 그러나 기존 교체 자산이 적격 교체 자산이 아닌 것을 알게 된 경우 (교체 기간 내), 새로운 적격 교체 자산으로 교체할 수 있습니다. 
**수정된 신고서.**
다음 중 해당하는 경우가 있다면 이득이 있는 과세연도에 대한 수정된 신고서 (개인은 양식 1040-X 사용)를 제출해야 합니다. 
  * 필수 교체 기간 및 연장 기간 내에 교체 자산을 취득하지 않은 경우. 이 수정된 신고서에서 이득을 신고하고 추가 세금을 납부해야 합니다.
  * 필수 교체 기간 및 연장 기간 내에 교체 자산을 취득했지만, 재해 및 절도에 대해 받는 금액보다 적은 금액으로 취득한 경우. 이 수정된 신고서에는 연기할 수 없는 이득 부분을 신고하고 추가 세금을 납부해야 합니다. 


**3년 한도.**
이득에 대한 세금 부과 기간은 다음 중 하나를 해당 지역의 IRS 국장에게 통보한 날로부터 3년 후에 종료됩니다. 
  * 자산을 교체했음.
  * 자산을 교체할 의향이 없음.
  * 교체 기간 내에 자산을 교체하지 않음. 


**의사 변경.**
교체 기간 종료 전 언제든지 이득의 신고 또는 연기 의사를 변경할 수 있습니다. 
**예시.**
2023년 연방 선포 재난으로 인해 자산이 파손되었습니다. 보험 회사에서 $10,000을 상환했고, 그중 $5,000은 이득이었습니다. 2023년 (이득 실현 연도) 신고서에서 $5,000의 이득을 신고했고 세금을 납부했습니다. 2024년, 교체 자산을 구입하였습니다. 교체 자산의 비용은 $9,000입니다. 상환액 $1,000을 제외한 모든 금액을 재투자했기 때문에, 이제 $4,000 ($5,000 − $1,000)의 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다.
이득 신고를 연기하려면, 양식 1040-X을 사용하여 2023년도 수정된 신고서를 제출하십시오. 이전에 재해로부터 얻은 전체 이득을 신고했지만, 이제 교체 자산에 지출하지 않은 상환액 일부와 동일한 이득의 일부 ($1,000)만을 신고하려 한다는 설명을 첨부해야 합니다. 
#### 손익 신고 시기
**이득.**
귀하가 받은 보험금 또는 상환금 액수가 파괴되거나 도난당한 자산에 대한 조정된 기초가액보다 많으면, 재해나 도난에 대한 이득이 있습니다. 앞에서 설명한 [이득 신고를 연기](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225390 "이득을 연기하는 방법")하기로 선택하지 않는 한 상환을 받는 연도의 소득에 이 이득을 포함해야 합니다. 
**손실.**
일반적으로, 오직 재해가 발생한 과세연도에만 상환받을 수 없는 재해 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이는 파손된 자산을 이 후 연도까지 수리하거나 교체하지 않는 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. (그러나 예외에 대하여 추후에 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실")을 참고하십시오.) 
자산이 도난당한 것을 발견한 연도에만 상환받을 수 없는 도난 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다. 
재해가 발생한 해에 상환 청구에 대한 합리적인 회복 전망이 있는 경우, 그러한 상환을 받을 수 있는지를 합리적으로 확실하게 알기 전까지는 손실을 입은 것이 아닙니다. 재해 또는 도난 손실의 일부의 상환 여부가 확실하지 않은 경우, 상환되지 않을 것이라고 합리적으로 확신하는 과세연도가 될때까지 해당 부분을 공제하지 마십시오. 손실을 입은 시기는 이후의 과세연도입니다. 
_**예금 손실.**_
귀하의 손실이 부도 또는 파산한 금융 기관의 예금 손실인 경우, 이전의 [_예금 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225213 "예금 손실")을 참고하십시오. 
_**임차인의 손실.**_
타인으로부터 자산을 임대하는 경우, 손실에 대한 부채가 결정된 연도에 해당 자산에 대한 손실을 공제할 수 있습니다. 이는 손실이 발생했거나 부채가 다른 연도에 지급된 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 임대차에 따른 부채가 합리적으로 정확하게 결정될 때까지 공제할 수 없습니다. 부채는 회복 청구가 해결, 판결 또는 폐기될 때 결정될 수 있습니다. 
#### 재난 지역 손실
이 섹션에서는 연방 선포 재난 지역 손실에 적용되는 특별 규칙에 대해 설명합니다. 여기에는 손실을 공제할 수 있는 시기, 손실 청구 방법, 재난 지역 거주지 처리 방법 및 연기할 수 있는 세금 신고 기한에 대한 정보가 포함되어 있습니다. 연방 재난 관리청 (FEMA)의 전화번호도 기재되어 있습니다. (추후에 [_연방 재난 관리청 (FEMA)에 문의하기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225448 "연방 재난 관리청 \(FEMA\)에 문의하기")를 참고하십시오.)
재난 손실은 미국 대통령이 스태포드 법에 따라 연방 정부의 지원을 보장하기 위해 결정한 지역에서 발생한 연방 선포 재난에서 비롯된 손실입니다. 재난 지역에는 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)을 보장하는 지역이 포함됩니다. 연방 선포 재난에는 중대 재난 또는 긴급 선포가 포함됩니다.
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_스태포드 법에 따른 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)이 요구되는 지역 목록은_[FEMA.gov/Disaster(영어)](https://www.fema.gov/disasters)_에서 확인할 수 있습니다._.
**FEMA 재난 선포 번호.**
연방 선포 재난으로 인한 재해나 도난 손실을 신고하는 경우, 확인란에 체크 표시를 하고 FEMA에서 지정한 DR 또는 EM 선언 번호를 2024 양식 4684 라인 1의 공란에 입력하십시오. 연방 선포 재난 및 FEMA 재난 선포 번호 목록은 [FEMA.gov/Disaster(영어)](https://www.fema.gov/disasters)에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
FEMA 재난 선포 번호는 알파벳 “DR”과 4개의 숫자, 또는 알파벳 “EM”과 4개의 숫자로 구성됩니다. 예를 들어, 테네시주 열대성 폭풍 헬렌 입력 공간에 “DR-4832”를 입력하십시오.
**재난 연도.**
재난 연도는 연방에서 선포한 재난에서 비롯된 손실을 입은 과세연도입니다. 일반적으로, 재난이 발생한 연도에 재난 손실을 입습니다. 그러나 재난이 발생한 이 후 연도에 재난 손실을 입을 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어, 합리적인 회복 전망이 있는 상환 청구가 있는 경우, 상환을 받을지 여부가 합리적으로 확실히 확인될 때까지 상환을 받을 수 있는 어떤 부분의 손실도 입지 않습니다.
**손실 공제 시기.**
일반적으로 재난 연도에 재해 손실을 공제해야 합니다. 그러나 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)이 요구된 지역에서 발생한 연방 선포 재난으로 인한 재해 손실이 있는 경우, 재난 연도 직전 과세연도의 신고서 또는 수정된 신고서에서 해당 손실을 공제하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이 선택을 하면 손실은 전년도에 발생한 것으로 처리됩니다. 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)이 요구되는 지역 목록은 FEMA 웹 사이트 [FEMA.gov/Disaster(영어)](https://www.fema.gov/disasters)에 있습니다.
재난 연도에 대한 기존 신고서 (연장 없이) 제출 마감일 후 6개월이 되는 날짜 또는 그 이전에 전년도 재난에 대한 재해 손실을 선택해야 합니다. 역년 납세자인 경우, 2024년에 발생한 재해 손실을 청구하기 위해 2025년 10월 15일까지 2023년 세금 신고서를 수정해야 합니다.
**전년도 손실 공제 방법.**
이미 전년도 신고서를 제출한 경우, 수정된 신고서를 제출하여 해당 연도의 소득에 대해 재난 손실 청구를 선택할 수 있습니다. 개인은 수정된 신고서를 제출할 때 양식 1040-X를 사용합니다. (추후에 [_양식 1040-X에서 손실을 신고하는 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100052451 "양식 1040-X에서 손실을 신고하는 방법.")을 참고하십시오.)
이 선택을 하려면, 2023년 양식 4684의 섹션 D의 파트 I을 작성하고 재난 손실 공제를 청구하는 2023년 신고서 또는 수정된 신고서에 첨부하십시오.
재난 연도에 대한 기존 신고서 (연장 없이) 제출 마감일 후 6개월이 되는 날짜 또는 그 이전에 전년도 손실 공제를 선택해야 합니다. 개인 역년 납세자의 경우, 2023년 신고서에서 2024년 재난 손실을 선택하는 마감일은 2025년 10월 15일입니다. 기존 또는 수정된 2023년 신고서에서 이러한 손실을 청구하는 방법에 대한 자세한 정보는 2023년 양식 4684의 지침을 참고하십시오.
재난 연도의 세금 신고서에 재난 손실에 대한 공제를 청구하고 전년도의 손실을 공제하려면, 이전에 공제된 손실을 제거하기 위한 수정된 신고서를 재난 손실 공제를 포함하는 전년도 신고서 또는 수정된 신고서를 제출한 날짜 또는 그 이전 날짜에 제출해야 합니다. 
.![This is an Image: taxtip.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/taxtip.gif)_전년도 신고서에 적격 재난 손실을 청구하면 해당 연도에 대한 세금이 낮아져 현금 환급이 발생하거나 환급이 증가할 수도 있습니다._.
_**전년도 손실 공제에 대한 선택 철회.**_
직전 과세연도에 연방 선포 재난 손실 공제에 대한 2024년 재난 연도 선택을 철회하려면, 2023년 양식 4684의 섹션 D의 파트 II를 작성하십시오. 작성 완료된 섹션 D를 전년도 수정된 신고서에 첨부하십시오. (즉, 2024년 재난 연도 선택을 철회하기 위해 수정된 2023년 신고서).
선택을 철회하는 수정된 신고서는 선택 마감일 이후 90일이 되는 날짜 또는 그 이전 **그리고** 재난 손실이 포함된 연도의 신고서 또는 수정된 신고서를 제출한 날짜 또는 그 이전에 제출해야 합니다.
수정된 신고서 (이전 재난 손실 선택 취소)는 선택 철회의 결과로 인한 세액을 다시 산정해야 합니다. 철회의 결과로 발생한 세금과 이자를 납부하기 위한 조치를 취해야 합니다.
**적격 재난 손실.**
적격 재난 손실에는 다음 사유로 인한 개인의 재해 또는 개인 용도 자산의 도난 손실도 또한 포함됩니다. 
  * 2016년 스태포드 법 섹션 401에 따라 대통령이 선포한 중대 재난,
  * 허리케인 하비, 
  * 열대 폭풍 하비, 
  * 허리케인 어마, 
  * 허리케인 마리아, 
  * 2017년과 2018년 1월 캘리포니아 산불 및
  * 스태포드 법 섹션 401에 따라 대통령이 선포한 중대 재난으로, 2018년과 2019년 12월 21일 사이에 발생했으며 2020년 1월 19일 이후로는 지속되지 않음 (사전 구제 조치를 받은 2018년 1월 캘리포니아 산불로 인한 재해 제외), 그리고
  * 대통령이 2020년 1월 1일과 2025년 2월 10일 기간 사이에 선포한 중대 재난. 또한 이 재난은 사건 발생 기간이 2019년 12월 28일 당일 또는 그 이후, 그리고 2024년 12월 12일 당일 또는 그 전 이어야 하며, 2025년 1월 11일 이전에 끝났어야 합니다.


### 비고.
적격 재난 손실의 정의에는 오직 코로나-19를 이유로만 선포된 대형 재난에는 연장되지 않습니다.
적격 재난 손실을 입은 경우, 재해 손실 공제를 청구할 자격이 있으며, 이전 과세연도에 손실을 청구하기로 선택할 수 있습니다.
[IRS.gov/DisasterTaxRelief](https://www.irs.gov/ko/newsroom/tax-relief-in-disaster-situations)에서 이 재난과 관련된 날짜 특정 선언 및 더 많은 정보를 보십시오.
**증가된 표준 공제 신고.**
양식 4684의 라인 15에 순 적격 재난 손실이 있고 항목별 공제를 하지 않은 경우, 스케줄 A (양식 1040)를 사용하여 다음과 같이 증가된 표준 공제를 청구할 수 있습니다. 
  1. 양식 4684 라인 15의 금액을 스케줄 A의 라인 16 옆에 있는 점선에 입력하고 “Net Qualified Disaster Loss” (순 적격 재난 손실)이라는 설명을 입력합니다.
  2. 또한, 라인 16옆의 점선에 표준 공제 금액과 “Standard Deduction Claimed With Qualified Disaster Loss” (적격 재난 손실이 있는 표준 공제 청구)이라는 설명을 입력합니다.
  3. 이 두 금액을 합쳐서 스케줄 A의 라인 16과 양식 1040 또는 1040-SR의 라인 12에 입력합니다.


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_표준 공제에 대한 AMT 조정사항은 순 적격 재난 손실에 소급적으로 적용이 불가능합니다. 2024년 양식 6251, ‘개인의 대체 최저세’도 제출하는 납세자는 양식 4684의 지침을 참고하십시오._.
**재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지.**
귀하의 주 거주지가 연방 선포 재난 지역에 위치했으며, 주택을 수리하거나 교체하는 비용을 위해 상환금을 사용했다면 이득 신고를 연기할 수 있습니다. 만약 귀하의 주 거주지 (또는 이의 구조물)가 재난 지역에 위치했다면, 주 거주지의 손상 및 파괴와 관련된 교체 자산에 대한 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이전의 [_재난 지역의 주택에서 실현된 이득_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100050957 "재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지에서 실현된 이득")에서 자세한 내용을 참고하십시오. 
**재난으로 인해 안전하지 않게 되버린 집.**
귀하의 집이 연방 선포 재난 지역에 위치한 경우, 주 또는 지방 정부가 재난으로 인해 더 이상 거주하기가 안전하지 않은 이유로 집을 철거하거나 이전하라고 명령할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 가치의 손실을 재난으로 인한 재해 손실로 처리하십시오. 주 또는 지방 정부는 해당 지역이 재난 지역으로 선포된 후 120일 이내에 집을 철거하거나 이전하라는 명령을 내려야 합니다. 
개인 용도 자산의 재해 손실과 동일한 방식으로 손실을 파악하십시오. (이전의 [_손실 파악_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225224 "손실 파악")을 참고하십시오.) FMV의 감소를 결정할 때, 집을 이전하거나 철거하기 전 집의 가치를 재해 후의 FMV로 사용하십시오. 
_**안전하지 않은 집.**_
다음 두 가지가 모두 적용되는 경우에만 집이 안전하지 않은 것으로 간주됩니다. 
  * 귀하의 집이 재난 이전보다 재난 이후에 상당히 더 위험한 경우.
  * 그 위험이 재난으로 인한 미래의 파괴 위험이 상당히 증가했기 때문인 경우. 


**예시.**
심각한 태풍으로 인해 대통령은 귀하가 거주하는 카운티를 연방 재난 지역으로 선포했습니다. 귀하의 집은 태풍으로 작은 피해만 입었지만, 한 달 후 카운티에서는 철거 명령을 내립니다. 이 명령은 태풍으로 인한 인근의 산사태로 인해 집이 안전하지 않다는 판단에 기반한 것입니다. 산사태로 인해 안전하지 않게 되었기 때문에 집의 가치가 손실되는 것은 재난으로 인한 재해 손실로 처리됩니다. 가치 손실은 재난 발생 직전과 재난 발생 직후 집의 FMV 차이입니다. 
_**손실 공제 파악.**_
전년도 손실을 공제하도록 선택할 때, 앞서 언급한 [적격 재난 손실](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink100079131 "적격 재난 손실.")이 없는 경우, 재난 발생 전 해에 발생한 것처럼 일반적인 재해 손실 규칙에 따라 손실을 계산해야 합니다. 
**예시.**
2024년 9월에 허리케인으로 인해 주 거주지가 파손되고 가구가 파괴되었습니다. 이것은 한 해 동안의 유일한 재해 손실이었습니다. 집이 2024년 9월 FEMA가 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘 다)을 위해 지정한 연방 선포 재난 지역에 있습니다. 집과 토지의 비용은 $134,000이였습니다. 재난 발생 직전의 FMV는 $147,500이였고 재난 직후의 FMV는 $100,000이였습니다. 가구의 각 항목에 대한 손실을 별도로 파악했고 (이전의 [_공제 파악_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225327 "공제 파악") 참고) 총 가구 손실이 $3,000이 되었습니다. 귀하의 보험은 이런 재해 손실에 대한 보장을 제공하지 않으며, 귀하의 집이나 가구에 대한 상환도 기대할 수 없습니다.
귀하는 재난에 대한 재해 손실을 청구하기 위해 2023년 신고서를 수정하기로 선택했습니다. 2023년 신고서의 AGI는 $71,000입니다. 적격한 재해 손실에 적용되는 규칙을 사용하여 다음과 같이 재해 손실을 파악합니다.
|  | **집** |  | **세간/비품**  
---|---|---|---|---  
1. | 비용 | $134,000 |  | $10,000  
2. | 재해 전 FMV | $147,500 |  | $8,000  
3. | 재해 후 FMV | _100,000_ |  | _5,000_  
4. | FMV의 감소 ( 라인 2 − 라인 3) | $47,500 |  | $3,000  
5. | 라인 1 또는 라인 4중 작은 값 | $47,500 |  | $3,000  
6. | 차감 예상 보험금 | _-0-_ |  | _-0-_  
7. | 상환 후 손실 | $47,500 |  | $3,000  
8. | 총 손실 | $50,500  
9. | $100 차감 | _100_  
10. | $100 규칙 후 손실 | $50,400  
11. | AGI $71,000의 10%를 차감 | _7,100_  
12. | **재해 손실 공제 금액** | **$43,300**  
**양식 1040-X에서 손실을 신고하는 방법.**
양식 1040-X에서 공제액을 조정해야 합니다. 양식 1040-X의 지침을 통해 이 작업을 수행하는 방법을 알 수 있습니다. 조정하는 이유를 설명하고 양식 4684를 첨부하여 손실을 파악한 방법을 보여주십시오. 이전의 [_손실 파악_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225224 "손실 파악")을 참고하십시오.
손상 또는 파괴된 자산이 비사업 자산**이였으며** 기존 신고서에서 항목별 공제를 하지 않은 경우, 먼저 재해 손실 공제가 이제 항목별 공제를 하기에 유리하게 하는지 여부를 판단해야 합니다. 재해 손실 공제 및 기타 항목별 공제의 총액이 표준 공제액보다 많으면 항목화하는 것이 유리합니다. 항목화하는 경우 스케줄 A (양식 1040) 또는 스케줄 A (양식 1040-NR)와 양식 4684를 첨부하여 수정된 신고서를 제출하십시오. 양식 1040-X를 작성하여 세금을 다시 계산하고 환급금을 받으십시오. 
_**기록.**_
손실 공제를 증빙하는 기록을 보관해야 합니다. 수정 신고서에 이 기록을 첨부할 필요는 없습니다.
기록이 파괴되거나 손실된 경우, 기록을 재구성해야 할 수 있습니다. 기록 재구성에 대한 정보는 [IRS.gov/Newsroom/Reconstructing-Records-After-a-Natural-Disaster-or-Casualty-Loss(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/reconstructing-records-after-a-natural-disaster-or-casualty-loss)에서 확인거나 또는 [간행물 3067, IRS 재난 지원-연방 선포 재난 지역(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3067.pdf)을 참고하십시오.
_**전년도 세금 신고서 사본이 필요하신가요?**_
전년도 세금 신고서 사본이 있는 경우, 양식 1040-X를 작성하는 것이 더 쉽습니다. 세무 대리인이 세금 신고서를 작성한 경우, 세무 대리인은 세금 신고서 사본을 제공할 수 있어야 합니다. 그렇지 않은 경우, IRS에 양식 4506을 제출하여 사본을 받을 수 있습니다. 각 신고서 요청에 대한 수수료가 있습니다. 그러나 주 거주지, 주 사업장 또는 세금 기록이 연방에서 선포한 재난 지역에 있는 경우 이 수수료가 면제됩니다. 양식 4506의 위쪽 여백에 재난의 이름을 기입하십시오 (예: “Tennessee Tropical Storm Helene” (테네시 열대성 폭풍 헬렌).
#### 기타 재난 사안
**재고자산에 대한 재난 손실.**
귀하의 자산 손실이 재해 손실로 적격하며 FEMA가 지정한 공공 또는 개인 지원 (또는 둘다)에 대한 연방 선포 재난에서 비롯된다면, 귀하의 신고서 또는 바로 이전 연도의 수정된 신고서에서 손실 공제를 하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 손실액이 재고자산으로 중복 신고되지 않게 손실 연도에 기초재고액을 감소시키십시오.
**취소된 연방 대출.**
스태포드 법에 따라 연방 재난 대출의 일부가 취소된 경우 손실에 대한 상환금으로 간주됩니다. 취소는 재해 손실 공제를 감소시킵니다. 
**연방 재난 보조금.**
필수적인 비용 또는 의료, 치과 진료, 주택, 개인 자산, 교통 또는 장례 비용에 대한 심각한 필요를 충족시키는 데 도움이 되는 보조금이 지급되는 경우, 스태포드 법에 따라 지급되는 재난 후 보조금을 소득에 포함하지 마십시오. 재해 손실이나 의료 비용이 재난 보조금으로 명확히 상환되는 범위 내에서 이를 공제하지 마십시오. 재해 손실이 보조금에 의해 명확히 상환되고 귀하가 재해 손실을 공제한 연도 이후에 보조금을 받은 경우, 이전의 [_손실 공제 후 받은 상환금_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225285 "손실 공제 후 받은 상환금")을 참고하십시오. 스태포드 법에 따른 실업 수당은 과세대상 실업수당입니다. 
**사업체를 위한 주 재난 보조금.**
재난으로 인해 자산이 손상되거나 파괴되어 발생한 손실에 대해 사업체의 손실의 상환을 위해 주 정부 프로그램에서 법인이 받는 보조금은 일반적 복지 제외에 따라 소득에서 제외할 수 없으며, 증여, 적격 재난 보조금 (다음에 설명), 또는 자본에 대한 기여로 제외할 수 없습니다. 그러나, 사업체가 일정 기간 내에 적격 교체 자산을 구입하는 경우 지원금에서 실현된 이득 신고를 연기하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이전의 [_이득의 연기_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225354 "이득의 연기")를 참고하여 적용되는 규칙을 확인하십시오. 
**적격 재난 지원금.**
적격 재난 지원금으로 보상되는 경비는 다른 보험금 또는 기타 상환을 통해 보상되지 않는 범위까지 개인의 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 이 지원금에는 소득세, 자영업세 또는 고용세 (사회보장세, 메디케어, 연방 실업세)가 적용되지 않습니다. 이러한 지급금에는 원천징수가 적용되지 않습니다.
적격 재난 지원금에는 다음 비용에 대한 귀하가 수령한 지급금 (출처 관계없음)이 포함됩니다.
  * 연방 선포 재난의 결과로 발생한 합리적이고 필요한 개인, 가족, 생활 또는 장례 비용.
  * 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 개인 주거지의 수리 또는 복원을 위한 합리적이고 필요한 비용. (개인 주거지는 임대 주거지 또는 본인이 소유한 주거지일 수 있습니다.)
  * 연방에서 선포한 재난으로 인한 개인 주거지 내용물의 수리 또는 교체를 위한 합리적이고 필요한 비용.


적격 재난 보조금에는 연방 선언 재난과 관련된 연방 정부, 주 정부 또는 지방 정부가 재난으로 피해를 입은 개인에게 지급한 금액도 포함됩니다. 이러한 지급은 정부 기금에서 이루어져야 하고, 개인 또는 가족의 필요에 따라 이루어져야 하며, 서비스에 대한 보상이 아니어야 합니다. 사업체에 대한 지급금은 일반적으로 적격하지 않습니다.
_**이스트 팔레스타인 재난 지원금.**_
2023년 2월 3일 오하이오주 이스트 팔레스타인 열차 탈선 관련 특정 지원금은 비과세 대상입니다. 2023년 2월 3일 당일, 정부 기관, Norfolk Southern Railway (그 자회사, 보험사, 대리인 또는 관련 개인 포함)으로부터 지원금을 받은 경우, 이 지원금을 소득에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 또한, 이 금액은 다음에 대한 보상이여야 합니다.
  * 손실, 피해, 또는 비용.
  * 부동산 가치의 하락.
  * 부동산과 연관된 클로징 비용 (복비 포함).
  * 불편함 (부동산에 접근 포함).


.![This is an Image: caution.gif](https://www.irs.gov/pub/xml_bc/caution.gif)_적격 재난 지원금은 다음을 포함하지 않습니다:_.
  * _보험회사에서 지불한 비용에 대한 지급금 또는 다른 상환금, 혹은,_
  * _임금 손실, 사업 소득 손실 또는 실업 수당과 같은 소득 대체 지급금._


.
**적격 산불 지원금.**
일부 적격 산불 지원금은 이러한 지원금으로 보상된 귀하의 손실, 비용 또는 손해가 보험이나 기타 상환금으로 달리 보상되지 않은 경우 과세 대상이 아닙니다. 2015년 또는 그 이후에 연방 재해로 선언된 산림 또는 산맥 화재에 대해 2020년 1월 1일부터 2025년 12월 31일 사이에 받은 적격 산불 지원금을 제외할 수 있습니다. 
적격 산불 지원금에는 아래를 포함한 손실, 비용 또는 손상에 대해 받는 모든 금액이 포함됩니다. 
  * 추가적 살림 비용,
  * 임금 손실 (임금을 지급했을 고용주가 지급한 보수 제외)
  * 상해 및 사망
  * 정신적 피해. 


적격 산불 지원금으로 보상을 받았다면 이와 관련된 비용에 대한 세액공제 또는 공제, 혹은 자산의 기초가액을 증가시킬 수 없습니다.
**적격 재난 지원금.**
스태포드 법 또는 국가 홍수 보험 법 (2005년 4월 15일 시행)에 따라 지급되는 적격 재난 지원금은 소득에 포함되지 않습니다. 이는 자산 소유주인 귀하가 향후 자산 피해의 위험을 줄이기 위해 지급받는 금액입니다. 해당 지급액과 관련하여 지출한 비용에 대해 자산의 기초가액이 증가하거나 공제 또는 세액공제를 받을 수 없습니다. 
**위험 완화 프로그램에 따른 자산 매각.**
일반적으로, 자산을 매각하거나 양도하는 경우, 해당 자산이 주 거주지가 아니라면, 세금 목적으로 이득 또는 손실을 인식해야 합니다. 이득을 신고하거나 이득을 인식한 연도에 대한 세금 신고서에서 손실을 공제합니다. (개인 용도 자산에 대한 손실을 공제할 수 없습니다. 다만 손실이 이전에 설명한 [재해](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225200 "재해")의 결과라면 가능합니다.) 그러나 위험 완화 프로그램에 따라 자산을 연방 정부, 주 또는 지방 정부 또는 인도 부족 정부에 매각하거나 양도하는 경우, 일정 기간 내에 적격 교체 자산을 구입한다면 이득 신고를 연기하도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 이전의 _[이득의 연기](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225354 "이득의 연기") _를 참고하여 적용되는 규칙을 확인하십시오.
**이득.**
연방에서 선포한 재난 지역에서 손상되거나 파괴된 자산에 대한 이득 신고를 연기하는 경우 특별 규칙이 적용됩니다. 이러한 특별 규칙에 대해서는 이전의 논의한
  * _[재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225368 "재난 지역에 위치한 주 거주지.")_ (_교체 자산에서)와_
  * _[연방에서 선포한 재난 지역에 위치한 사업용 또는 소득창출 자산](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225371 "연방 선포 재난 지역에 위치한 사업 또는 소득창출 자산.")_ (_교체 자산에서)을 참고하십시오._

#### 연기된 세금 신고 마감일
IRS는 연방에서 선포한 재해로 인해 영향을 받는 납세자의 특정 세금 신고 마감일을 최대 1년까지 연기할 수 있습니다. IRS는 소득세, 특별 소비세 및 고용세 신고서 제출, 소득세, 특별 소비세 및 고용세 납부, 전통적인 IRA 또는 Roth IRA에 대한 기여 등의 세금 신고 마감일을 연장할 수 있습니다.
세금 신고 기한이 연기되는 경우 IRS는 해당 지역의 납세 연기를 공표하고 필요한 경우 국세 통칙, 국세 절차, 통지, 공고 또는 IRS 회보 (IRB)의 기타 지침을 게시할 것입니다. [IRS.gov/DisasterTaxRelief](https://www.irs.gov/ko/newsroom/tax-relief-in-disaster-situations)에서 해당 지역의 세금 납부 기한이 연기되었는지 확인합니다.
**자격 대상자.**
IRS가 세금 신고 마감일을 연기하는 경우, 다음 납세자에게 연기할 자격이 있습니다. 
  * 주 거주지가 [보장 재난 지역에 위치하는 모든 개인](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225446 "보장되는 재난 지역.") (나중에 정의).
  * 주 사업장이 보장 재난 지역에 위치한 사업체 또는 개인 사업자.
  * 공인된 정부 또는 자선 단체에 소속된 구호 인력으로서 보장 재난 지역의 구호 활동을 지원하는 모든 개인.
  * 연기된 세금 신고 기한을 맞추기 위해 기록이 필요한 개인, 법인 또는 개인 사업자로, 그 기록이 보장 재난 지역에 위치하는 경우. 주 거주지 또는 주 사업장은 보장 재난 지역에 위치할 필요가 없습니다.
  * 연기된 세금 신고 기한을 맞추기 위해 세금 기록이 필요한 유산 또는 신탁으로, 그 기록이 보장 재난 지역에 위치하는 경우.
  * 연기할 자격이 있는 납세자와 공동 신고서 제출을 하는 배우자.
  * 재해 지역에 있지 않지만 연기된 세금 신고 기한을 맞추기 위해 필요한 기록이 보장 재해 지역에 있는 개인, 사업체 또는 개인 사업자.
  * 재난으로 인해 사망하거나 부상당한, 재난 지역을 방문하는 모든 개인.
  * 그 외 연방에서 선포한 재해로 인해 IRS가 영향을 받는 것으로 판단한 사람.


_**보장되는 재난 지역.**_
이 지역은 연방에서 선포한 재난 지역으로 IRS는 세금 신고 기한을 최대 1년까지 연기하기로 결정한 곳입니다. 
**의무적 60일 연기.**
2019년 12월 20일 이후에 발생한 연방 선포 재난에 영향을 받은 특정 납세자들은 소득세, 특별사용세, 및 고용세 신고 및 납부, 그리고 전통적 또는 Roth IRA 기여와 같은 세금 신고 기한에 대한 의무적 60일 연기에 적격할 수도 있습니다. 
재난 선포에 명시된 가장 이른 재난 발생 날짜를 시작으로 가장 이른 발생일 또는 선포일로부터 60일 (둘 중 더 늦게 오는 기간)까지가 기한일 연장 기간입니다.
연기를 비롯한 귀하의 지역에 있는 재난 경감에 대한 더 자세한 정보르 보려면 [전국 IRS 뉴스(영어)](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/around-the-nation)를 방문하십시오.
**이자 및 과징금의 감면.**
IRS는 세금 신고 마감일을 연기하는 동안, 미납 소득세에 대한 이자 및 과징금을 감면할 수 있습니다. 
#### 연방 재난 관리청 (FEMA)에 문의하기
FEMA에서 정보를 얻으려면 [DisasterAssistance.gov(영어)](https://www.disasterassistance.gov)을 방문하거나 다음 전화번호로 전화하십시오. 이 번호는 연방 정부가 재난을 선포한 후에만 활성화됩니다.
  * 800-621-3362.
  * 청각 장애, 난청 또는 언어 장애가 있는 경우, 711에 전화하여 TRS 상담원에게 800-462-7585 번호를 제공하십시오.


#### 손익 신고 방법
손익을 신고하는 방법은 해당 자산이 사업 자산인지, 소득창출 자산인지, 또는 개인 용도 자산인지에 따라 달라집니다.
**개인 용도 자산.**
손실이 있는 경우, 다음 두 가지를 모두 사용하십시오. 
  * 양식 4684.
  * 스케줄 A (양식 1040) (또는 귀하가 비거주 외국인인 경우, 스케줄 A (양식 1040-NR)).


이득이 있는 경우, 다음 두 가지를 모두 사용하여 신고하십시오. 
  * 양식 4684.
  * 스케줄 D (양식 1040).


연기한 이득을 이런 양식에서 신고하지 않습니다. 이득을 연기하기로 선택한 경우, 이전의 [_이득을 연기하는 방법_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225390 "이득을 연기하는 방법")을 참고하십시오.
**사업 및 소득창출 자산.**
귀하의 손익을 신고할 때 양식 4684를 사용하십시오. 또한 다음에서 설명한 바와 같이 다른 양식으로 손익을 신고해야 합니다.
_**1년 이하로 보유한 자산.**_
개인들은 소득창출 자산의 손실을 스케줄 A (양식 1040)를 사용해 신고합니다. 사업 및 소득창출 자산으로 인한 이득과 사업 자산으로 인한 손실을 합산하고 순이득 또는 손실을 양식 4797을 사용해 신고합니다. 만약 양식 4797을 별도로 제출할 필요가 없는 경우, 양식 4797에서 식별된 세금 신고서의 항목에 순손익만 입력하십시오 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출하는 개인의 경우, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 4입니다). 그 라인 옆에, “Form 4684”를 입력하십시오. 파트너쉽과 S법인은 양식 4684의 지침을 참고하여 이러한 손익의 신고 위치를 알아보십시오.
_**1년 이상 보유한 자산.**_
사업 및 소득창출 자산으로 인한 손실이 이러한 유형의 자산으로 인한 이익을 초과하는 경우 사업 자산으로 인한 손실을 사업 및 소득창출 자산에 의한 총이익과 결합합니다. 순이익 또는 손실을 일반적인 이익 또는 손실로 양식 4797을 사용해 신고하십시오. 만약 양식 4797을 별도로 제출할 필요가 없는 경우 양식 4797에서 식별된 세금 신고서의 라인에 순손익만 입력합니다 (양식 1040 또는 1040-SR을 제출하는 개인의 경우, 스케줄 1 (양식 1040), 라인 4입니다). 그 라인 옆에, “Form 4684”를 입력하십시오. 개인이 소득창출 자산의 손실을 공제하려면 스케줄 A (양식 1040)를 사용하십시오. 파트너쉽과 S법인은 양식 4684를 참고하여 이러한 손익을 어디에 신고해야 하는지 알아보십시오. 
사업 및 소득창출 자산으로 인한 손실이 이러한 유형의 자산으로 인한 이익보다 작거나 같은 경우, 순 금액을 양식 4797을 사용해 신고하십시오. 또한 이득을 신고하기 위해 스케줄 D (양식 1040)를 사용해야 할 수도 있으며, 이는 다른 거래가 있는지 여부에 따라 달라집니다. 파트너쉽과 S법인은 양식 4684를 참고하여 이러한 손익을 어디에 신고해야 하는지 알아보십시오. 
_**감가상각 자산.**_
손상되거나 도난당한 자산이 1년 이상을 보유한 감가상각 가능 자산인 경우, 이익의 전부 또는 일부를 감가상각이 허용된 또는 허용 가능 범위까지 경상 소득으로 처리해야 할 수 있습니다. 이득의 경상 소득 부분을 양식 4797의 파트 III에서 계산하십시오. 간행물 544의 3장 _감가상각 재평가_ 에서 환입 규칙에 대한 자세한 정보를 확인하십시오. 
#### 기초가액 조정
재해 또는 도난 손실이 있는 경우, 수령한 보험금 또는 기타 상환금과 공제 가능 손실액을 자산의 기초가액에서 차감해야 합니다. 이 결과가 자산의 조정된 기초가액입니다.
위에서 설명한 기초가액 조정사항 중 하나를 조정하는 경우 재해 이전 상태로 자산을 복원하기 위한 수리에 지출하는 금액은 조정된 기초가액을 증가시킵니다. 어떠한 적격한 재해 경감 지급으로도 자산의 기초가액을 증가시키지 않습니다 (이전에 논의한 [_재난 지역 손실_](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p547ko#en_US_2024_publink1000225406 "재난 지역 손실") 참고). 조정된 기초가액에 대한 자세한 내용은 간행물 551에서 _조정된 기초가액_ 을 참고하십시오.
#### 만약 공제액이 소득보다 많을 경우
재해 또는 도난 손실 공제로 인해 해당 연도의 공제액이 해당 연도의 소득보다 많은 경우 순영업손실 (NOL)이 발생할 수 있습니다. 재해 또는 도난 손실로 인한 NOL을 위해 사업에 종사하고 있을 필요가 없습니다. 자세한 내용은, 양식 172의 지침을 참고하십시오.
#### 세금 관련 도움을 받는 방법
세금 문제에 대해 궁금한 점이 있거나, 세금 신고서 작성하는 도움이 필요하거나, 무료 간행물, 양식 또는 지침을 다운로드하려면 [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/ko)를 방문하여 즉시 도움이 될 수 있는 자료를 찾으십시오.
**세금 신고서 작성 및 제출.**
모든 임금 및 소득 내역서 (양식 W-2, W-2G, 1099-R, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC 등), 실업 수당 내역서 (우편 또는 디지털 형식으로) 또는 기타 정부 지급 내역서 (양식 1099-G), 은행 및 투자 회사로부터 이자, 배당금 및 퇴직 내역서 (양식 1099)를 받은 후, 세금 신고서를 작성하고 제출할 수 있는 몇 가지 옵션을 선택할 수 있습니다. 세금 신고서를 직접 준비하거나 무료 신고서 작성대행 자격을 충족하는지 확인하거나 세무사를 고용하여 신고서를 작성할 수 있습니다.
**세금 신고서 작성 무료 옵션.**
온라인 또는 지역 커뮤니티에서 다음을 포함한 신고서 작성 및 제출 옵션을 확인할 수 있습니다.
