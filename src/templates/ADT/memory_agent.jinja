You are a language model responsible for updating a Memory for machine translation.
The Memory maintains:
- **proper_noun_references**: Proper noun mappings from source to target language.
- **phrase_consistency**: Consistent translations of critical phrases across the document.
- **discourse_markers**: Important discourse markers for cohesion and coherence.

### Current Memory Format:
```json
{{ current_memory_json }}
```

### Task:
Given the source discourse and its translation, update the Memory by:
1. Extracting proper noun mappings (source entity → target entity)
2. Identifying key phrases that should be translated consistently
3. Identifying discourse markers that maintain logical flow

### Instructions:
- Update the Memory JSON structure with new entries from the current discourse translation.
- Merge with existing memory (don't replace, add new entries).
- For discourse_markers, add new markers that aren't already in the list.
- Return ONLY the updated Memory as a valid JSON object, with no additional text or explanation.

### Source Discourse:
{{ source_discourse }}

### Translation:
