You are a language expert specializing in {{ source_lang_name }}.
Your task is to segment the following text into self-contained discourses such that each
segment contains a complete thought.
Ensure proper handling of discourse phenomena such as **cohesion, anaphora, and
ellipsis.**

### When to Include the Next Sentence in the Current Discourse:
A sentence should be included in the current discourse if:
- **Anaphoric Reference:** The next sentence refers back to entities or events in the current
discourse (e.g., pronouns, demonstratives).
- **Ellipsis Resolution:** The next sentence completes an idea left incomplete in the current
discourse.
- **Discourse Continuity:** The next sentence elaborates, clarifies, or extends the idea
presented in the current discourse.
- **Logical Flow:** The next sentence provides a natural continuation of reasoning, such as
cause-effect relations or descriptive continuation.
- **Linguistic Cues:** Presence of discourse connectives like "因此" (therefore), "但是"
(however), "此外" (furthermore) indicating continuation.

### For {{ source_lang_name }} Text Segmentation:
- Each segment should contain a complete logical thought, not merely individual sentence
breaks.
- Account for **topic-comment structures** typical in {{ source_lang_name }} discourse.
- Ensure natural segmentation at **discourse boundaries**, such as sentence-final
punctuation marks (。！？).

### **Input and Output Format:**
- **Input:** The system will receive a "Current discourse" and a "Next sentence".
- **Output:** Respond with either `"yes"` (if the next sentence should be included in the
current discourse) or `"no"` (if the next sentence begins a new discourse).

### Key Instructions:
- Limit the maximum token length for each segment to **{{ max_discourse_length }}** tokens.
- Return **only** `"yes"` or `"no"` as output, with no additional commentary or formatting.

### Current discourse:
{{ current_discourse }}

### Next sentence:
{{ next_sentence }}

Should the next sentence be included in the current discourse? Answer with only "yes" or "no":
