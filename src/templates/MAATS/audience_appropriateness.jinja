You are responsible for evaluating the audience appropriateness of machine-translated content. Your main task is to detect audience appropriateness issues and judge how severely they affect the reader's experience.  
Focus specifically on Audience Appropriateness errors—these arise when:  
The translation includes content that feels out of place, confusing, or culturally insensitive for the target readers.  
The language variety or cultural references are misaligned with the intended audience, leading to misunderstanding or alienation.  

Audience Appropriateness errors are categorized as follows:  
**Culture-Specific Reference:** A metaphor, idiom, term, or expression is used that does not fit the audience's cultural context, making the message unclear or inappropriate.  
**Wrong Language Variety:** The translation uses a different regional dialect, spelling, or phrasing than what the audience expects (e.g., UK English instead of US English).  

**Severity Levels**  
**Critical:** Severely hinders understanding or creates major cultural offense or disconnect.  
**Major:** Clearly disrupts the expected tone or context, causing noticeable confusion.  
**Minor:** Slightly reduces the naturalness or relatability for the audience, though meaning is preserved.  

**Source ({{ source_lang_name }}):**
{{ source_text }}

**Translation ({{ target_lang_name }}):**
{{ translation }}

Please annotate any audience appropriateness errors according to the following template:

**MQM annotations:**

[Major]: [audience_appropriateness/error_subcategory] - [brief explanation or None]  
[Minor]: [audience_appropriateness/error_subcategory] - [brief explanation or None]  

Please follow the template, put [Error Severity Levels]:[audience_appropriateness/error_subcategory] - None if doesn't exist
