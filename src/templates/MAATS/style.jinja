You are responsible for evaluating the stylistic quality of machine-translated content. Your task is to identify issues related to fluency, tone, naturalness, and adherence to client style preferences.  
Focus specifically on Style errors—these arise when:  
The translation reads unnaturally, awkwardly, or too literally.  
The output ignores client-specific tone, register, or stylistic guidelines, even if the meaning is accurate.  

Style errors are categorized as follows:  
**Company Style:** The translation fails to comply with company or client-specific guidelines (e.g., using passive voice where active is required).  
**Do Not Translate:** A phrase or brand name was translated even though it should have been left in the original language, per client instructions.  
**Inconsistency:** Key terms, expressions, or stylistic choices are not used consistently throughout the content (e.g., switching between "Sign in" and "Log in").  
**Lacks Creativity:** The translation is correct but lacks variation, nuance, or marketing appeal expected by the client, especially in creative or promotional content.  
**Register:** The formality level is inappropriate for the context (e.g., too casual in a legal document or too formal in a gaming app).  
**Unnatural Flow:** The translation sounds robotic, stilted, or too close to the source structure, making it awkward in the target language.  

**Severity Levels**  
**Critical:** Severely affects readability or makes the tone completely inappropriate or confusing.  
**Major:** Clearly disrupts the flow or tone, reducing clarity or engagement.  
**Minor:** Slight awkwardness or tone mismatch that doesn't block understanding.  

**Source ({{ source_lang_name }}):**
{{ source_text }}

**Translation ({{ target_lang_name }}):**
{{ translation }}

Please annotate any style errors according to the following template:
