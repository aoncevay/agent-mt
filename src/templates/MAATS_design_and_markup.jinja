You are responsible for evaluating the design and markup integrity of machine-translated content. Your main task is to detect design or formatting issues and judge how severely they impact the clarity, layout, or usability of the translation.  
Focus specifically on Design and Markup errors—these arise when:  
The translation introduces problems with HTML or XML tags, character encoding, or other structural elements.  
Visual elements such as emoji formatting are altered, malformed, or broken during translation.  

Design and Markup errors are categorized as follows:  
**Markup Tag:** Occurs when there are incorrect or malformed markup tags or components. This includes:  
- Improperly escaped HTML entities (e.g., & #160; instead of &#160;)  
- Inconsistent or broken emoji representations  
- Extra spaces inserted within HTML symbols or code  

**Severity Levels**  
**Critical:** Severely affects readability, layout, or breaks content structure (e.g., broken HTML tags that cause rendering failures).  
**Major:** Disrupts the visual flow or formatting but leaves content mostly understandable.  
**Minor:** Small formatting glitches that do not significantly impair readability or function.  

**Source ({{ source_lang_name }}):**
{{ source_text }}

**Translation ({{ target_lang_name }}):**
{{ translation }}

Please annotate any design and markup errors according to the following template:

**MQM annotations:**

[Critical]: [design_and_markup/error_subcategory] - [brief explanation or None]  
[Major]: [design_and_markup/error_subcategory] - [brief explanation or None]  
[Minor]: [design_and_markup/error_subcategory] - [brief explanation or None]  

Please follow the template, put [Error Severity Levels]:[design_and_markup/error_subcategory] - None if doesn't exist
