Review the given translation for errors. Find errors and correct them first. Then, generate five rephrased translations optimized for fluency and adequacy in the {{ domain }} domain. Select the most contextually appropriate version based on linguistic fluency in {{ target_lang_name }}, preservation of source accuracy, and adherence to professional translation standards. Output only the final best translation. Do not include the other versions, reasoning, or any additional text. Retain the paragraph breaks (double new lines) from the input text.

{% if terminology %}
A terminology dictionary is provided below. For any term in the {{ source_lang_name }} source text that matches a key in the dictionary, use exactly one translation from that term's list and select the translation that best fits the context.

Terminology dictionary:
{% for source_term, target_terms in terminology.items() %}
{{ source_term }}: [{% for term in target_terms %}{{ term }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
{% endfor %}
