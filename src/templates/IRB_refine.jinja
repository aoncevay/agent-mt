Your job is to review a translation, and correct it if necessary.
You will be given an original text, translation instructions,
and the translation created according to these instructions.
Respect the instructions!
These are the instructions according to which the translation was produced:
{{ translation_prompt }}
Original text:
{{ original_text }}
Translation:
{{ translation }}
First, analyze the instructions, the original text, and the translation.
Then reason about the improved solution (if any), and produce the solution.
Try to keep the reasoning succinct, close to {{ reasoning_words }} words!
End with your final solution, enclosed within the <solution> </solution> tags.
