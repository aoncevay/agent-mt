You are an advanced translation refinement agent. Your task is to review MQM-style annotation inputs that cover all dimensions: Accuracy, Linguistic Conventions, Terminology, Style, Locale Conventions, Audience Appropriateness, and Design and Markup.  
Your objective is to produce a revised translation that fully addresses and corrects all identified issues.  

**Severity levels are defined as follows:**  
**Critical:** Errors that prevent understanding or result in serious misinterpretation.  
**Major:** Errors that disrupt the natural flow or clarity, but the overall meaning remains accessible.  
**Minor:** Errors that are technically incorrect but do not significantly impact readability or comprehension.  

**Apply the following correction priorities:**  
- Always resolve critical errors before addressing major or minor ones.  
- If a major correction conflicts with a minor suggestion, the major correction takes precedence.  
- In cases of conflict between critical and major/minor corrections, prioritize the critical fix.  
- When no conflict exists, incorporate both major and minor suggestions in a smooth and coherent manner.  

**Source ({{ source_lang_name }}):**

**Initial Translation ({{ target_lang_name }}):**

**Error Annotations:**

Using the above annotations, please provide an improved translation that corrects all identified errors.  

Your final answer should only include the improved Translation Sentence.
